one of our housekeeper is pretty known for being a drama starter but she is good at her job let call her jane one day i wa in the laundry room in the morning a housekeeping wa stocking the cart jane is talking about changing the sheet in the stay and how it would be easier if the date people are staying were on the sheet that we print out for them that show the stay and the check out it is our head housekeeper job to write which room need sheet changed anyways and jane is not our hh so i dont know why she care so much anyways i joked about how she should call corporate and tell them to add it and she say there probably is a way to do it there isn t i know for a fact there isn t so of course i tell her that their isn t a way to do it and she tell me that there is a way to do it front desk are just too lazy to figure it out um excuse me what nerve on this chick to say that to me she ha no clue what a front desk clerk doe in a day and she ha no clue how computer even work last week she literally asked me how to send an email but she is sooo sure there is something we could do to make the date print on these sheet i don t know if it is like this at every hotel but at this one for some reason the housekeeping are so attitudey towards the front desk they think that just because our job are not physical like their are our job are just a breeze and that same day right before this conversation happened some guest freaked out at me and almost made me cry because she had to pay tax on her room even though she had a treaty card we are no where near being on treaty land so i wa already in a bad mood
i run a small hotel with a hand operated elevator that only the staff can use i take a drunk couple up and this guy won t stop talking about how hot his wife is admittedly she is quite attractive and they are hanging on each other he s a gruff average joe type dude with a trucker hat and a scruffy beard a i stop on their floor and let them out he give me a whole speech drunk husband look how hot my wife is she s and she is so hot and she doe great stuff for me too she wake up before me every morning and doe her sexy little stripper walk to the bathroom and then she ha a coffee and breakfast waiting for me every morning i have never had that at anytime before her and every day i thank god that i get to spend it with her because she is my whole world and she s hot and she s got a great heart too that s the key she s a great fucking soul i mean it she is my wife and my best friend she listens and care i love her like a brother drunk wife blushing and laughing you love me like a brother drunk husband relaizing what he said but doubling down yeah yeah i love you like a brother but like a hot brother me alright guy have a good night
tonight i had a couple of obviously homeless folk come in and tell me they lost a phone in the bathroom of our restaurant which is next door and locked up i don t think it would be a wise move to go and unlock the empty dark restaurant with two stranger who are obviously a bit on the desperate side coming in with me i am not ready to fight for my life or have to deal with some sort of scam i fibbed a little and told them that i don t have a key to get in true except i could just program one i would also have to have left the front desk empty with the cash drawer i have also heard of a lot of two person scam where they just run one way or the other and grab whatever they can amp x b nope not getting fired or killed tonight
i m not looking forward into going to work tonight because i know a certain coworker is also scheduled i initially liked her a lot when i wa first hired she seemed to take the job seriously she seems to think of herself a head server and often tout about having seniority over everyone the restaurant we work at hasn t even been open a full year yet none of u ha seniority that s a little annoying but i can brush it off thing started coming to a head about a month ago another coworker and i were cut so it wa time to roll silverware there were guest sitting at the table server are allowed to roll at and the table in boh that we sometimes use to roll wa being used for food prep so we set up camp at a server station another popular area to do side work at this station also ha a po computer the restaurant ha two other computer a well a smart device that can be used to input guest order and run credit card it s the end of the shift and it s slow so running with one le computer is really no big deal and setting up a rolling area doe not completely block the computer it just get pushed back about inch well micromanaging coworker absolutely cannot handle this inch she complains that her back hurt and she can t reach the computer even though there are other computer and say that she need to use this one specifically why specifically this one i don t know and she s the only server on at this point so it s not a though the other computer are in use so anytime she need the computer we have to move all our rolling stuff out of the way this is annoying not a huge deal probably added minute to our task whatever so other coworker and i are done with silverware have rolled collectively about set the marking tray are filled but not over filled the restaurant is closed now and we have been cut for about an hour we get micromanaging coworker so we can show her our roll ups an unspoken nicety for the closing server she then somehow make up this rule that we need to wait for all the table to leave so we can roll that silverware i thought she wa joking so i laugh and say no she then undoes our beautifully laid out marking tray and tell u to roll those this doe not sit well with my rolling partner and he blow up at her they are having a moderately loud back and forth disagreement with angry emotion i walk away and grab my manager because i do not get paid to deal with this the solution for that night wa we had rolled enough and were allowed to go home cut to two week ago a weeknight shift two server it s moderately slow but busy enough for two server i get cut around but i still have a table who is enjoying drink until close at pm my table leaf at about pm i grab some freshly washed silverware from dish and see micromanaging coworker doing her closing duty sweeping cleaning up coffee machine etc those task don t take too long pm come along and i m still rolling and the closer is supposed to help finish silverware and dismiss the cut server if there is that much silverware the dishwasher then come out with another load of silverware easily another hundred set i have already rolled at least set by this point i look for my micromanaging coworker so she can help me with the last of the silverware but nope she s gone and left i wa really tired i had been at school all day so tired i didn t even have to energy to be angry but smart enough to know to know this is unfair brought it up to the manager on shift he let me go home the following saturday there s a discussion about silverware at the shift meeting it s agreed upon that a cut person should roll silverware but doe not need to wait around for more silverware to be washed the last of the silverware is the responsibility of the closer cut to this past wednesday again two server me and micromanaging coworker i get cut around my table don t stick around i rolled silverware and it s about pm there have been a decent amount of new table for the new server and the bar rail is also full with guest bus tub are full and in the dish room i can hear the dishwasher running through silverware the busser come up to me and tell me micromanaging coworker is talking crazy crap about me how i m lazy and didn t do enough silverware i decide to not talk to her show my roll ups to my manager and inform them of the shit talking going on he cash me out and say i m free to go i just don t want to deal with her today at the age of you should be mature enough to be able to handle a job and not do thing only on your term she always ha something passive aggressive to say once the spotify list playing wa a rockabilly station she asked my opinion i said it wa ok but i m not much of a music person she then responded oh yeah that make sense you don t have much style i dress very basic jean black nike sorel boot plain target shirt wear basic makeup have normal colored hair and no tattoo or piercings she ha fun hair and makeup a nose ring lot of visible tattoo wear fun skirt and legging she ll try to train the new people to not like a certain manager that s just being insubordinate and she touch her shoulder length hair all the time that s just gross i just don t want to deal with her tonight update tonight she wa the first cut server there were of u before she started rolling she asked the closing server if she really had to roll silverware because she only had x amount of cover she always try to change the rule to suit what benefit her the closer told her no to roll we were a bit busy so the closer wasn t able to follow up if she had actually rolled that many before awful coworker left she came up to me and told me she left a bunch of silverware in the back so you have enough to roll sick of it
an earlier post today about a lady not understanding how otas work jogged my memory re the following tale thanks for the reminder tldr at the end we price match most third party website where i work and we try hard to encourage direct booking where possible sometimes i just can t find the price a potential guest is seeing and tell them they ll have to book online after all not ideal but totally understandable a saving is a saving and many of our guest are loyal enough to be happy to pay the slightly higher rate a the whole payment come straight to u other australian fda will know who i m talking about when i mention the online vid made by a well known millionaire entrepreneur who asked australian to book direct to keep the commission in australia when a guest ha elected to book a bar our sop is to explain the extra flexibility this give them ie the room is guaranteed they can change date and even cancel the room if necessary up to hour before check in start and not be charged a cancellation fee they usually have selected this rate because they aren t sure they are going to be travelling but still want something held in to give them time to plan we also explain the clear rule of prepaid non refundable deal to ensure no misunderstanding and have generally found taking that little extra time in the initial enquiry save complaint later on but of course not all guest listen or recall what they ve been told at the time and others book directly on our website but apparently the rule of the rate are then open to interpretation i once had a significant amount of time wasted by an unreasonable couple who had booked a bar on our website at check in however they expected me to match a non refundable online rate they d found online a they had travelled to our venue that day the bar wa pretty flexible and they d had day leading up to this stay to cancel their booking and rebook while it wa still outside the hour guaranteed check in period if they had wanted to be clever but by check in time the now non refundable payment had already been processed to their credit card in full the night before a per our normal procedure i tried to explain that the rule of the rate they d opted for precluded change or cancellation to a booking within hour of arrival plus you can t just change an agreed upon price after arrival they refused to listen to the reason it wasn t possible and after i said i wouldn t price match either they demanded i cancel their booking and refund their payment so they could book the cheaper rate online and save ten dollar it would have been easier just to give in but i wanted to teach them a lesson in respecting the rule of a booking so i complied before cancelling their booking however i went straight into our blocking system and took that last room type off line smaller hotel with a lot more direct control so it would not display in any online search once released a it wa the last room in a lower rate bracket this wasn t going to be a major issue because i knew i d easily sell it again later when they went to then sit in our foyer using our free internet to go book our last standard room on a third party web site that room wa no longer available they came back to the desk to ask what happened and i said oh no someone else must have grabbed the room after you had me release it unfortunately that s the risk posed until the booking is secured by you what a nuisance and then shook my head sadly saying i couldn t do anything further to take that room back they ended up booking a higher standard room directly with me that wa more expensive than the room rate they had originally held with a lesser discount that i happily price matched it wa a little spiteful i know but they were awful i also sold the room i had taken offline le than ten minute later to a walk in at the full rate too tldr guest want to change the price on check in but can t get their way and demand the booking be cancelled and refunded so they can book online i cancel and refund but then block the room so they can t book it again at the cheaper rate and they are forced to pay even more the second time
normally a server but one with experience in boh a well a in hosting assisting one of the few in my current restaurant willing to shift role from night to night or even mid shift tonight i wa maining a server assist host boh backup had a table come in through our side door blocked with a large clearly marked a frame sign saying to use the main entrance a few minute later they flagged me down asking if they had a server a no one had greeted them yet naturally i asked if the hostess knew they were here a server would have been assigned to their table the moment the hostess sat them through a program we use both at the door and at various po station in front and back of house i got to watch their face redden a they flustered their way through telling me they were regular and are used to seating themselves these arrogant twat thought they could just walk in a blocked off door and seat themselves for valentine dinner at one of the highest ranked bistro in town this year because they ve been in for lunch a few time before nah piss off with that we ve been booked solid for tonight since january for a reason naturally they wanted to speak to a manager lo and behold manager told them the same thing i did we do not have a table for them the one they helped themselves to is booked and could they please get the fuck up and come back with a reservation or at the very least speak to the hostess for our highly in demand dinner table

my hotel offer airport parking where you can book the park and go package with your room or parking alone online thru a rd party so you can either stay with u for the night and take the shuttle to the airport or park your car and take the shuttle to the airport right away i wa checking in a guest and everything wa going smooth and they mention about parking for week i double checked their reservation and noticed it wa booked rd party and it wa clearly not the park and go package i asked for a receipt for the parking and than they got offended i asked that because they were given the courtesy to park here for free before they didn t know any employee name and i had no idea who they are i text my manager what is the policy with airport parking and asked if if she knew who this guest wa obviously she didn t i fired back saying my manager say to follow policy and i can t override a manager they than asked to speak with a manager it wa pm and i am the manager on duty i told my coworkers to not intervene in this at all because i know one of them will bend over for them because he s such a push over they kept telling me a story about how last time they stayed here in december they were able to park here for free i asked for the employee name and manager name that told them this and they didn t know they address these people that told him a the guy and gal i told them the policy had never been like that and who ever told you may have let it slept behind them he and his wife karen started to get mad at me because why am i and the hotel enforcing this policy right now i mention to them i ve been working here for year and the policy ha always been the same we been cracking down on the airport parking because of people taking advantage of it so they re is no way any body could ve told him differently they started mentioning how they been staying here for more than year and i mention how their hotel reward only bring up them staying in december and nothing past that than they gave me another story about how the employee were shocked how they weren t reward member already and they should sign up right which explains why their name only go a far a december at this point i m sticking to policy since there s no way i m going to let these people get free parking because week of free parking is insane they started mentioning another story about past experience they were treated wonderfully and i m making a huge mistake enforcing this policy i kept mentioning the policy is policy and i can t not override a manager decision the wife started yelling at me saying how in the past this ha never been a issue until they ran into me they confessed to paying for parking before and we all of a sudden recently started telling them they didn t need to pay for parking at this point i do what i do best and become the bigger person not by bending over but by not kicking them out and having the police involved the husband started threatening legal action against the hotel and me if i don t give him free parking he started saying i better start filling out application for other job because i could kiss my job goodbye i kept saying policy is policy while texting my manager a update about how they re threatening legal action he made it such a point to have legal action against me and i will be sorry for it thinking back now i should ve kicked him out but i wanted a manager permission first before i did that at this point it s been a hour of back and forth and other guest in the lobby walking by show clear sign of being uncomfortable my coworkers aren t getting involved and letting me handle it like i said they should let me i restate policy is policy and i can t not override a manager decision and i start to retell how the airport parking work to educate them on how it really work and mention my manager name mentioning my manager name wa a bad idea i should ve used a random person s name and call them out saying this person doesn t exist i mention a random name to catch them lying because they kept saying they know who she is and my manager said she doesn t he insisted i give my manager their number because they need to have a chat with a manager about how i am unfairly treating them i got into full policy mode and say a manager is not available to speak with them currently because they aren t on property they will need to be on the clock to talk to you he wasn t listening to that and his wife wa going ape shit in the back their daughter wa just sitting in one of the hotel lobby chair at this point i went back to my fav customer service video with the guest calling the front person the hard r word and gave the guest the manager and assistant manager business card because a of now it s above me if they don t want to listen to me the wife wa then demanding a refund and i mention how i can waive and cancel the reservation if they decide to go somewhere else i than mention since it s a rd party reservation they need to contact who ever they booked the room with for a refund the wife got mad and said no this is unfair you re dumping this all on them because you don t want to help u the husband came back firing at me saying if they can prove they stayed here in the past will i change the policy just for him to get free parking i tell him no policy is policy again he mention how i m making a huge mistake again enforcing this policy he s never been aware of even tho they both mention how they did before pay for parking and now they don t have to which mean they have been stealing from the hotel again everyone should know airport parking is about a day in the city where i work why would a airport property offer free parking it sound insane to be able to leave your car for free for god know how many week im glad if you call the hotel and you ask if the airport parking is too good to be true that you re able to park at a way cheaper price than the airport parking garage and have a shuttle take you to your terminal gate at this point the husband say i have tunnel vision because i m not seeing the big picture here because of his threat of legal action i don t budge because my hotel is behind a very well known brand and their team of lawyer will destroy him if he even decides to take legal action he walked away and said he knew the minute he walked into the hotel that i look like i wouldn t cut him a deal at that point i m like i think he just called me a bitch him and his wife kept yelling at me i m making a huge mistake and i ruin their vacation to hawaii and how i m going to go home and think all of this could ve been avoided if i just let him park for free right before they leave i tell them to have a wonderful night husband get mad and fire back oh no we arent min later the daughter come in saying she know how her dad get and she doesn t believe he handled it correctly and she belief i didn t handle it correctly and that since they were given the option to park here for free for how many week a long a they stay here why can t i just let it pas now for them in my head i m literally fucking laughing they re going to have their daughter sweet talk me and mention to her that policy is policy and i can t override the manager decision and contacting the manager is the best option for this issue at this point it s been about hour of this and another coworker came to relieve me but i stayed to fill out a report about what just happened daughter kept asking the same question and i just explained in detail what my manager said which wa clearly policy is policy and to contact them they will be here at am in the morning to deal with their concern when i first mention that to the husband he fired back we can t call because we will be in hawaii being the bigger person like i said before since she say they don t want to book some where else i mention that they are more than welcome to stay here since they are check into their room currently she mention to me they don t think they have key and i remake them for her and in the end the dad come back to the front desk to pay for the week of parking and later call the front desk to put down what time he want to take the shuttle to the airport like nothing ever happen so in the end they ended up paying for parking and taking the shuttle at am to the airport
i m the guest service manager for a hotel chain that s a brand new hotel month open a a guest service manager i deal with guest issue that s easy what isn t easy is the kid you would expect most parent to continue parenting even while at a hotel but these people think that we are babysitter i got a call from my maintenance manager about kid in the work out area which you need a room key to get into i went in to find two kid on the treadmill boosting it to the fastest speed their parent were nowhere to be found another kid went up to my beverage market cooler took both hand and dragged them against the glass of the door parent nowhere to be found a group of family were in town for a middle school basket ball tournament they were from my hometown and we kicked it off where were their kid the pool splashing and roughhousing personally i witnessed two kid trying to drown a third i told the parent who were getting all liquored up and they acted a if i just killed their buzz kid were in the lobby with their parent two foot away from them kicking a soccer ball around my lobby i spoke to them and told them not to do that and to take it outside where there s le thing to break the parent glared at me like i just spanked their kid i hate kid and the parent who think that just because they are in a hotel mean they don t have to discipline them this is probably why i don t have any kid none that i m aware of anyways until next time haanjobo

howdy ya ll i ve posted before about the sushi counter i serve at when i got this job i wa really optimistic about it the place seemed super chill and i got along well with manager and coworkers so i m very disappointed in how much of a shitshow it turned out to be during my first week i noticed a few cockroach should have been red flag i wa assured that these had come from another restaurant in the strip mall that had recently closed and we re being dealt with month later they are only getting worse customer are noticing and another server told me they had been there for year last week i wa sweeping behind a booth and a whole as nest of like roach came running out this is a franchise based in japan and corporate ha recently tried to improve profit by raising price and making serious staffing cut they cut our dishwasher leaving dish to the cook and server since i am the only server with formal serving experience should have been red flag but i figured everyone start somewhere i work alone on weekday i also host and bus and there s never enough time to actually give good service our google review are low and every day there s a customer complaint about slow service even though i m busting my as all day every day i m getting the feeling i wa hired a damage control because none of the other server are skilled or experienced enough to handle that many people i m being called in at least once a week on my day off because using me a a backup is better for the bottom line than actually scheduling enough people when i do have another server on weekend i m constantly picking up the slack while they spend minute doing some unnecessary task in the back we ve raised our price but are too cheap to order new menu we also started charging for everything from to go box to sauce to extra chopstick i am constantly being accused of lying about price because management raise them without telling me i ve been staying an hour late every night to finish dish because everyone else just dip at our scheduled time off and leaf them for me we have shared tip so understaffing and apathetic coworkers mean i m barely making half of what i wa promised but doing twice a much work because of all of this i decided to put in my notice my manager seemed genuinely shocked i explained to her that there are cockroach everywhere customer are upset and the stress of everything being a constant emergency is bad for my mental and physical health her response well i guess i can t stop you hope you change your mind really you aren t concerned about a bug infestation about your reputation being trashed online because your policy make service terrible that you can t keep qualified staff i ve never been so disappointed in management before i might have stayed if they would have at least offered to work on any of these thing but now i can t wait to get out thanks for reading this long as vent post ya ll i just needed to get it off my chest to people who understand
it s another saturday night in my small town close to the house of mouse and once again we are sold out this is the busy season in florida so we consistently sell out on weekend and sometimes even during the week now i know some hotel chain have a policy that you are supposed to keep a room for super shiny member or walk a guest for a super shiny member but my chain doe not have this policy i will be me in this story and you guessed it super shiny member will be ssm ssm stop and read the sign on my door which say no vacancy and no room available you know just because some people have no idea what vacancy is and after reading the sign proceeds to walk in anyway me hello sir what can we do for you this evening ssm yes i need a room i see that you have no vacancy but i m a super shiny member so you have a room that you keep for u me um unfortunately sir i am all sold out tonight and my hotel ha no such policy ssm your corporate brand requires you to have a room for u super shiny member just in case or you are required to cancel a reservation and give me their room and send them on down the road me sir i can assure you that even though some corporate brand do have this policy we are not one of those brand that do ssm yes you are you people don t know your own policy this is the third property in this brand that doesn t have a room for u super shiny member you should read your policy me i will definitely look into that sir but perhaps if i m the third hotel to tell you that this policy doesn t exist then it quite possibly could be true ssm so now i m a liar is that what you are saying me absolutely not sir you might just be misinformed ssm get me your manager he will set you straight and i ll get my damn room me well sir i am the gm so unfortunately i m it i don t have any room available i don t have one that i m required to hold for super shiny member and i m not going to cancel a reservation because you want a room i do apologize i can try to make some suggestion if you d like ssm nope i ll find a hotel outside of your corporate chain you have lost my business since you can t follow your own policy you ll be hearing from your corporate chain about this me well that is fine sir you have a great night i seriously think this guy ha gotten our chain mixed up with some other chain i don t know how y all that have this policy make it work it would drive me insane i can t wait to hear from our corporate chain about this
because not only is it annoying to have them screaming i want over and over again while the adult are trying to tell me their order and their kid order it s also rude when i wa a kid doing that would ve gotten me a harsh scolding like kid i know you want water i will get you your water but it s your parent fault in the first place the first time i went up to the table your family wa sat at i greeted you all and asked what you would like to drink your parent told me no not ready to order even when i tried to explain i wa there to take drink order and i ll be back later to take food order but when i came back the nd time your parent immediately went into telling me food order and didn t give me drink order until afterward
i m a server at a busy casual dining restaurant to give you an idea we did k friday monday on v day weekend we don t have a tip share system and the amount we tip out to bussers food runner expo and bartender is up to the individual server i tip out based on the rule of my tip go to my busser of my food sale go to the food runner food sale also to expo and alcohol sale to the bartender if i have in food sale amp in alcohol for the night and make busser get divided btw expo amp food runner and to bartender when i train new server i walk them through this process so they have a system to know how much to tip out however i know for a fact several server aren t tipping out at all they are the first one to complain about shitty tip and show everyone when they get stiffed then they leave without giving anything to their support staff imo this is fucking unacceptable i ve worked in restaurant for almost year working my way up from a busser amp expo i know how hard these ppl work amp how frustrating it is when server dont appreciate the work they do so my question for this sub is what can i do i ve posted about this on our facebook page i ve spoken up during our pre shift meeting i ve even personally called out individual server to their face when i know they didn t tip out after the previous shift they always give the same excuse i didn t make shit i did tip out i gave it to x amp y omg i totally forgot i ll give them extra tonight i ve tried everything but nothing ha changed when i heard our best busser left v day after working hour with server in his section completely stiffed him i decided that wa enough and made it my mission to fight for these ppl so reddit what s the best way to get these selfish server to take care of their support staff edit corrected tip of food runner amp expo mean of food sale not also management make it clear that they are not involved in any way with our tip out and can t require u to do so i ve been told that not having tip share is a trade off they give the server in exchange for not having auto gratuity on large party

i m not sure if you will count this a front desk a it s more an operational issue but wa experienced at the front desk and relates directly to our struggle generally if a guest ha a super bad experience and is on an ota reservation it doesn t make sense to award them point or sometimes even buy them dinner a they cost more than the actual stay in this case i ve asked the otas to refund guest and have always been met with complete cooperation we eat their commission but the guest is happy and it doesn t cost u that much current situation guest ha reward night through our brand who doesn t manage u everything go wrong they are legitimately pissed a hell i m sorry so i m going to have the point refunded and not charge the reward program the whole they pay u for the night i ve done this around a dozen time with the reward program over year i spent hour going between guest relation and the reward support desk being told by both the other can solve it both of them tell me they can t do it finally it turn out the guest did a point plus money deal and used night of point and to buy point for the third night for those night we get paid a night so they made and two night worth of point went poof it s brand loyalty they are providing you a huge benefit reward system have to be financially solvent it kinda feel slimy to charge people for point and not pay u any extra of that but it also make some sense the final answer end up being that since the guest stayed at the property the point and money could not be refunded the hotel had to give the guest the equivalent point to compensate them and no no cash back for u to buy the amount of point to refund her from the people that won t refund her is so they want to keep her and charge u to make thing even so here s where it get really fun i took it up the ladder in the brand and they were like well i don t understand it seems like you guy fucked up so why won t you just buy the point i wa like bro you guy made off this and want u to pay to fix it can t you just give them their shit back and charge u we ll see if i have a job tomorrow
i used to work at a dog friendly patio restaurant that serf pizza and sandwich it s a small cozy little spot in a neighborhood good for lunch break from work and evening drink to catch up with friend the afternoon between however is almost always dead between those two time needle to say with a small restaurant and light and trimmed staff the dead zone wa usually ran by the owner who wa and probably still is a massive asshole he took over around cutting all the server and bartender when it slowed down except for one that server left when the last table wa gone meaning you could leave if none else came in after your table left at or you could be stuck till past when the night shift came in if you had camper i liked the extra money so i never really complained about staying after with only one exception which is where this story begin it wa a fairly busy lunch shift that went smoothly no mess ups whatsoever decent tip were made and it wa time to decide who got cut like i said i usually didn t mind being last cut other than it meant working with the owner o from here on out which is always stressful he knew nothing about the service industry or food in general but insisted he did and usually got in the way messing thing up then blaming u or me in this story for the mistake his manic aggressive energy alone could ruin a whole shift the two girl that were first cut began their shift sidework and i kept buzzing around my last few table a couple late s early s an older gentleman and his son regular whom i love a small family and outside on the patio wa a lady and her tiny terrier mix puppy not a stressful set of people i wa a well oiled machine getting thing in place efficiently in my own time and way everything wa timed out perfectly to dovetail then i walk in to the window to see o rearranging and grabbing food before i could stop him me hey o i got it those don t o well obviously you don t god do i have to hold your hand he took out thing in the wrong order from how the young couple wanted it he brought thing the dad and son didn t need and were confused because they specifically said they didn t need it they never do o get flustered easily not good for someone in the service industry and began yelling at me loudly in front of customer blaming it all on me i didn t even argue i grabbed the order for the lady on the patio and took it out asked if she needed anything else she didn t but her dog escaped her lap and followed me to the door he s not allowed inside so i stopped him gently and herded him back to his mama wrong move i guess o from across our small restaurant in front of all our customer loudly what the hell are you doing out there you have people in here waiting for you they weren t and you re out there fucking around with a dog me rushing back to keep him from yelling more i m sorry the dog almost got insi o whatever op go print out your fucking check after all of that i passed out all the check quietly apologizing for o s behavior i received hushed apology back a they handed me their card all my guest signed their check and left i bussed the table and went to enter the tip and finally close out at min till evening shift my regular tipped the normal they always do but the family and lady with the dog tipped closer to but the best of all the young couple who had front row seat to this shit show tip on a bill and on the back of the receipt sorry you have to deal with your bos i kept that slip of paper in my wallet for year tl dr my bos wa a dick to me in front of a bunch of customer a table wrote me a note apologizing for his behavior and tipped me on a dollar ticket so thanks o for the tip i appreciate it

intro i work at a bank it s a special bank because they don t do business with regular person they do business with city social housing insitutions that kind of stuff also i wa a witness to this story not the frontdesk person herself amp x b so i wa entering the entrance hall to wait for my coworkers for our lunchwalk i immediately noticed a man who spoke with an angry voice to our lovely receptionist after some listening i worked out the following the man receives money from a government institution most likely from the city he life in i guess he receives benefit of some kind he doesn t want to receive this money in his bank account he want this transfer to be canceled and want that money to be withdrawn from that city s account instead and to be given to him in cash he knew the account wa with our bank because of the account code the iban account code also show a number of letter unique for each bank he started demanding the money in cash when the receptionist told him we don t even carry cash in the bank and we re not allowed such operation on our customer s account he grew more irate and demanded to speak to the department that handle the bank account the receptionist politely told him that they wouldn t be able to do it either and she wa not going to call them for this i mean really we can t cancel the banking action from our customer on our own accord i m sure you redditors are intelligent enough to figure out the many reason why the man ended his tirade by shouting that he d have her fired and this bank wasn t customer friendly al all then he walked and we never heard from him or saw him again amp x b time for sidenotes the receptionist wa never in danger the man wa angry but not violent and security wa watching the exchange nearby through their tinted glass window for those who wonder why he didn t want his money on his account there are situation where money can be taken out of account automatically like for child support or when you re in so much debt that institution step in and take control of your finance to help you pay off your living expense and pay off your debt it s a thing where i live it a bit more complicated then this but that s the gist of it who know he may have thought that if money never land on his account no institution can take it
if my sidework is done silverware is done i personally drop the check off at closing no matter where they are in their meal then a little later walk up and grab the obviously untouched check presenter and say i ll be right back with this for you they typically say something along the line of oh we haven t put anything in there yet i then clearly check my watch and say oh absolutely no problem i ll swing back by in just a moment then if it s late enough i will repeat this a many time a it take watching my tip dwindle without remorse

a good wholesome story i m on mobile so sorry for any formatting weirdness i work at a mid range hotel and one of our thing is having soft baked cooky out i had a pleasant interaction with some guest checking in recommended a local pizza place to them that they seemed excited about one of my favorite thing about my city is the wealth of local restaurant and they sent up to their room with no fuss they were coming back with leftover pizza in hand a i wa refilling the cooky and asked if they could interrupt my work and grab some which is unheard of most of the time people will either just stand there or rudely push their way past me i happily obliged and told them the brand had pretty much ruined other cooky for me this lady turned to me and wa like i think it s you that make them so good it s just a little thing but it really made my day it s nice having proof that not everyone is a pile of garbage
unfortunately closure doesn t always mean justice however two week ago i thought i d be fired after i let some soft spoken boy convince me that pending authorization would go through yeah my mistake i wasn t thinking there s no excuse i think my job still exists out of the company s desperation not only did his card decline for his stay he did very illegal drug in the room and stole the fucking t v the massive flat screen we have in all of our suite i should have been fired i felt horrible it wa nearly k of damage no payment i tried to correct myself and contact his employer obviously wa a lie not only did he not work with that airline the assistant i spoke with kept laughing seriously uncalled for i just couldn t believe such a smooth soft slightly southern feminine voice would belong to such a foul person i recognized it the second i answered the phone today he s asking for a suite three night just like last time he asked if we had room for check in today i knew he wanted to check in now but fumbled around that detail on the mere chance he d actually show up to check in i didn t think he would i wa so sure at some point he d think checking into the hotel he stole the damn t v from would be a bad idea but there wa a chance i wa freaking out called my bos at am to ask her what i could do for payment she told me what to do he showed up and kindly presented his id and said i ve stayed with you before i think you have my name wrong in my system he pull out his card his id match the reservation from before i m sorry sir i say it seems like we have an outstanding balance what that gentle voice wa still convincing from your last stay it seems the starting amount what i had no idea i never got that email my card never decline i m sorry but it s there who can i talk to to fix this it s getting hard to keep firm my manager she get in around noon so i can t check in not without payment i never got that email saying our system doesn t send out email about declined card i never got an email i had no idea it never decline he put his phone to his ear let me step outside and call them real quick i d already accepted that he wa gone few people ever just step outside for a phone call not in the middle of freezing rain he stepped out a normal a ever rounded the corner and left forever no payment i couldn t make up for what i did to this property but i wa able to confront him a final time and i learned my lesson i m proud i feel like a mile high nothing happened and i didn t change what i d done but i feel a bit better

my hotel is a smallish lower tier schmilton hotel in a small town in florida it happens to be valentine weekend this weekend it also happens to be the weekend of one of the largest car racing event in florida probably in the usa and from what i understand is on quite a few list a one of the biggest in the world my hotel happens to be a short drive to said large car racing event not close enough that we re in the thick of it but close enough that when everything in that area sell out people go for u we ve been sold out for basically a month for this busy weekend and yet i have gotten so many call today from people looking to book for this weekend and them being frustrated when i tell them that we are sold out they all go what s happening that you re so sold out everywhere is sold out why gee i wonder when i remind them of the holiday and the racing event they all seem dumbfounded a though this information should not affect them being able to get a room well i m not here for the race good for you still no availability i m here on business not for valentine day hope business is good still no room available one of my favorite thing they ll say is well i didn t know about any of that isn t there anything you can do no how is you not knowing about these event going to change that all the room have already been booked by people who did know about the event they ll really push it though a though we re lying to them about there being no room who s best interest this type of behavior would serve is a mystery to me but the real kicker wa a woman who complained to me that we were being discriminatory to local upon being told we were sold out when i asked her what she meant she said you gave all the room to people from out of town and out of state just because you wanted to make money off of the race you didn t save any room for the local who actually need them just because you knew you could sell them all to the race fan for a higher price why do people think hotel need to put room on reserve for the wildest of reason no we don t save a few select room for local on the off chance one of them will need it when there happens to be a major event in town sorry

hi all fd supervisor here at a fairly upscale hotel and conference center my fd agent and i had a new experience tonight two guest walked to check in my agent went through the whole spiel and when he asked for her id she froze and said she didn t have one her license still had her maiden name on it and anyway it wa back home he asks if she ha any kind of id and she proceeds to show him a picture of her birth certificate on her phone of course the birth certificate still ha her maiden name on it he let her know that unfortunately that is not a valid form of identification and she tell him that it s state issued to which he responds that it s still not a photo id and he can t accept a picture of an id she then huff and proceeds to dig her driver license the one she said wa at home out of her purse and tossed it at him the rest of the check in went smoothly and the lady went up to their room leaving my agent and i utterly baffled that someone would try to use a photo of their birth certificate a a photo id
so tonight i had a guy check in who wa at the highest level of our reward program and had an ungodly number of point with u he come in we joke around about our slopera system being slow and i get him checked in since he s at the top of the heap he got a free upgrade to a suite and didn t even ask for it right out of the box like so many others he did ask about complimentary breakfast schmoliday out instead of schmoliday out express and big room but i cut a couple coupon and he left happy he just came back down and thanked me for the upgrade saying it wa a nice room it s guest like these that give me hope for humanity
i m typing this on mobile so i apologize for any typo or format issue let s start with a little background i work in an upscale restaurant in a very nice part of town we never really have any disruptive issue with our guest even if a server totally botch an order the only complaint we ever receive is the amount of time it take for order to hit the table or that the food is too spicy it s a really chill and sweet gig about a month ago our sister store on the not so pleasant side wa closed down for good many of their customer migrated to our restaurant server usually make around however since the closure of the sister store the tip have been plummeting while the complaint are ridiculous and at all time high the story last night people arrived requesting a table for the hostess immediately sat them and there wa an attempt to greet them when the server approached before she could even say hello the guest began order entree in a very condescending manner keep in mind they are still waiting on other people to arrive after the order wa taken the server asked for drink and wa ignored a she wa leaving to put appetizer in and grab them water thing started escalating you could hear everything that wa happening with this table from the kitchen which wa just a few foot away guest where is she going guest i think she s getting appetizer guest but she didn t even ask u for drink server approach with tray of water guest i didn t ask for that server i brought water for everyone can i get y all something else guest shove water glass back at server spilling most on her guest you didn t even bring lemon scoff bring me a pepsi a the server get their drink she s asking around if anyone else would like the table she somehow managed to keep her cool after the series of event unfolding of course no one would voluntarily take care of that nightmare table when she brought out the appetizer it wa game over for everyone guest claim they were given dirty silverware the odds of this happening are very slim unless there wa a lazy server that didn t care about what they were rolling i didn t get to see the silverware so i can neither confirm nor deny it in unison the six of them get up and start heading towards the door tab not paid yet the manager wa at the host stand and guest begin to go off in his face our server wa rude and our silverware wa gross are you the manager yes sir please lower your voice and tell me what happened so that we can fix it what is your name my name is i need you to write it down for me i m calling corporate i just told you my name it s i don t feel comfortable writing it down for you sir you are a fucking prick if you don t calm down i will call the police fucking call them i don t care at this point the manager get his phone and dial seeing that this guest wa going full karen and there wa no calming him down it looked like it wa going to get physical they almost immediately left and the police arrived shortly afterwards after they were told what happened they told u to call them again if we see them in the restaurant so that we can officially ban them after that incident the restaurant wa damn near silent i hope we never have to see them again tl dr incomplete party came in and and were becoming aggressive after claiming they were given a dirty fork police were called but guest left before they arrived
i know i booked a non cancelable room but haha i need to cancel it you can t cancel that room i ve never had such rude service before i will be reporting you i should be allowed to cancel whatever i want it s my money i understand my name is sarah
so i just had a guest come up confused at why the machine is asking him to insert another dollar to dry his clothes after he already put in a dollar to wash them after a few min of back and forth and myself and coworker scratching our head i proceed to follow him to our guest laundry where he indicates his clothes are in fact in the dryer when i explain to him that yes the dryer do cost to use he proceeds to tell me he already paid the and point to the clear instruction on the dryer after a couple of minute of him explaining i realize and begin to explain to him that our dryer only dry the clothes and he would need to use the washer clearly labeled to actually wash the clothes guest with a priceless look on his face so i just dried dirty laundry and soap me yes sir you did would you like me to get you another box of detergent so you can wash them guest no i think i ll try again later i did put the soap in there so someone will need to clean it out me no problem sir we will get that taken care of the guest silently slinks away a i go grab a vaccum and thank the god of front desk that he used the powdered tide and not the liquid tldr guest tried to wash his clothes in the dryer wa shocked to learn you need to use the washing machine to do that

hello my friend you may remember me for my tale about saving a lizard well today i bring to you another unbelievable and fresh tale about saving chick brought to you by a meeting room guest we had a small meeting room rental today that wa conducting a group orientation each person that arrived for said meeting stopped by the front desk to ask for direction to our meeting room like a flight attendant i d hand gesture and give verbal direction before sending them off one of the attendee caught my eye not just because of the nice green top she wa wearing a oppose to the rest who wore black button ups but because of the faint chirping noise that seemed to emanate from her not thinking much of it aside from oh cool notification tone i gave her the direction and sent her on her way an hour or so later they began to trickle out one by one green blouse lady stop by and asks me if she can have some coffee from the coffee bar normally we charge the meeting room rental an additional fee for those that get coffee but since it wasn t a big rental and no one would notice cup missing on a slow day i gave her and everyone else the go ahead at this point i notice the chirping again it s loud enough to where you can hear it if you re standing next to her but soft enough to where if it went off in a quiet room no one would really notice it now i m not sure if my friendly disposition or the fact i welcomed her to the coffee had gained her trust but she looked at me with a small smile and asked if she could show me a secret i m a curious person so sure why not i kid you not she reached into her shirt and produced an adorable black chick it wa so tiny and could easily fit in one s cleavage i wa in aw and going derpy over it s cuteness yet still i couldn t help but ask the obvious why so she explained to me that she life in a rural area and it the time of year where their hen are hatching their offspring for some reason one particular hen just walked away from her baby and some of them didn t make it so on her way out to go to this meeting she noticed the two chick that survived and quickly scooped them up since she wa running late already she didn t have time to put them in a warm place so her next best option in her shirt and off she went i applaud her for her ingenuity and bravery to show up for a new job orientation with baby chick in her shirt and for obviously saving their life she confided in me how silly she must ve looked holding her hand over her heart to stiffen any excessive noise and had even apologized to the instructor who also seemed to not mind she even let me pet one and take it s picture i can t wait to tell my so when i get home a happy tale versus the usual and unusual complaint i get

omg i have so many story from my last hotel job but not enough patience and time to write them out let s just say the new owner claimed to own hotel in another country yet their action proved otherwise hiring someone with no gm manager hotel anything experience that gm hired someone to be his assistant who also knew nothing and not assistant manager but just his assistant they then hired people all of the same race for the back office payroll hr sale none of them knew what they were doing they had u the front desk take their mandatory training for our brand hotel when we would mention something wa a brand standard amp we had to do it we would get into trouble for talking back or not obeying order finally the brand deemed the hotel unfit to carry the name so we had to make change they hired people to do renovation but when it wasn t happening fast enough and the owner didnt want to pay more money they brought u in we were moving furniture out of the hotel taking down wallpaper taking out carpet the whole shebang i wa told i wa getting a promotion but when they wouldn t pay me my overtime some week i wa working day a week while the hotel wa shut down for renovation i stood my ground i showed them the state law printed it out for them they got mad amp demoted me instead of my promised promotion oh yeah we had to close for renovation amp they had u calling every guest for three month to cancel their reservation and then when the first month were gone we had to do it again over amp over for a year halfway thru there weren t computer or phone turned on in the hotel so they had u in the motel they owned next door calling from our cell phone that s the jist of it but there is so much more from that hellhole eventually when we opened back up i quit a year later the brand came to their sens amp stopped giving them more time to fix it all amp took away the brand name
hello brother i ve been working in restaurant since i wa now serving since i wa and i ve only ever worked corporate recently i landed a gig at a smaller locally owned restaurant think of an upscale twist on your average pub when i met with the gm she told me that they do thing differently from the corporate place that i m used to but given my experience i ll be just fine any tip i m not sure what to expect
for the last year i ve been waiting table at a little family owned noodle place near a college campus it s great there are a lot of super nice regular management is fantastic the chef is a very sweet old guy who is absolutely militant about making sure i am fed it s a generally sweet gig that i am infinitely grateful for there are only ever three or maybe four people in the restaurant at a time a waiter the manager the chef and occasionally a secondary cook the chef and manager are father and son respectively and they re just adorable heartwarming fantastic today i came in to work and found out that a secondary cook that i worked a lot of my shift with i ll call him jack wa fired over the weekend for badmouthing the chef to the manager the chef s son the more the manager told me about the situation the stupider it seemed and tbh i just glazed over a lot of it but in the course of this conversation the manager and i got to talking about jack in general and it went something like this manager m well if there s one thing i can say about jack it s that he wa never late make face that indicates he s about to spill some hot tea but do you know why he wa never late me c no why would i m well did you know that he wa always scheduled to come in to work at c no he always came at half an hour before the end of my shift m yeah he always came in an hour early just to see you c why would he do that i am a big big dumbass m because he had a crush on you the first day you came in and he saw you he came to me and he said hey manager you think i can get with her and i told him i didn t know it wa up to you and then you didn t notice him at all so finally i had to tell him that it just didn t seem like you were interested c eh weird he never said anything to me m remember how he wa always trying to talk to you about his car c wa that flirting blegh i just thought he wa really into car and then thing kind of digressed from there i never ever picked up on the fact that jack had any interest in me and if i had picked up on it i definitely wouldn t have reciprocated i always thought our relationship wa y know congenial but professional but now i feel weird about all of my previous interaction with him and on top of everything else to know that he wa coming in an hour early just to hang around me icky i almost don t believe it but at the same time i have no idea what my manager could stand to gain from making such a thing up
when introducing yourself would you ever ask customer name to build a stronger rapport or is that weird
the cafe i work at recently replaced our table number with those pager that buzz and flash when the order number is called our cashier are careful to tell everyone your number is x this is your pager when it flash green and buzz your food will be ready over on this counter sometimes they even will pick up a pager and demonstrate it how hard can those instruction be i get it when occasionally people come to the wrong counter but constantly we get people who completely ignore the buzzer for five ten fifteen minute the pager doe stop after a minute but when i m calling an order if they don t come right up i will keep entering the number on the remote eventually i ll have to start shouting the number and what s in the order and they still don t come up right away sometimes i ll even have to resort to walking around the dining room shouting the name from the credit card before they answer frankly on some busy day the wheel is already grousing that order are stacking up not paying attention to the little box that say your food is ready and making me find you doesn t help after the order go out i ll even check the pager to make sure it work and usually it doe then you get the impatient customer that insist that the order you re calling must be there because the little red power light is blinking even after you demonstrate what a pager going off look like we tried out a system where the pager had a beep mode for a while those tended to work better because you couldn t ignore the beep if nothing else i could follow the beep to their table if they still didn t come up
i ve been patiently awaiting my account being old enough for this sub so here s a mild one to start off since it s my most recent so i have a pretty regular guest that i just cannot stand he is the manifestation of all of my pet peeve when dealing with guest he ha a whiny monotone voice that always sound like he want you to feel bad for him he never stop talking and he never listens every single encounter go exactly the same way me hi how can i help you annoying guest oh hi i m ag i stay here all the time and i don t have a reservation but i need a room for tonight and i want it at the same super low super special rate i usually get gm is a real good friend of mine and he always give me a really good rate and i want an upgrade to a bigger bed so my wife and i can fit in it but i don t want to pay any extra for it me yeah sure ok i can t really ag oh and i ve been on the road for a couple of week now and since i ve been on the road i m too tired to make it back home and i just got out of the hospital yesterday and i need some extra pillow so that i can sleep and since i just got out of the hospital i need a late check out and gm know me real well and he always let me get a late check out and it s never a problem me ok sir i need you to ag oh yeah and me and gm go way back and we re real good friend and he always treat me well and i always get extra special service and a really good rate and that s why i always come back here because i know he ll give me an extra special deal and go out of his way to help me out with whatever i want me uh huh here s your key now the first time i heard his spiel it didn t bother me too much sure it wa a little annoying the way he just droned on in his whiny voice without even paying attention to what i wa saying but i thought well he seems alright and he did just get out of the hospital so i feel bad for him and he is gm s friend turn out my gm hate this guy can t stand him get real upset that he just never stop talking and always expects special treatment for a dirt cheap rate regardless of how inconvenient or straight up impossible it is gm had him on the do not rent list for a while but because he hadn t really done anything and he s an extra shiny snowflake member corporate said we can t do that so then gm just started telling him that we were sold out this didn t work either because ag would just use his extra shiny snowflake point to book a free room online after finding all this out i wa far le sympathetic to the exact same story every time like maybe he actually is in the hospital every other week but also if he is that should probably be a hint to stop spending week at a time on the road anyway this guy is annoying but he s never given u a real reason to dnr him until now ag come in and the same old song and dance play out then he say not to charge his card until the next day because there s no money in the account until am when he s expecting a transfer immediately every alarm i ve acquired in my time at the front desk start going off at once i know i should just tell him to take a hike but i have a better idea without saying anything i check him in like it won t be a problem knowing full well that it will be the next morning he leaf without stopping by the desk and what a surprise his card still won t authorize the morning fda tried it over and over to no avail i finally come in for my afternoon shift and the card still won t even authorize for a single cent all according to plan i call the number he ha on file and it go straight to voicemail the voicemail message say to call him back at another number but that number isn t even real i find another number attached to his snowflake membership and it s disconnected i can t even email him because all his email address are some variation of obvious throwaway hotelchain com which exist solely to sign up for snowflake point perfect having no other option i call corporate unfortunately he doesn t owe u enough money to have his snowflake status revoked but he s officially dnr at my property and i get to rest easy knowing that i ll never have to deal with him again

year ago in the s i wa the director of security in a busy downtown hotel it wa june and a such graduation season the hotel had a strict no graduation party policy but sometimes parent would make a reservation guarantee the room with their credit card and we would not know any different this happened once and a fellow showed up checked in had his daughter with him and after they went upstairs and got settled in the room he left the address on his reservation showed his home a being local and that should have been a red flag to the fda that checked him in but it wa missed got a call at home around from my midnight security officer she wa a good kid getting some security experience to help her with her application to be a police officer and she wa a tough a nail on the phone she wa cry and saying that all hell had broken loose and several fire alarm have been pulled i lived about minute away threw some jean on hopped on my motorcycle and headed down there a i approached the hotel i found the street in front of the concourse filled with fire truck a couple cop car and an ambulance it wa a sea of flashing light i went in picked up a radio and got the officer s location she replied she wa in a guest room a soon a the elevator door opened on that floor it wa a scene of absolute chaos there were towel and toilet paper everywhere there were cop fireman emts young people milling all around i waded into the sea of people and tried to find my security officer i found her in the guest room and she appeared extremely disheveled apparently during the fracas someone had thrown a glass of beer at her and she wa involved in a wrestling match with some of the guest those were the day before everyone had a camera in their pocket so we had a polaroid camera that we used to take picture to document thing i sent the officer down to the office to retrieve the camera and a couple cartridge of film and we took picture of all of the damage on the floor and in the guest room there wa maybe people in the area that didn t belong they were all non registered guest i kept looking for the guest registered to the room but nobody knew where he wa eventually one of the people i wa talking to recognize the last name and said that the daughter of the same name wa there and he took me to her she wa passed out in the bathtub covered in vomit i took her picture with the polaroid camera then with the help of the police we started systematically escorting people off the property you can imagine the other guest on the floor and are nearby floor were lighting up the phone at the front desk wondering what the hell wa going on unfortunately we were close to sold out that night so we had no room available to move anyone too all the night auditor to do is apologize and reassure them that we were handling the situation what i found most interesting wa the sense of entitlement these non registered guest had a myself my officer or the police were escorting these people off the property they expected u to phone them taxi and then let them sit in the lobby and wait for it some even tried to help themselves to the continental breakfast buffet that get set up in the morning they were very upset when i told them they had to wait on the street especially since it wa raining that morning it took about minute but we eventually got everyone out the passed out girl wa awakened and lo and behold she had a warrant for failure to appear so she wa carted off to jail we got everything back under control cleaned up the best we could and my officer continued her morning duty i went home showered and shaved and came back to work in my suit we had to bring in extra staff to clean the floor top to bottom and rush to get the trashed room back into inventory a we were sold out that night about am that morning the phone call started coming in to our general manager it wa the parent of these kid that we had kicked out for now reason every parent had the same story you kicked my poor little bobby or susie out in the rain why did you do that you owe me free stuff every call wa transferred to me i told him they were non registered guest and a such they had no right whatsoever at our property they were involved in an unauthorized party that caused extensive damage to the hotel and there would be no compensation whatsoever every parent wa shocked there wa no way little bobby or little susie wa involved in any of that kind of stuff my kid doesn t do that doesn t matter to me no compensation will be forthcoming have a nice day finally mid afternoon the call came that we had expected all day and that wa the parent of the girl that had originally booked the room he wa livid and wanted to know why we got his little princess arrested we told him of her antic and that she wa the ring leader of the chaos that had ensued and that we were also tallying the damage bill which would be charged to him he told u he wa a very important man and he wouldn t stand to be treated this way and he wa going to take his business elsewhere etc etc just before he hung up he told u that we will be hearing from his lawyer soon then the next day he showed up unannounced at the gm s office mouthpiece in tow the gm called me to attend the meeting and bring our photographic evidence we all sat down together and the lawyer immediately started making dire threat to u i said nothing and just started laying out the polaroid picture of all of the room damage keeping the picture of the vomit covered unconscious daughter until the very end he picked up that picture examined it closely and i saw all the blood drained out of his face he turned to his lawyer and said we are done here sorry for wasting your time they got up to leave and we said not so fast drew up a quick contract where the recently changed his tune gentleman agreed to pay all damage he wanted a tour of the floor and the room which we gave him and it wa shocking at least it took u about a month to completely repair all damage and get that floor back to we didn t charge him for any lost room revenue even though several room on that floor were out of inventory for a few week but the bill still came to over to his credit the guy paid it without so much a a whimper i wonder how long his little princess took to work that off all front desk personnel received a refresher course in questioning guest about their motif when their address were local
hello fellow npc i bring you the conclusion of the tale nobody wa waiting for plus a couple of interaction that made me look into the camera like i wa in the office first an update for this post reddit com r talesfromthefrontdesk comment c auf there is a curse on my guest we ended up placing a sign saying parking lot to your left in one of the tree on the right of the road curse lifted no more question regarding where our parking lot even though it is still literally across the street from the hotel if anybody know what to do with a bunch of curse ritual ingredient give me a call because they are not refundable we went independent last year and not having to deal with people yelling at you for show just to contact corporate and get vajayjayllion point because of imaginary issue is really nice our manager of year walked out of the job because she tried firing an employee she didn t like no reason just hated them and tried to do shady stuff to fire them she didn t get her way so she walked out which made me the new front desk manager during christmas rush trying to get breakfast supply when everything wa on her locked pc and nobody not even the owner knew where we got stuff from wa really fun you guy uno so that wa not so nice but overall think are going great so we got rid of people complaining to scam corporate for free stuff that left u with not so smart people complaining about stuff how natural selection hasn t gotten them is a mystery for me since i m the new manager i am the one dealing with these lovely being lady wa upset because she saw me setting up breakfast and pouring the milk and juice from plastic gallon she wanted freshly squeezed juice and milk because she wa paying for it and she wasn t gonna take le than that freshly squeezed milk after trying to logically comprehend what she wa requesting and asking her where wa i gonna get a cow in the middle of downtown i spent a good minute trying to explain that what she wa requesting wa a bit out of reach she said she wanted a refund for the breakfast and she wasn t eating any of it sure let me give you back your never saw her again during breakfast for the next couple of day we have a guest satisfaction police which is a remnant of our brand day where if you don t like the room hotel curtain my face or anything else and let me know in the first minute we will refund your money and cancel your reservation no question asked we try to fix whatever it is wrong except my face unfortunately that is what it is but if you are still not happy just go and take your money no reason why to force you to stay this lady checked in telling me it is for her birthday i comp their parking a a little gift and send her her way she saw the room came back to the front desk asked me a few question about the room and left hour later she call me telling me she changed her mind and that her grown as daughter didn t feel right in the room and that she left but decided not to tell me so she want a refund i ask her what she meant with not right so we can fix it and that we do have other room if it wa something specific about that room she get aggressive tell me no just get me my money back you thieve so naturally i told her no you could have gotten a refund with the guest satisfaction policy in the first minute but it is over hour now she throw a fit because yes she signed but she didn t read so it wasn t her fault she apparently is going to sue looking forward to that she also took the parking pas with her which ha a big sign in it saying that if you take it we will charge you a fine i sent her bill through email with a note stating that if she come back with the pas i will refund the fine for taking it she came back a few hour later threw the pas at me it s make of plastic so it kinda slid it way to me and told me i needed to learn compassion because i didn t ask nor care how her daughter wa feeling guest visiting from mexico want a dinner recommendation great i have ton of really cool and not expensive place to recommend around the hotel unfortunately none of those place are good because he only want mexican food but not any kind of mexican food it ha to be authentic like and i quote food that my grandma would make i politely tell him that since i don t know his grandma nor how she cook i can t give him an answer i can give him some recommendation of great mexican restaurant but apparently that s not good enough he wrote a review about how i refused to help him and ruined his stay the power i have to ruin people s vacation is just far too much p s next time bring your grandma a personal chef my dude couple complaint about the vent in the bathroom making too much noise my agent offer them another room and comp their parking a an apology for the issue they don t want another room according to them it is too late to move their stuff pm we offer them the key to another room so they can sleep in another room nearby and keep their stuff in the old room the room wa going to be dirty anyways so might a well no his wife is already in bed and she doesn t want to get up she offer to go take a look maybe she can tighten it up they don t want her in the room she offer the screwdriver so he can tighten it how dare she make him do manual labor in the middle of the night again pm so having exhausted all solution they ended up getting my card from my agent and talking to me in the morning they were staying for one night they want me to fix it confused how can i fix something that a already happened and b wa offered solution but they didn t want to take it he say he doesn t care but he want a solution now i ask him what would be an acceptable solution he doesn t know since nobody know anything and i can t change the building set up for the vent he leaf angry i stay confused and i receive a lovely review about not offering a satisfactory solution and promising never to come back again if only they kept their promise watch the horizon if only amp x b update the lady that wanted a refund hour later posted a review page front desk agent mantuko is rude and nasty teach him how to empathize with customer i m so glad i don t handle review the owner basically said we are a hotel not therapist shrug
on christmas eve a guest became upset with me at check in he immediately start sharing a sad holiday story about why he s in town his sister is having surgery ok this already suck negative christmas vibe aww sorry to hear that i reply with a concerned expression on my face i proceed with the check in it s busy and i got shit to do so i move rather quickly but effectively i feel kinda mean for saying this but it s awkward and uncomfortable when someone give me sad or bad news especially if i ve never met them i m never really sure what to say it s like i m pressured into doing or saying something to alleviate a problem but when it s your personal problem i can t really do anything but sympathize and i don t like sympathizing with stranger anyway my aww wa pretty much the only response to his troubling news and i guess this guest took offense to that because a soon a i asked for the aaa card he became agitated he left it in his car the hotel is strict about seeing this card and any other card that get a qualified rate so i needed to see it poor guy but i get it during the holiday people are stressed out and here you are visiting town for an unfortunate event very sad later after sending out the evening text message to in house guest he sends a message to my fom describing his poor check in experience and a curt front desk agent he say i thought you should know because your people are so important for your business i come here all the time i didn t get my water i take it upon myself to respond with an apology and tell the guest that his indigo tier doesn t include water but we could give him some if he d like to stop by the front desk i m honestly not sure what people expect from u sometimes maybe i could have been more engaging and asked question about his situation or maybe his personal problem are just not my problem
i don t get this practice at all and it happens very frequently my wife and i will go out either together or with a group of people the server hostess manager that seat u at the table brings every person a food menu but only one drink beer wine menu now all four or six of u have to wait for our turn to look to see what we want to drink often enough a server will come by and ask for our drink and they have to wait or come back because not everyone ha had a chance to read off one menu anyone what is the reason

so i m not working in a hotel anymore but i interned for one over the summer didn t really have an interest in the industry but they d work around my other part time job at a grocery store so i could stack up a lot of hour over summer break and they offered a rather nice wage my duty varied very wildly the idea wa for me to get a taste of every single department this occurred during my housekeeping rotation i wa working with a housekeeper knocking out a lot of checkout we had like that day plus stay over bad day we entered one checkout room and we noticed the guest wa still in there but hadn t alerted u when we knocked no big deal he didn t notice u so we go work on other room and will come back thing wa when we check our clipboard this man had checked out so we call down to the front desk so they can try to figure out what is going on about minute later the housekeeper and i were working in the room next to this man when our gm and chief engineer ce come up they knock on his door and eventually just have to open it using the master key shouting then erupts a this man start lunging toward my gm the man then run and is very wobbly out of the room and down the hall just a few foot the gm and ce follow him and he then slip back into his room the gm ce and this man are standing off and there s some light fighting punch thrown but no connection attempt to grab shirt etc until the police arrive and mace the man the housekeeper had called the police the man ha to be dragged out on a gurney because at this point he s too wobbly to walk once the man left the ce and i are sorting through this man room so it can be used again we discover empty can of key board cleaner two empty jar of tylenol blood stained sheet and several empty beer the man wa beyond high apparently this wa only the highlight of what wa a very interesting internship which included fire drill that went poorly kitchen issue a security guard who probably shouldn t be one and so much more tldr man got high and drunk proceeded to fist fight my gm and chief engineer

no really every so often we get people who are staying at some other hotel under our company umbrella and they think that should give them access to the guest laundry at our hotel which we have because we are an extended stay brand we of course say no because our laundry is for our guest but some people even take the complaint to corporate thinking that they ll actually get their way or get u in trouble or even get compensation corporate hold pretty steady to the policy of if you don t have a reservation there they don t have to let you use anything so no big deal until last night last night we had a god status loyalty program member get so upset about this that he created a reservation at our property with the sole purpose of then being able to open a chat through our app and tell u off and then cancelled his reservation and we weren t even able to get the cancellation fee because he used a card with no money on it oh yeah and this guy is on the payroll of one of the united state major sport organization a a referee here s the chat he sent u identifying information removed no need to do laundry anymore because other company property understand how to take care of loyal top tier and next highest tier member with status by the way the manager at the other hotel not managed by our property management company say they have always sent guest to do laundry at your hotel but maybe you are the only one unaware of this relationship use common sense my coworker s name and stop hiding your bias and prejudice behind policy i will be sure to let some very important people at corporate know of this interaction when they attend my company s event next week i ve worked at my property for almost year and yeah that s not a thing buddy but thanks for making your sport organization look like crap good job

i used to work at this place for about half a year and the number of infuriating story ha provided me with great talking point at party for the last year so at least it got that going for it pretty much everything about this place except my co worker wa a total shitshow the place is a small caf and icecream shop in a part of berlin that is mostly inhabited by family owned by an electrician who ha no goddamn clue about how to make food or coffee i ve worked a a barista before and i really take pride in making the best coffee i possibly can first day there i tried to make a cappucino and pour some latte art then proceeded to wipe the steam wand like always i noticed that they used low fat milk which is shit for making good foam and the dose of espresso wa way to low so it didn t have any crema and wa super watery i later suggested to the bos that fat milk would be better and offered to take time after work to adjust the machine he shot me down and said they ve always done it like that well pisspoor coffee it is then apart from the owner being shitty the place wa almost exclusively visited by family a we had a big sandbox in the middle of the terrace and the entire thing wa marketed towards family with kid you can bet your as the parent took this a guess i don t have to watch my crotchgoblins then nearly every time i tried to bring an order to a table some kid walked right into me and almost made me trip but eh who care most customer were super rude just ordered so they can sit and let their kid play tip were shit and cleaning up at the end of the shift wa always a nightmare dried up icecream and trash sticking to it coated basically the whole place since none of the parent had the decency to care for what they re kid did sometimes kid just took bucket of sand inside the caf and played there which made the floor super slippery and i ve slipped several time when i wa the server luckily never with a full tray a few month after i stared working there in the middle of summer it wa super full and the entire staff wa beyond their breaking point because of the shitty management there wa no possible way to get out order in time one time a kid took a dump in the sandbox which riddled the entire terrace with a stench that can hardly be put into word the parent did nothing even though they saw it the kid then proceeded to go on the little slide we had and covered it in shit too parent s did nothing none of the staff member had time to deal with the situation so i asked the bos to talk to the parent he reluctantly did and i heard them argue that kid do thing like these and that it no big deal he then came to me and told me that he would be taking over for me and that i should clean up the sandbox apart from the fact that this wa bullshit him taking over would just send of a cascade of pure chaos since he didn t have a clue which table already ordered which one payed etc at that point i wa already so broken inside from customer yelling at me all day that i just took the shovel and the bucket and did it it wa absolutely foul no idea what that kid ate but even i in my entire year of like have not produced something so vile when i wa done i walked past the parent table and instead of thanking me they informed me that they would like to get another water and a scoop of icecream for the little shitter i told them bos is taking order now which they seemed to ignore after i threw away the bucket and everything that touched it and cleaned my hand for what felt like an hour i see bos having nothing under control ticket are all over the place my coworkers are arguing with him and finished order are melting away on the bar because bos doesn t have a clue where to bring them since i wa the one who took these order so after messing up my entire system messing up the existing ticket by bringing them to wrong table and basically dooming the entire workday he just gave me back the wallet and the orderman and tell me that i could take over now i thought about just handing him my apron and quitting but looking at the face of my coworkers who looked like they had given up on life i decided to try to help them the entire shift after that wa an absolute mess customer refused to pay because of delay order were forgotten yada yada when most of the customer were gone me and my coworkers took a break sat outside in the sun and had a beer before cleaning up none of u talked i would have quit but i did really like my coworkers and didn t want to leave them hanging so i kept working there til my contract ended altough the last month i took all my paid leave overtime and sickdays and still got paid without having to see the owner again fuck that place

this happened a few year ago i used to work night shift at a popular coffee shop our location wa right next to a bar so we got lot of crazy coming in once the bar closed one night after the bar had closed my coworker and i were serving the line of customer in the front when i noticed an older gentleman stumble in and go straight into the bathroom we usually asked that the bathroom were for customer only but there were usually only employee working night so it wa hard to enforce that we served all the customer in line and the gentleman still hasn t left the bathroom yet gross but not unusual unfortunately about hour later i noticed that he still hadn t come out yet my coworker and i were debating on who got to go check on him when he finally came out covered in blood both of u rushed over to him and he had a big gash on the side of his head it looked like he had fallen outside or something we grabbed him a chair and told him to wait here while we called an ambulance for him a soon a we said ambulance he say no no ambulance i m ok and he try to get up and leave my coworker had to physically hold him in the chair while i called the ambulance i told them he wa trying to leave and they told u that we can t force him to stay a we re not medical worker we couldn t force him to get help so i told this to my coworker and he had to let him up a soon a we did he stumbled out of the store dripping blood from the bathroom to the door we both followed him outside and tried to convince him to wait for the ambulance all he kept saying wa no ambulance over and over we just watched a he stumbled away the fire station where the ambulance stay is not too far from the coffee shop and i guess they were having a slow night because they were there in like minute we pointed the guy out to them he wa across the street by now stumbling around still they drove over and must have convinced or forced him to get in because he got in eventually and they drove off i assume to the hospital my coworker and i went back in and took a breath or two a we decided what we had to do obviously one of u is going to have to put on a bunch of glove and clean sanitize everything that guy touched walked past and the other would have to serve customer still a we re deciding who get to do what someone walk out of the bathroom he must have came in while we were dealing with the ambulance outside he start using his phone and snapping picture of the blood on the floor i walked over to him and explained the blood outside the door and on the floor he said there wa blood all over the bathroom neither my coworker or i had a chance to even look at the bathroom yet so i went in and it looked like a horror movie in there there wa blood everywhere on the wall the sink even on the ceiling i quickly locked the door and apologized to the guy i explained everything again but he wa busy taking picture he pulled out a card from his pocket and turn out he wa an off duty health inspector and he wanted to talk to my manager it wa just the two of u working and i wa the supervisor so the highest person available at the moment he explained that he would be sending the picture to his superior and they were going reviewing our license and possibly even shutting u down he asked me to pas his card on to my manager in the morning and have her call him and he left we decided that my coworker would clean up the mess i helped him a much a i could but since i wa serving customer we figured it would be best not to get any blood on me and make thing worse my manager got in in the morning and i told her everything that had happened we reviewed the security tape and sure enough we did see the guy come in while we were out with the ambulance he looked outside and saw u dealing with the ambulance and when he saw the blood it wa like dollar sign went off and he saw his payday we continued watching a he took picture and i talked with him when i went in to check the bathroom something i didn t see wa him ordering a drink from my coworker i didn t even notice it in his hand while we were taking but there it wa my manager and i thought the same thing if this place wa that had that it had to be potentially shut down why did he order a drink my manager called him and brought this up he claimed he didn t know how bad it wa and didn t even drink the drink even though the video show him drinking she asked him to send her the picture too and took after picture to show that we cleaned sanitized everything not what came of it since i wasn t management but we never got shut down and never saw either guy again

it s been a long time since i ve posted here but i ve got a good one i think you ll enjoy i do doordash in the side after work a food delivery service like favor or uber eats i picked up some taco and it wa a large order and i saw the pay wasn t very good for it but i decided to give them the benefit of the doubt thinking they d tip me in person how doe this relate to this sub i wa delivering to a hotel i get to the room their being loud a hell and i have to knock a few time for them to answer they open the door and i wa basically slapped in the face with the smell of weed i hand them the food and they mumble a thanks and shut the door i walk away annoyed for what felt like a waste of time then on my way out i swing by the front desk and ask do you guy have smoking room here the man at the front desk said absolutely not i smile and give them the room number i just delivered to the man thanked me wrote down their room number and i left happy about the justice that s coming their way i know they would have found out anyway because there s not covering that smell up but it felt good being the one to tip them off tip your delivery guy next time
i ve posted a few time before i m a bartender in a place that get a lot of weekly regular and they are sort of like vip at our place so they get special pricing discount on certain thing one of these thing is that they pay le for a soda and get free refill for it one guy dave is hard for me to read but never give me any trouble he always open a tab and when it s time to close out he always asks me to do it for him our po is on an ipad kind of device so he ll have me enter the tip for him he tell me how much to enter and to sign for him he always tip about an average and appropriate amount which i appreciate last week for whatever reason he told me whatever is double it i wa surprised but thanked him profusely after closing out he ordered a soda this guy never skip out on his tab so when i told him it would be and he brushed me off and kept chatting with the other customer at the bar this is not unusual i wasn t worried and i knew he d pay me before leaving come time for him to leave he say goodnight to me and say you were just kidding about the right i told him i wa not kidding wondering if he wa joking nope he start making a big fuss about the fact that i m charging him i thought we got free soda i said you get free refill but the first one is at a discount for you guy then he continues making a fuss thats the price with the discount that s ridiculous that s so much for a soda i can t believe you re charging me for that i m leaving out a lot of fluff because he really just kept going on and on i felt my face getting red i m not good with confrontation and didn t know what to say so i said i m just doing my job the part that bothered me most is what he said next i can t believe this i just tipped you i wa really offended for one thing i never ask for tip and i certainly don t ask for certain amount nobody forced him to give me a tip now he wa making me feel bad about the tip he gave me ranting at me for the price which i don t even have any control over and berating me for literally doing my job what really get me is the way he said that last part wa he insinuating that because he wa such an amazing guy to give me such a big tip that i should give him thing for free or what use part of that tip to buy his soda if it wa such a big deal that he didn t spend any more money why didn t he just tip le and use that for his soda i m telling this story because tonight is his regular night and i m apprehensive i know it s not the biggest deal in the world and he never did give me any trouble before but i do know he s a ball buster i just want to put that little incident behind me and not have him poke fun at me for what happened when i wa just doing my job edit to the redditors telling me i should have just bought the drink and i should buy my regular drink sometimes you re absolutely right and i do indeed do this from time to time i love my job i love my customer and i try my best to take care of them and let them know i genuinely enjoy seeing them and i m not just interested in a tip if i wa really so bad in this scenario then that really bother me and there s unfortunately nothing i can do about it now the reason i shared this is because i wa upset and embarrassed standing there for so long getting yelled at by somebody who i do my best to take care of every week it s nice to treat your regular and i m happy to do it if he hadn t jumped right into a rant over it then maybe i would have felt more inclined to treating him but i don t think i should be bullied into doing it

dearest subreddit it is with great regret that this tale begin with a major bummer i wa working the na at a dual branded property near downtown roughly year ago when about o clock or so in the morning i received a text from my dad that my dear grandmother had passed away it wasn t exactly unexpected she d been going through renal failure dementia loss of sight and hearing and various other end of life symptom still though it wa quite sad and made the night miserable already management had left already and had spent many month making it clear that they don t want to be disturbed for anything other than the hotel being on fire so it s not like i could go home to grieve this night when a brief quiet moment came in the lobby i took the opportunity to step in the back and let a few tear out some more info about the property at when my shift started the first thing i would do is lock the door and attach a large unmissable sign at about eye level that tell any returning guest that they can use their room key on the sensor next to the door to get in and any arriving guest that they can press the intercom button right next to the sensor to be let in so i could check them in it really is impossible to miss this sign folk anyhow i step back out and get back to my work running report and auditing the bar receipt and all that fun stuff when this lady come to the door and start banging on it loudly i know she see the sign because it s impossible to miss and she wa peeking around it to scream through the door i press the intercom button and ask her if i can be of any help i already assumed she wa a returning guest rather than a check in a she didn t have any bag with her and she looked like she had spent the entire night partying it up at the bar downtown sb shrieking banshee let me in now i comply and press the button to open the door and she charge the front desk before she lay into me sb how dare you leave me out there i m a super platinum diamond snowflake and i will not be locked out are you an idiot or something i m a next reward level down from the highest she just claimed to be and i have never been treated with such disrespect before i know mr man whose name is on the front of the hotel and he ll be hearing about this you ll lose your job i can t believe anyone could be this stupid i m a next reward level down from the previous level she claimed to be and i know a lot of highest reward level member and i m going to tell them to stay away from here you ll lose all your business i hope you liked your job while you had you stupid f now dearest subreddit i usually have some smarmy retort or put a stop to this kind of abuse much earlier but i ll refer to the event that started my night to say that i wa a little off my game and distracted so i just let her shriek her drunk little heart out while i fought back what manly tear i had and the not manly one a well she left after her attempt to destroy what little morale i had and i never saw nor heard from her again
some people just don t listen to what your asking and demand the item they already ordered and is being prepared in the back i had this guy sit at my bar after his family left and he stayed because he wanted to get a dessert he ordered a creme br l e and a coffee so i put his order in right away and he watch me do so i then grab his coffee and set it in front of him the conversation went like this here s your coffee sir would you like cream or sugar creme br l e oh yeah i put it in already should be done very shortly did you want cream or sugar or no i want creme br l e at this point i didn t reply just walked away to check to see if his dessert wa done which it wa after i left my friend who wa visiting the bar and talking to me told me after i left to get his dessert he openly said jesus server these day is it just me or wa i a bad server for asking if he wanted cream or sugar while i waited for his dessert to come out if he didn t want them he could have just said so or did i not explain thoroughly enough that the dessert order wa already put in and wa being prepared in the back and he thought i didn t put his order in
so this is from togo so i wasn t really a server at the time at the restaurant that i had worked had this one woman who came in every week always asking for the buffalo wing she always asks for them to be extra crispy and to be slathered in sauce we would do exactly that she would take them and then an hour later she would call and complain that her wing are cold and not crispy enough we would have no choice but to remake them basically giving her a second order of wing for free one night i noticed that she didn t call back the only thing that wa different wa that her order took longer to prepare so it wasn t ready when she arrived so a couple of week later and i start to think of this i decided to test out my theory on her this theory wa that if she believed that her wing were second fresh instead of a minute or so then she wouldn t call back so her order did get ready before she came but i kept it on the line and out of her view for a couple of minute right before it started to melt the togo box i bagged it and gave it to her and what do you know she didn t call back should i have done that maybe not but i wa just so feed up with this woman can you blame me
i am not a server but a hostess not quite sure if it is alright to post here but i ll do it anyway working seven day a week had been and still is a pain in the as yet i managed to quickly get up on my foot and get the job done only today s event at the restaurant did not go well for me a lady walked into the restaurant and asked me to seat her at a booth while she wait for her brother to arrive once i ve given her a booth she left her coat on the bench and told me she will be going to the washroom bathroom and return momentarily i didn t have the energy to speak so i nodded in response i went back to my podium in case customer arrive at the entrance i did my job bussed and wiped table set up cutlery grabbed a pile of menu to put back at the front greeted and sat customer etc a few minute or so a man caucasian half bald big and probably wa in his mid s or s arrived at the entrance how can i help you today sir i politely inquired my sister is here when he said that i immediately remembered the woman i sat earlier who still hasn t come back from the washroom oh sir i think i know who you are talking about your sister is in the washroom right now i ll show you where she will be sitting where did my sister go in the washroom sir i repeated and the most despicable thing i ve ever heard from this ignorant man wa i need to go to the washroom because i have sars on my hand he showed me his huge hand and asked would you like me to give you some sars i have them on my hand i need to wash them quick he chuckled a if it wa funny to him baffled i wa unable to speak i wanted to say something but i just didn t have the energy to i regretted not standing up for myself and instead allowed a ridiculous comment to get out of this person s mouth i am aware that the coronavirus ha been all over the news but that doe not make it okay to tell me and joke about it just because i m asian and think that i got something to do with it he said it right in front of my fucking face he didn t even blink or think for a sec of what he just said to me people like him still exist in this world unfortunately whoever ha gone through an awful situation such a this i am so very sorry you had to experience that he and his sister are regular in our restaurant good thing i remembered his face omfg if i ever see him again i ll slap the sens out of this guy and embarrass him
been working here for month had a sinking feeling on my first day but thought i d give it a month or to make sure after all the tip leaving with in tip only toxic management who let s literally everything slide including degrading comment towards female server from customer i handed in my notice good riddance january hit and i wa only getting shift a week despite having full time written on paper during my hiring some more context our restaurant clientele is mainly so i can t blame them for not knowing how to tip but it still suck
hello all let me preface this by giving a little bit of background i m a young female who is currently still in school well it s online school but that s how i m getting my education this is the first job i ve ever had and since day i feared i wasn t cut out for it since i m really introverted and have trouble not much experience socializing i took this job because it wa one of the only job i wa qualified for and i really needed the extra fund all i did wa apply online and when i came to the restaurant to check on the status of my application i wa hired on the spot i had about three day of training and after that i wa put on the floor which wa a very busy night i did way better than i expected but the whole night i wa there i wa very anxious and only had two table but i survived the first night just fine even though i made some mistake fast forward a month later and i m still working here but here s the catch i worked mostly only day where it wasn t very busy and i only work part time when dinner rush hit and our place is packed i really get stressed out i m not a fast worker however i m good at operating the po but i have to really take my time i still make lot of mistake and i constantly ask question even after a month of being with the company i don t even know how to properly carry tray and i can hardly stomach taking phone in order due to my anxiety we re also very understaffed and it can get hectic with our busiest night only being three server two cook and the assistant manager i m still not used to constantly socializing and working in this extremely fast paced environment and the other day my gm yelled at me and that really triggered my anxiety to the point where i started experiencing tremor in my body from being stressed out when i get anxiety attack i can experience long term physical symptom i m starting to feel like i m not cut out for this type of work even though i only work at night i m really starting to have doubt about staying here due to being very anxious and sensitive i m not exactly on the best term with my gm and i get so stressed out on night when i have to work with him i just don t see myself staying here long term but i feel so guilty about already having thought of quitting even though this is my first job and my family and friend are proud of me i don t want to let anyone down but my mental health ha been taking a hit even on my off day and before i go to work i get anxiety just from thinking about going back to work also i ve been trying to get my weekend off because i need that time to focus on finishing school but my request for off day have been getting ignored i m just not sure if this is good for me anymore sorry for going on a long scattered rant but i ve been keeping a lot on my mind lately
i work at a fast food place and am the ultimate drive thru girl but that mean i can t see the customer when they order especially at close because i m usually helping close up machine before i clock out since i m not a closer just scheduled to close so it s and we close at but i still have the headset on because i ve been helping shut down and clean the ice cream machine and so i hear a ding and turn on the mic to say sorry we re closed so they don t just sit there and scream hello into the box and the lady in the car asks if she can order anything i know it s late to which i say no i m sorry everything s shut down a i finish up my task and she reply but it s been a long day and i wa just at the hospital obviously my answer is still no a everything is off and taken apart or being cleaned so i go to the window because she drive off and she s there waiting and she s in scrub so it wasn t that she wa at the hospital visiting someone it wa that she just got off her shift and instead of going to the open restaurant a block away decides to come to the closed one and beg for food like i get it you just got off work and want fast food but like don t try to get sympathy for being at the hospital when it s your job to be there sorry just needed to rant a i get so many people who come through every night asking if we re still open because the light are on
i had a pack of table two seaters on one side and six top on the other maybe foot separating the table i wa walking with over worth of drink when i wa standing at a table about to put them down this guy storm down the very small hallway and stand there after i ve already been there and in the process of putting the drink down i can see he s getting irritated i did move in a much a i could so he could pas after about second of standing there he just push through me and in the process raising his elbow and knocking the tray all over the guest i look at my table and they look at me astonished about what the guy just did a i look at him a he s walking away he s just smiling and laughing about what he s just done my table of course knew it wasn t me who dropped it and that the guy did it on purpose and when the manager came over they told her what happened and who it wa everyone saw this guy purposely elbow my tray i felt so bad cause it drenched the whole table sadly nothing came from it there wa a large party outside where the guy wa going and nobody could find him to pay for the drink he spilt my manager even went and checked the camera and saw what exactly happened some people
sorry to post again i m a newish server looking to get a nd job during the day and having trouble deciding where to apply the place i m at is usually pretty dead all day on weekday but it is a pub so i m wondering if there are certain kind of restaurant spot around town like business area that might be good to work a a day job though i know sunday s are good money i think i want at least one day off to interact with the rest of the working world so i think i m just going to set my availability mon friday i m jus worried those aren t going to be great shift at many place any thought i appreciate the advice
sorry for shitty formatting i m using my phone to type this working my shift and a seemingly nice middle aged man come to the desk to check out nothing out of the ordinary yet this is where thing get weird he say hey i m checking out of room but i wanted to see if there wa a pet fee posted on my bill i say yes sir it look like there s a pet fee he go id like for you to take that off i noticed your elevator hasn t been inspected since and if you charge me the fee i ll report you guy i say sir extortion is a felony but i hope you have a great day he walked out without saying a word edit thank you to the kind soul who awarded me my very first silver
disclaimer this is a tale from a front desk i don t work at but thought it wa worth sharing i m traveling for the holiday right now and i arrived at my plentiful chain property after midnight and got checked in by a manager not a typical am experience i wondered if they were short staffed but no they weren t he explained that they were trying something during the last two week of the year manager are working extra half shift in different department once their own work is done to give employee especially the night auditor more time with their family not to mention the ability to sleep on slightly more normal schedule so they could participate in daytime holiday activity when they d otherwise be either sleeping or exhausted he wa working until am when someone else would take the other half of the p a this is the first time i ve ever seen that and it s the kind of thing that would make me more loyal a either a guest or an employee and given how many tale of exasperation are posted here on a daily basis i thought something on the nicer end of the holiday story spectrum might be a nice change of pace anyone ever work at a property where your manager covered for you so you could get more family time during the holiday the team culture here seems to be much improved by having leadership that care
this is definitely a step away form the usual bad guest story on this sub but i wanted to share last week at the end of my audit shift one of our regular came in and said we weren t sure what to do we found him under a car out front i had a moment of panic thinking there wa another guy who got drunk and passed out at some time in the night then i looked down and saw what he wa holding a little kitten she couldn t have been older than week it wa am and the guest were going to work and i only had an hour left of my shift so i kept her behind the desk with me while finished hoping no guest complained since we re no pet allowed and that s the story of how i ended up with a kitten she s sitting on my chest and chewing my beard a i type this on my phone and i know i m gonna keep her hope you guy have good shift and enjoy the end of the year
it s still so on point but we need an updated waiting who would play who
this is something i observed year ago i don t work at a restaurant myself but this story belongs here i wa at a chinese buffet minding my own business when the man behind me just start yelling at his waitress and i mean absolutely tearing in to her he wa throwing shit around the table slamming his hand down making the whole booth shake i can t remember what kind of thing he wa saying but he wa upset that he wa charged an extra for the crab leg on the buffet not only doe it very clearly say on the sign outside that the crab leg are an additional but there s a sign directly above the crab leg themselves in big red letter stating it and our waitress told u when we sat down that they were extra so i can only assume his did too even more in the menu next to the buffet price it said again in big red letter that the crab leg weren t included in the buffet price despite being on the buffet so the guy had no excuse not to know and wa yelling at this woman who barely spoke english she knew enough to be able to do her job but not enough to talk this man down from the ledge all the other server came over to help calm him down but he just couldn t be contained everyone in the dining area wa just staring at him while he threw his tantrum the manager finally came over who barely spoke better english than his staff and the man just kept saying he wa going to call the city and have the place shut down that it false advertisement and he want his entire meal for free i could almost maybe in some distant world see it being justified to have the extra taken off for him and his wife if he truly did somehow miss every single sign saying they weren t included but not his entire meal for free that s absurd so it s clear to me everyone in the dining room and the staff that this guy is just trying his hardest to get a free meal i had just finished eating and when i left he wa still arguing with the manager who did at one point show him every single instance where it wa posted that the crab leg weren t included in the price i wanted to step in so bad but wa afraid to because based on his action and the way his wife looked i guessed he wa an abusive husband she looked terrified just keeping her head down and not saying a word i wish there wa something more i could ve done but i wasn t trying to get my as beat if there s any justice in the world the restaurant didn t cave in and made him pay for his whole meal i left before it wa resolved it honestly felt like one of those what would you do sketch
ftp on mobile let me know if this would belong better somewhere else about a year ago i wa in a pretty bad situation the person who i wa renting from who i had thought wa a generous and kind person had turned out to be slightly unhinged and a bit of a crook i had been dealing with the situation for month and it all came to a head one day in december when she told me that she expected me to pay for expense that i wa in no way responsible for and that if i didn t pay she would sue me this wa her favorite threat she would brag about how many other tenet she had sued and won in the past i wa alone and scared and had no idea what to do i had a graveyard shift that night and after stewing for my entire shift in a fit of desperation i went home and at am packed up my entire life in my car and left after having a couple of breakdown in various parking lot i pulled into a chain hotel near my town s college i had already been turned away from one hotel for not being and i wa running on absolutely no sleep so i wa praying for a chance to get any room anywhere i must ve looked a haggard and exhausted a i felt because a soon a i walked into the lobby the front desk agent wa all warm smile and sympathetic tone i asked for a room and she told me that because it wa so early before check in time i would have to pay full price for a few hour i told her i didn t care that it wa totally fine and that i just needed a room she seemed so worried when she looked at me and said that if i wa able to wait for a bit and come back in a few she could give me an early check in so i wouldn t have to worry about extending that afternoon or having to move room i enthusiastically agreed and a few hour later i wa absolutely comatose in a hotel room surrounded by everything i own and having the best sleep in month i ended up staying in that hotel for around day day more than i could ve afforded if i had been charged for that partial night every single employee at the hotel wa so kind and helpful to me in such a tumultuous time i wa able to collect myself in a safe environment and on the last day of my stay i received a phone call telling me that i had been accepted into an apartment and i moved in that day i am still so grateful for that front desk agent who helped me more than she knew the rest for the hotel employee and for every single one for y all in hospitality

i made a post sometime last week about my concern for one of our new employee a young housekeeper that wa using her employee discount to rent room and had men of different age coming and going at all time during night shift most of your reply urged me to talk to management about her because it seemed obvious that her and her friend were either selling their body or drug i updated the post because the last i heard she didn t show up to work and wa unable to be reached so she wa let go so she didn t work at all while i wa off of work for three day or the other day that last week so she didn t contact u for day or so today while working nd shift she pop in and asks for key to the pool so her and her friend can swim i said that last i heard she didn t work here anymore this made her super pissed getting all huffy sighing and rolling her eye at me she claimed that she worked today in housekeeping and that our manager said it wa okay if they came swimming tonight me that s fine then it won t be a problem when i call gm to confirm that gm didn t answer phone so i messaged her and told the girl i would let them know when she got back to me they stood at the desk just staring at me for a few minute until i told them it may be a few minute so just take a seat and be patient the whole time they waited le than five minute they were shit talking me about how stupid i am i just ignored them year old can be really immature i got a reply from our gm almost instantly after i told them to sit down and wait she said that the housekeeper came in today and apologized for not showing up so our gm gave her a written warning and let her come back to work said it wa okay if they want to use the pool a well i brought up my previous concern about the room rental gm said it won t happen again and that she is a good worker i waited a few more minute and then gave them a key to use the pool no thank you just an ugly sneer from her and her friend amp x b i really really really wish we had some sort of waiting period before employee could use the amenity but whatever thinking about swinging down by the pool in an hour or so to see how many people she sneak in there but at this point i don t know if i should even care anymore clearly my gm doesn t see an issue with her and we are short staffed a it is

please bear with me i am not a server never been i like reading in here since i eat a lot in restaurant and like to try out new place with my so i m from switzerland so i get it in the u you are paid minimum wage a few dollar per hour you make your money from the tip i get that here is the question that i asked myself many time even though i also wa in the u many time for business and ate a lot in restaurant every time i tipped this question popped in my head let s say i am in the u and eating out i order a steak a salad vegetable and a bottle of wine total so i am assumed to tip i guess so the next day i go to the same place again i order a steak with a salad and vegetable but this time i choose a very expensive bottle of wine total now i am assumed to tip like but here is what i don t get the server ha the same effort he need to put in why am i supposed to tip according to the total amount of my meal when most of the time for a simple meal the effort of the server is the same regardless the price i read many time where server rate the tip according to the total amount of their bill i don t want to sound cocky or ignorant i really would like to know is this cultural or is this because if someone eats expensive food he should afford to tip more please note i am not talking about the tip in general i get it that i would like to know the oppinion of the server according to my sample p s oh and why some of the restaurant in the u value the customer so much and offer dicounts if they throw a fit just to have something taken off the bill is someting i don t understand neither make me really feel bad for the server over there but this is a question for another time edit alright thank you for your insight now i got the idea when life brings me again in the u i will make sure to tip at least
when i dine out and use credit i ll zero the tip line and leave a cash tip a friend said oh the server can get in trouble because the manager think server gave bad service i m not advocating breaking the law but the server can claim whatever they want always seems better to get the cash what say you
i ve posted once before about how people just don t seem to understand how deposit work well tonight i had a lady and her sister try to check in these woman are regular by the way and her card wa declined because it wa over the limit she said she didn t have money on there because swore that she didn t know a deposit wa need again this lady wa a regular and she doe in fact know we have a deposit she decided to cancel the reservation and her sister straight up said you and these people are fucking asshole this is absolutely ridiculous and started going on about how she and her sister will never spend her money here again and how it s not right to do this they ll probably be back sometime next week because again we see them all the time but jeez what is it with people and deposit if people weren t asshole in the room we wouldn t be needing these deposit now would we lol edit i forgot to mention that these lady get free night stay because i work in a casino hotel so they get comp from gambling but a deposit is still needed to stay in the room
this is a short one folk but probably one of my most favorite story that ha happened at the hotel i m currently at there wa a group in house for some work related meeting in the middle of the summer one of the group member got a room for herself and a separate room next to hers for her teenage son who had com with her she wa a reward member so both room under her name qualified for free wifi well some device occasionally have problem connecting so this lady and her son stop by the front desk and ask for my help connecting the son s phone the son had accessed the guest network put in the last name and room number and clicked connect but it wouldn t load the homepage after that the usual trick we use when this happens is to just open the browser and go to any website that isn t whatever homepage they have cnn s website google etc the son hand me his phone i open his browser i tap the browser bar and down drop the list of this kid s most visited website i tell you folk i don t think i ve seen a list of adult website that long in my life my immediate reaction wa jumping back and forth between stating loudly wow kid this is a lot of adult content here and informing the kid about private browsing and deleting browser history thankfully sense won out and i did neither of those thing and just got the kid connected but i gave him a knowing look and a nod a i handed it back to him with the knowledge of what he wa going to be spending his time doing while his mom wa in her business meeting

this happened tonight to my coworker so i work at a very popular seafood restaurant that becomes ridiculously busy on valentine s day our restaurant is quite small compared to the other restaurant in the chain therefore thing are smushed there s no waiting area people are literally crowding the entire front of the restaurant and bar so you can t even go up there anyways my coworker walk out of our kitchen and right in front of her is one of her table and the lady is on one knee proposing to her boyfriend right in front of the door she continues to give him a speech for ish minute until my coworker ha to tell her she need to move because everyone is carrying heavy tray right out that door and won t see her the lady proceeded to cry and claim that my coworker ruined her proposal my coworker went back to check on them since it wa her table and the lady wa still cry my coworker then cried in the kitchen because she felt bad then felt even worse when they requested a new server i love valentine s day
so this is actually the second time that this ha happened within the past year a young woman arrived to check in and give me her last name her reservation is nowhere in the system i ask her if it could possibly be under another name to which she replied no i m traveling alone okay so i search for it under her first name nothing i search under the previous date and next day s date still nothing i pull a report that list all arrival for the next week nada i explain to her that her reservation doesn t appear to be anywhere in our system and ask her of she is sure she s at the right property she then proceeds to show me the reservation she made through crappedia and yes the date is right the property is ours but obviously crappedia failed to follow through with actually making the reservation the guest is understandably upset but all i can really do at this point is offer her a room at our walk in rate which is about three time what she had already paid you know who i wa able to come down a little but not nearly enough to where it would be an acceptable offer eventually she decides to leave and i tell her to please return if she change her mind a few minute later i get a call from crappedia crappedia guy asks for my email address so he can send me something to confirm our acceptance of relocation fee since i could not accommodate our mutual guest i explain what actually happened keeping it short and sweet and then i disconnect the call i forward the email to our controller and our gm and the next morning we all had a good laugh over it no crappedia we re not going to pay you for the mistake you made try again a i m sure you will
my first problem is that i m not allowed to take time off i have to have someone cover my shift no matter how many week or month in advance i ask off for we have only bussers only two work on friday s and saturday s and on weekday and sunday i get paid of the server tip split with the host and other bussers one server will pull in sometimes on a single day including the tip out already taken out i work on table with only one other busser on a busy night i feel like i don t get paid enough and not being able to take time off hasn t really struck a nerve in me what do y all think
i had a short shift today and i couldn t motivate myself to get ready for work i live five minute away and i wa almost late because i couldn t get myself together my kid wa almost late to school for the same reason so i get to work and find out i have an top at it wouldn t be so bad but it s a day where we give stuff away with the meal so that on top of separate check and the given away that aren t tipped on well it make monday suck the worst part is i m barely keeping my head above water this week because my depression is ugly so ugly right now most of u at my restaurant have mental health issue i wonder if it the industry just lends to that or are we drawn to the industry are we all fighting depression and just award winning actor so my big party food come up and there isn t a single soul around to follow me with a tray we only had one manager in the building two cook and server that s it and i literally lose my mind i have a two minute complete meltdown and then get it back together and get my party taken care of in the meantime i have this booth of two people i m guessing early s they were really nice and i snuck their order in before my party so they didn t have to wait behind it they also saw how i wa being treated by my big party i went to grab them their free stuff and under their coffee pot i see a tip their tab wa maybe so then i m in the back bawling a i m cutting fruit because i m tired and sad and hate my life today and yet people are still so good that party might have ran my as off and been rude but those two people more than made up for it that being said if you re struggling with your mental health right now talk to someone talk to me do something for yourself to fight the darkness don t quit fighting the darkness thank you couple at table you helped me fight the darkness today
got two recent negative review today complaining about rude server and how we were unhelpful because the server who helped them told them that they cannot switch our ramen broth from pork to anything else like beef or chicken because we literally don t have any other type of broth besides pork we literally don t have beef broth or chicken broth anywhere in the restaurant we specialize in hakata style ramen called such because this ramen style originated from the city of hakata in fukuoka prefecture japan the defining characteristic of hakata style ramen is that it us thin straight noodle instead of the curly type so that it soak up the soup via capillary action hence why if you ve ever had hakata style ramen and you don t eat it fast enough you often end up with more noodle and le or no soup because all the soup ha been sucked up into the noodle which is traditionally a tonkotsu ramen i stopped by once to ask if they had any question and the girl asked me if she didn t want pork could she get beef instead and i told her that yeah but it wouldn t be a straight substitution we would still have to upcharge her for the beef because it cost more than the chashu that we put in our ramen and that while she can substitute the meat the broth would remain pork they were actually in my section but the other server wa adamant on helping them since his section wa pretty dead which i wa fine with and plus it wa almost time for me to clock out anyway since i had only minute left before my shift wa supposed to end and in their star yelp review they mentioned getting udon instead but how the broth wa pork except our udon broth is fish based it even say so right there in the menu that our udon broth is fish based the reason the server who helped you two never said the udon broth wa pork broth is because it wasn t even pork broth to begin with gah and if they didn t like the server who took their order why pluralize server they also complain that server pressure you to order when you have a lot of question excuse me i never pressure anyone to order if they have a lot of question and when i answered the question from the girl i never pressured her to order either since after she said hmm ok in response to my answer i walked away to let her peruse the menu a bit longer
so this story popped up into my head today it s an oldie but a goodie from the first hotel i worked at and i promise it s all true and it s not what you re thinking i used to work at a frampton inn with suite in my hometown which is basically an overgrown desert populated with retiree it wa summer time and a woman and her two kid were in town to visit their grandparent however the kid were eager to use our outdoor pool and persuaded their mom into taking a dip before they went to visit so there the three of them were in their pool attire attempting not to burn their foot a they tried to figure out how to open the pool door it wa unlocked but sometimes needed a good push seeing them struggle from the front desk i called over to my manager to let her know i wa going outside to help our guest get into the pool area and swiftly left while she covered me i apologized for the inconvenience the door had caused the woman and helped her and her kid in we stood around for a moment or two exchanging pleasantry and discussing the reason for their travel when one of her kid shout out hey lady there s a lizard in the pool so she and i go over to investigate and sure enough there wa a lizard about inch long from nose to tail lying on it back on the third step seeing that the kid were kind of upset and unsure of what to do we encouraged one of them to scoop it up for u because it s a dead lizard in the pool and the younger one wa a little freaked out at this point the older one wa hesitant at first but i promised it wouldn t bite him if that s what he wa worried about i mean it looked dead and immobile which seemed to be enough for him to gather his courage and get it afterwards he passed it over to me where it rolled limply into the palm of my hand now all of u were gathered around this poor lizard which wa blue cold and for all intent and purpose wa dead seeing that the kid were upset over it lifelessness i attempted to revive it i covered it with my hand in hope of warming it up no dice we walked it over to a sunnier spot in hope that would warm it up or wake it up nope and that s when it hit me chest compression i looked at the lady and half jokingly said that i wa going to give it cpr so i rolled it over onto it back placed my index finger between it abdomen and chest and gave it a couple little push seriously you guy i wasn t expecting anything but i kid you not that damn lizard s eye and mouth opened wide and a spurt of water shot out the mom and i stood there with our mouth open in disbelief while the kid jumped up excitedly i had somehow managed to bring it back to life we stood like that for another couple second unsure of what to do while the little creature continued to breath in my hand and it naturally brown color started to return the mom and i now laughing over the whole thing decided it wa best to return it to it natural habitat so i looked at the kid and told them i wa going to place it on a rock in the planter area on the outskirt of the pool in hope it could recover and warm up in the sun the younger one said don t worry lady we ll make sure he doesn t get back in the pool and with that i snapped a quick picture of it and returned to the front desk where i relayed the event to my manager if it weren t for the fact that the kid came back in to tell me it ran off into the bush i don t think she would ve believed me oh and i also gave them each a small bag of toffee from our loyalty box a a reward for helping me save the lizard good deed don t go unrewarded when i m working
i love serving it ha been the most fun crazy and physically demanding job besides landscaping that i ve ever had it make an abnormal psych class look like a walk in the park but i love it and i ll tell you why some day when everything go well you hit that point in the day where there is a happy hum of diner dining server serving and everyone is grooving along in their respective role and it becomes a palpable contentment you just know everything is perfect it it s crazy imperfection that is gold right there there are also those diner that are just so nice and kind of great that make you feel good about life and have faith in humanity again that i don t even care if they tip they just brighten my day but then they do so bonus then there are the cute little kiddos that come in and are sweet a effin pie polite precocious and shy ordering their own food with a little pwease at the end they just make my heart melt especially when they get to sign the check too or they scribble an illegible note on the receipt on the whole people are weird and messed up and some of them are just down right karen who will get their karmic comeuppance in a big way but there are a lot of beautiful sweet people out there that will make your day just by being them and vice versa i always walk away from those interaction feeling happy and grateful to be doing what i do liking the beautiful weirdo i work with help too
so i have worked at a shitty motel for almost year now the manager ha always been a nightmare but being handicapped it is difficult for me to find other employment i have finally found job i can do to replace this one i graduated college so i m still applying for job in my field these are just a few example but since i started there my manager ha treated employee she didn t like badly enough that they would quit because firing someone take too much paperwork been openly and subtly racist told employee to clock out and keep working if they didn t get everything done within their shift allowed employee she like to be openly racist and refuse guest due to their name and how they look when my father in law passed away suddenly she texted me at least once a day while i wa gone to tell me how inconvenient it wa that i wasn t at work one coworker worked here for several year when she put in her two week notice the manager talked shit about her daily not only that but the manager told her not to come in for her last day and then told other employee and guest that she just didn t show up for her shift she also told me that she would specifically give that employee a bad reference when future employer called her it s a right to work state that employee wasn t even required to give notice she could have just quit and left yes i warned that employee about what the manager said she ha left managerial task for me to do and being in a position where i couldn t afford to lose my job i did them even though i m paid way too little allowed the maintenance guy to be verbally abusive to employee because i can t replace him nobody else know a much about pool a him yes that is a quote allowed employee to make massive mistake and then let them leave those mistake for me to fix usually all it take is a quick chat with tech support but those employee refuse to fix their own mistake and the manager allows it there is nonstop gossip and drama the manager talk about every employee behind their back nearly all of it lie and she encourages gossip and drama between employee she share personal information about employee with regular guest and gossip about everything and everyone she try to dictate people s life outside of work she told one employee when she wa allowed to have her hip replacement surgery after bitching the whole time while that employee wa gone for surgery she then told that employee that she wa never allowing her to have surgery again b along with that she tell people not to leave town on their day off if she is out of town just in case anything happens c she left town when there wa only people able to work the front desk and then rolled her car inconvenient i know when one employee wa out for surgery another employee scheduled her surgery at the same time that left front desk employee me and housekeeper who kinda know how to work front desk b i wa hired for part time because i m handicapped and yet instead of picking up some slack herself because she chose not to hire anyone in the interim i wa scheduled day in a row since employee were out for surgery but no overtime because she specifically scheduled it so that day were on one week and the other were on another week we get paid physical check that we have to pick up at the front desk at noon on payday friday everyone s is available unless that person got fired or quit in that case their check is locked in a safe that only my manager can get into that way the person is forced to talk to her she withholds paycheck to be petty if that person come to get their check after she s gone for the day they have to wait until monday to get paid that is highly illegal and i have told people that but they re too scared of my manager to do anything about it now i tried for day to come in when she wa here to give my week notice because i knew that if i just left a note or email she would talk shit about how i wa too chicken to quit to her face but every time i came she wa gone i finally got fed up and left a note and an email for proof that i did give notice that wa yesterday my manager is already spreading lie about how i gave notice and what i said in my notice the note and the email said mostly the exact same thing a you know i came in today to give you my notice january st is my last day of work at the along with my verbal notice i wanted to provide written notice a well regard there are more day that i ll be working in my last week she s going to do her best to make my life a living hell and who know what she ll do after that what would you do in my shoe

tonight we were already slammed and understaffed when a group of showed up at the bar i usually memorize my order but they said they were getting eight drink at once so i said let me write this down so you get everything you need a few of the guy ordered directly but then the woman in their party told them she d get their drink she gave me an order for seven cocktail and i asked if that wa all i read back her order and asked if that wa one drink for everyone in her party and she said yes i took her card and saw it wa a company card for a pretty big tech company in town and thought yay always glad to have cool clientele the bartender cranked out their drink and i brought them over when i went back to check on them one of the men said is our other old fashioned coming i looked at the woman perplexed because she had clearly only ordered one in the universal symbol for i fucked up please help she widened her eye and said yes right because i ordered two and i realized she wa probably out with her team and fucked up the order and didn t want to look like an asshole so they left thinking we are a shitty bar which we re not hope it wa worth it lady
i only worked at one restaurant that had a secret menu it wa a local chinese restaurant our american chinese menu and traditional chinese menu were on separate sheet of paper before they were printed in a book the owner just told u not to hand the traditional chinese menu to white people unless asked this wa pretty racist so i just handed both menu to everyone technically it wasn t a secret but we did have a reporter from a popular local newspaper come in the writer most likely aren t asian so they had to ask for our traditional chinese menu the article referred to it a our secret menu and everyone came in asking for it other than that i m pretty convinced that most secret menu item just mean one customer asked for hella modification that one time and made a ridiculous name for it edit proofreading

my boyfriend and i both work the front desk at two different hotel we took a mini vacation to orlando for the weekend to visit a theme park and stayed at a beautiful resort he got a great employee rate at one night we re dining by the pool and there are a few kid swimming and playing in the area then from around the corner we see a few duck waddle our way likely trying to grab a bite of our meal our waiter groan a this is a likely scenario for him while i resist the urge to feed the little dude all of the sudden i hear the unmistakable shrieking of wild eleven year old duck duck duck they screech while chasing after the poor thing the duck being completely startled jump into the pool to escape the kid jump in after them and for the next few minute i watch in disgust a these kid go from one end of the pool to the other chasing after splashing and tormenting the poor thing i thought surely a parent would say something but nope maybe the staff too busy with other guest when i heard one of the hell spawn scream block them they re trying to jump out of the pool i d had enough i got up and walked to the edge of the pool and shouted girl girl stop torturing those animal they are clearly trying to get away from you they kind of blankly stared at me probably embarrassed and immediately let the duck escape into the bush i went back to my meal and they continued to hang out for a few minute before moving on in the direction of another pool hopefully they didn t encounter any other small animal along their way

our urinal wa out for about hour last week and in that time different time we had to change the sign because grown as men kept peeing on it three time all within hour we had a wet floor sign in front of it and a sign directly over it the worst part wa it just pooled in the bowl because it wa broken so the whole bathroom stank after the rd time we had to put a trash bag over the entire urinal absolutely ridiculous and i know it wasnt child because it wa in the middle of the week so most of our guest were corporate traveler
to be fair it wa justified happened the other day our ays lady who is like a mother to me know the very basic of her job she can answer most question but some are more complex whenever she doesn t know the answer she ll ask someone who can she come to desk to ask me and say this person on the phone is being super rude of course i think it s the guest i tell her to transfer the call to me it s the third party rep the issue wa that the final price on the guest s confirmation had changed ok fair enough i would call about that too we charge a resort fee and it s been an ever loving nightmare since we implemented it last summer to make thing worse it s one lower more reasonable price now and increasing by in a couple of month when we re getting into our busy season when the guest booked it said she d have the lower resort fee somewhere in between booking the re a couple of week ago and now she learned that we were charging the higher fee depending on when they booked we may honor the lower fee like i said a nightmare anyway third party rep kept cutting me off and not accepting what i wa telling her after doing the appropriate math the final balance wa what the guest wa told it would be when she booked she kept saying thing like why is it different that s not what i m asking etc just pretty nasty for the most part i let it go but by the end i had had it we were wrapping up the conversation and i say do you have a supervisor i could speak with her no ma am i m sorry me even a trainer anyone above you would be fine her no ma am we don t have the ability to do a three way call me ok well in that case i m really not in the habit of telling people how to do their job but you really need some additional training on how to speak to people who are only trying to help you her ok and your last initial for my record i tell her to have a nice day and we hang up the guest called right after and could not have been nicer she said she s just been getting the runaround and wa very confused about everything i explained everything to her a clearly a i could and told her to call u directly with any further question or concern third party are trash
i work at an international hotel chain at a location in canada because it s canada our winter is filled with hockey tournament every weekend those who have had to deal with this before will know what i m talking about but i will give a short run down of what a typical hockey tournament is like for those in warmer climate hockey team always show up hour before check in time and throw a fit when their room aren t ready they throw a fit if we offer them room that are ready immediately but aren t with the rest of their group when they finally do get a room it s always trashed during their stay the adult always party and ignore their kid they get drunk and hang out in the hall and completely ignore their kid who are running around and screaming and causing havoc because of this our hotel ha hired security for every tournament to help with crowd control and to enforce our hotel rule our hotel rule are pretty basic don t hang out in the hall because it s a fire evacuation hazard and it s annoying to non hockey guest don t drink in public space a we do not have the appropriate license for it don t play hockey in the hall quite time is at pm simple enough apparently not i m currently spending my morning enraged a i read the survey result we got from last weekend some of my least favourite include we were made to sign an agreement not to play hockey in the hall at check in why would you allow a kid hockey tournament stay with you if you didn t want to deal with them the other kid from my hockey team kept screaming in the hall all night and the hotel staff didn t stop them when we showed up our room wasn t ready and we had to wait two hour for our room you know we are coming so why didn t you have room ready early edit i ve been to prison with le security edit is it so hard to have a space for the parent from this team to hang out that isn t the lobby we just want to have a drink and have fun but security wouldn t let u we do offer space but it s per day plus if you want to have alcohol you need to get a permit so you re welcome to do that if you pay for it we don t offer free meeting space to you and your friend

there s a regular at my restaurant who is always very grumpy with server but love to talk to the cook i don t have much proof but i think it s a gender thing since most of the cook are male and most server female normally on the hour i work there s only one maybe server scheduled yesterday i happened to be the only on on schedule it wa fairly busy so when i got a chance to smoke i took it and immediately a car pulled in so i snubbed my cigarette and went inside to take their order once they were gone i tried again only for the same thing to happen not a huge deal people eat when they eat and they were all super nice and neither table stiffed on the tip they leave i try for the third time i lit my cigarette and took about puff when regular walked around the corner of the building scowling taking a break are ya he said kind of aggressively i smiled said yes but i m on my way in so i can get him set up i walk in in front of him wash my hand and get his order he is very curt but that s nothing new when his food is done he called the cook over to talk to him immediately he start talking about how lazy the server here are because every time he come in one is outside smoking so bitterly i slipped on my jacket and asked the cook if he could manage while i go finish my cigarette cook is great said yes my tip wa getting to smoke a whole cigarette
our worst regular were old lady who ordered very little drank only water tipped very little stayed for way too long they insulted the female server more than the guy but we all hated them i saw them pull in and park illegally in a triangular area painted with the diagonal stripe that wa tight between the last legal spot and a low retaining wall the only reason they fit wa because the car in the spot next to it wa a small door when they re seated they tell me they are in a hurry because they re going to a show no problem i d like them gone asap anyway midway through their meal everything wa going a usual and i see through the window that the car next to them wa leaving suddenly i have a wonderful terrible idea i asked one of our dishies to move his huge beat up king cab pickup into the open spot and be sure to block in the other car done and done and once he parked it there wa like inch between them but the pickup wa legally parked they finish pay tip their usual and head out i can see them stop in their track walk around their car like there s some magical way to extract it then storm back in the next few minute went just a you d expect they re yelling and screaming my manager is asking them what do you want me to do you parked illegally it s a busy shopping area i can t move the truck it could belong to anyone in a block radius now they re yelling from the hostess station to see if anyone in the place owns the truck no response i suggest they they should call an uber or taxi but they don t have uber and don t want to spend the money on a taxi after about minute someone come and pick them up i m pretty sure they missed their show once they were gone we moved the truck and yes they left a shitty review on yelp that service wa so slow we made them miss their show they were half right
so despite having nearly two year experience in the industry and currently working at a hotel that accepts cash payment for room with a deposit i m not used to denying entry to walk in in fact tonight wa one of the only time i ve done so it wa shortly after i started working at about and i had just finished my beginning of the night task i wa sitting there at my computer relaxing when a car pulled up for some reason people like to pull up past my entrance which annoys me though i can at least see the car through the reflection in the window a few second later a guy walk in something about him seems very seedy a if he s covered in red flag he wa bald with a bandanna around the top of his head and his face wa covered in tattoo the only one i remember were the rune which wa interesting okay i respect people for their lifestyle choice though not many place would hire people with that many tattoo on he also smelled of tobacco smoke pretty much immediately i didn t want to rent a room to him but i wa willing to give him the benefit of the doubt hopefully he didn t give off too many red flag me smiling with a chipper voice good evening you have a reservation walk in hi i wa looking to rent a room me okay you want one bed or two i started looking up the room price walk in just one is fine hey so most of the night is already over could i get a room through tomorrow night and only have to pay for tomorrow night need i remind you it wa only about the guy just handed me another red flag me the smile fading unfortunately i can t really do that walk in you didn t run the audit yet did you when do you do that i can come back then me i run it at about am keep in mind if you check in before am there s a early check in fee walk in okay i ll come in then then he left at that point i hoped he would find another hotel to stay at keep in mind what i said at the beginning about how i don t really like telling people they can t stay at my hotel i know some people lie and say they re sold out i don t like doing that unfortunately it make me really uncomfortable time passed and i hoped he wouldn t show up ala that wa not to be shortly after my audit is done and i m doing my post audit work just room rack for housekeeping lo and behold i see a familiar car that i hoped wasn t his he walk in walk in pulling out a huge wad of cash big red flag so the total will be about me lying despite not wanting to unfortunately at this time of night we have to take credit card walk in so if i just go and put this on a card you ll take it me feeling very uncomfortable i guess he got an irritated expression on his face walk in you just don t want me staying here don t you he started to leave what s your manager s name again i felt even more uncomfortable but i tell it to him he walked out and drove off leaving my hotel behind to be honest i probably didn t handle it particularly well and the guy s probably going to complain to my bos oh well he wa waving red flag anyway particularly the part about wanting to stay the first night for free someone else tried that before i didn t budge waiting four hour for a room despite there being numerous other hotel in my area wa he kicked out of all the other hotel wanting to pay in cash and having a huge wad of it and smelling of smoke the face covered in tattoo wa only a start i wouldn t be surprised if he wa a local too which would have been yet another red flag hopefully i don t get downvoted too much for this
i think the photo pretty much speaks for itself edit new image host link http ibb co lqj qmt our po is set up so that you can ring in open item and the price can be anything but zero sometimes when the bar is busy it s a bad idea to call for a taster better to send a ticket so i send through a ticket and charge one cent but of course one time someone had to take issue with that one fucking penny and even if she tried to argue the principle of it a taster is at least an ounce of beer oz to a pint that taster is worth at least cent some people man and of course i would have offered an apology explaination refund ha if she had actually said something instead of leaving a passive agressive note threatening to not come back

got a question for any server in the dc area but in bigger city in general my wife and i are born and raised in indiana about a decade ago we took a trip out to dc to visit a friend who we went to school with and met her and some of her work friend at this little place for a beer and pizza happy hour i can t remember the place s name we ate and drank and our server dropped off the check our friend and her companion then threw all their card in a pile and took out a pen they wrote the last digit of each their card on the bill and the amount they owed and explained this is how we do it out here when i asked why didn t they just have the server split the check so we went with it looking back on it this just seems like such a pain in the as for the server even in indiana back then we had po system that made splitting a check only a couple of button push this wasn t a written check it wa printed i ve been in this industry for a while and never had anyone split a check this way with me but i don t think i d appreciate it and it d actually be more work for me my question is do people really do that often in bigger city it seems dumb and overly obsequious like we don t wanna disturb the great and powerful server at this not at all fancy bar and make her do a little bit of extra work that s well within her job description

here s what we get to deal with at my job people coming into the kitchen even though we don t have a sign a i said we oddly need one now it should be clear that a kitchen is meant for just employee adult customer will often pop their head into the back to ask for more ranch ya know instead of waiting for a server to pas by because they need that ranch now they didn t need it when the server asked two minute ago if they needed anything else but this is mild adult sometimes also like to enter through the walkway of the bar and the open kitchen to try and pay their server did you know that if you re too anxious to wait for the server to come by and cash you out that waiting in front of the cash register will not piss them off when they cash you out and the kid we have some reckless parent so many time have i watched a manager tackle a kid that is literally hanging out by the oven today a top came in with relentless crotch goblin the whole time we were shooing kid out of the kitchen while the parent were just chilling and drinking there were teen parent present who especially had the worst kid at one point my friend had to pick up one of the child of those young parent and sit him down at the table at another moment the kid bump into me while i m making a drink at the bar and the mom is chasing him laughing exclaiming oh get back here hahaha you re so silly lt okay you know this is the point where you actually parent don t go back to the table to give him more money for game and let him do this three more time suffice to say i m going to start keeping spare condom in my server book
i ve used this many time because i don t want to sound accusatory in basically saying we need a card on file in case you trash the place or steal but this wa the first time the guest liked it so much during check in a dad asked what the incidental were for in a joking way i think so i said oh in case you decide to flood the place or sneak in a llama or something the young teen in particular found this really funny she kept the joke going a bit saying something about leaving the llama in the car the mom got in on it too adding something about a penguin in a cooler i don t remember specifically how the penguin came up since i wa more focused on getting them checked in properly anyway it felt good to get such a positive reaction to that silly thing i say do y all have any little joke you sneak into the patter at the front desk i m still pretty new so i might borrow it if so
we were doing some renovation on our top floor one morning one of the worker got jumped outside of the hotel and stabbed quite a few time with a machete he somehow survived the cop wanted to see if anyone had seen or heard anything and knocked on door of the guest with view of the street this couple sends u an email a week later asking for compensation due to the fact that something happened and a cop woke u up even though we had the do not disturb sign up why can t the front desk people just call u and see if we are up and inform all guest of what is going on at my location we work alone during the night this happened about min before the day shift who also usually work alone wa supposed to start their shift how in the world is one person supposed to talk to the cop give them hot water to clean the entrance street calm guest that saw it happen and at the same time call each one of the room we had occupied that night this is so tragically funny though
this happened a few hour ago it s christmas eve and i m one of the lucky one to be off work today christmas day and the day after i came to work anyways in my defense i use the hotel s gym after hour and thought i had left my earbuds in the locker room so i showed up to look for them i came in wearing street clothes and made it clear to my front desk agent that i m not on the clock i m not going to be on the clock do not send any upset guest to me to talk to because i cannot speak to them on the phone or in person i m an hourly paid supervisor she get an upset guest on the phone and sends them back to me anyways said she couldn t handle her mind you my desk agent is a yr old woman who ha no patience for anyone and their b s especially on christmas she ha in the past transferred people to our manager s voicemail purely out of spite for the guest and their bad attitude i let it go and just answer the phone me thank you for holding this is op how may i assist you guest yeah hi listen i m very upset about our stay with you all it s christmas and this shouldn t be happening me i do apologize for the upset ma am what seems to be the problem guest the problem is that your hotel doesn t clean it s room properly i have hive all over me from the amount of dust in that room i have severe allergy i m allergic to feather and dust and pet and this went on for a while this woman would not stop complaining about her allergy and how when she woke up this morning she had hive all over her body what she s saying is that she reacted to the dust in the room what she s describing is something else she s reacting to the bedsheets some people are allergic to different chemical or brand of detergent that s not our problem that s yours talk to your doctor about it i have pollen allergy you don t see me screaming at a flower that i want a refund because claritin doesn t always work but of course you can t tell a guest that so while she s ranting my manager walk in the door she saw that i wa on the phone with a guest in my street clothes and just made a face i didn t have to explain she kinda figured it out already and wasn t ok with it i apologize to the guest explain that my manager just walked in and would be looking into the matter a i wa about to leave the office for the holiday then got a contact number and explained this all to my manager my manager sighed groaned slumped in her chair rubbed her temple then looked over the reservation manager f ck this lady this woman wa not a reward member booked with a rd party wa staying for day in a high floor feather free cleaned the morning she checked in and had stayed with u before in the past complaining that entire stay a well about thing that were a her problem not an u problem my manager didn t call her back she wa genuinely busy with a ton of other thing going on instead hour later the guest called u back yes i wa still there for some reason the guest wa furious she didn t call back this time however my manager answered and stayed on the phone with her my manager is not in the mood for this mess especially at christmas so she just let the guest rant and rave all the while my manager throw in the occasional uh huh or oh gosh for dramatic effect then offer the guest an upgrade to a suite and the guest is instantly ok with everything my manager walked into the back office where i wa gathering my thing look at me with the most i hate life look ever and say i wish to f cking god that i had a bucket of dust to toss around that lady s new room i tried to offer that we had a few bag of fake snow lying around from decorating and we could just toss that all over the room instead but she didn t go for it i did get her to smile though merry christmas happy holiday and happy new year everyone i hope it wa a good year for you all

i just had a lady treat me like property demanding she get her car now our valet is rd party all i could do is call them the same a her she really made me feel like garbage it suck having to just take this rich as bougie lady screaming at me like a toddler so i can keep this job sometimes this job really take a bite out of my soul
guy come in for his reservation paid for by his bos with an authorization form he give me his id a consular id from guatamala only it s not in a single card it s two loose plastic sheet and the paper form in between them interestingly and alarmingly enough all of the pertinent information like the photo date of birth name and id number are on the plastic with the paper insert being a blank id worse these sheet were dirty a hell on both side making information like the expiration date unreadable he asks me a best he could why i can t take the id and i struggle to explain to him that the id is broken it s not valid he spends a couple minute trying to reach his bos before going to his car and getting his passport that wa perfectly fine i laughed and told him next time lead with this but you need to have your id replaced
so i ve worked at hotel for year now and i m always baffled on how management will change thing policy that end up pissing off our guest my complaint today is that i just kind of realized that we took our previously complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste and are now charging guest each for them they are about the same quality a our before complimentary toothbrush and instead of our mini single use packet we now have a travel sized toothpaste i m just confused why when we were before throwing people a bone we are now trying to profit off of it oh you need to brush your teeth because who like going to bed starting off your day with rancid as breath that will be dollar i ve also worked at a milton where we went from giving all the honor member bottle of water for free to then only charging the lowest tier member blue per bottle way to go milton a big company feeding off of the people that don t give you enough money you have to charge them for water i m just mad confused since they are the lowest tier and you would you know want them to move up aka stay at your hotel more so why are you taxing them on water when you can simply give it to them for free making them happy and then staying at the hotel more idk maybe i m crazy
i get it s january and that saving money is important but a month no shift it could even be longer than a month considering i m on a hour contract and they need to save money i get it but we have like other member of staff and the owner seem to be letting the younger therefore cheaper staff do the work and i literally won t have a pay check this month i just hope i have some luck and find another job
sorry for any formatting i m on mobile i work front desk concierge at a luxury hotel in a small city that generally attracts a lot of wealthy traveler we regularly host golf event medium conference etc so one weekend our manager tell u we have a big fish coming in so be on your best behavior he then showed u the man s net worth which topped out closer to billion than not i wa interested i ve never met or even seen a multi billionaire i wa then very surprised to see that he wa in a main floor basic king room with a custom rate halfway through his stay he asked about his room rate shook his head and had u move him to an even lower class of room to save some money of course we accommodated him and gave him a custom rate that even our long time guest rarely see after he had haggled and bitched about the cost i looked his wealth source up and it wa from subprime loan and gouging student loan payment if the other staff had known which is almost all local college folk he probably would have gotten the worst service in the place money talk but he wasn t tipping and half of them have loan that he probably had his dirty hand in anyway moral of the story if you re insanely rich it wasn t from haggling over dollar on a hotel room and it wasn t from shorting bellstaff when they bend over backwards helping you so spread the love
so i work for a place that s a cafe during the day and a nightclub at night it s an adventure and i love every minute of it sunday s are insane usually the saturday night close is rough but i ve learned to expect that and i won t speak badly about those that served until am and just were too tired to restock some napkin i get it dude sunday is also walk in top day it never fails we get large group back to back we had a person table come in and my coworker sam name changed had it put in his section and it took up every table he wa assigned sam is a great server he s been in the industry for year and know his stuff he wa attentive constantly giving refill making them laugh etc a thing come to an end people began leaving so sam asked if the check wa all on one everyone at his table just looked around at each other and it wa obvious that they had not planned out whether one person wa footing the bill or if everyone wa going separate half the table had left at this point so one of the older gentleman said i guess it s on one sam took him the bill and after they cashed out they quickly left this table left him on a check sam wa devastated they had been there through the entire lunch rush so he missed out on a lot of turn around that made the rest of u some really good money he told me that he wa counting on today so that he could make his rent and now he wasn t sure what to do he wa going to ask to work a double after already working a double the day prior side note i get that people should manage money accordingly but i don t know his personal life and some of u to live day by day i wa there recently i get it zero judgement i felt so bad for him that i printed off another copy of the check and put into a book with it and stacked it into some book by the register i pretended that i had lost a signed receipt and wa going through them next to him i casually opened the one with his name in it and said sam you left money in here you idiot and handed it to him i pretended to find mine and casually walked away he came up to me and said that he wa super confused because he had only had one book at the table but now there wa this one i just looked at him and said some thing aren t worth investigating i m telling this story because i want everyone to know that there are good people in the world we all will get that shitty table or karen s or a bad night but i m always looking out for my coworkers i m a strong believer in treat the way that you want to be treated and i m hoping my message will inspire others to offer to do a little extra side work or bring in some snack to share during the rush little thing go a long fucking way in this rough business we are server not servant this isn t slavery with extra step
the following just took place i had to type up an narrative to convey my side of the story since i am off tomorrow mr x guest y agm z chef mr x came to the front desk and approached me for a replacement key to his room because his wasn t working following standard security protocol i asked him very politely if i could quickly see his id to confirm that he did indeed have access to the room mr x did not like the fact that i wa asking him for his id and became very hostile right away said that he wa in the gym and didn t have his id he wa swearing at me saying how this isn t right and he shouldn t have to verify his identity for a new key that i should know who he is to be honest it s just another face out of the hundred i see a day i only specifically remember you if you give me a reason to good or bad i informed mr x that i would have to follow him up to his room so i could take a quick look at his id give him the replacement key and everything would be good to go take just a minute or two he then became even more irate and said that he wa calling corporate and going to sue me for not giving him the key to his room i informed him that this wa for his protection including mine i just can t go issuing key card to anyone who request one without verifying who they are called y to verify and he told me the same thing i also gave y s card to him knowing he will want to follow up i then asked for z to join me to follow mr x to his room just for my protection the entire way mr x wa being irate and very confrontational i informed him politely that he needed to calm down it would enable me to assist him better i informed him that the threat he wa making at the desk and on the way to the room were uncalled for that if we had any further issue out of him he will be asked to leave he then informed me that i am not making threat i am making a promise i told him i am making a promise to you a well if we have any further issue you will be asked to leave if you don t leave peacefully i will have you removed by the local pd who z had pre dialed into his phone mr x quickly show me his id i had him the new key and tell him to have a good rest of his evening he then mutter under his breath fuck off fat bitch and slam his door a of pm i have not had any further encounter with him and hope not to again am i in the wrong asking for id to verify he had access to the room i wouldn t want people just handing out key card to anyone and everyone who asked without verification they could then enter your room rob you blind or even worse i wouldn t want anyone doing the same to a room i wa in that s for sure
i work with an older man named bob he s about year old and definitely should be retired at this point our owner hired him because they re best friend for like something year to a host position bob and i are the only two full time host i absolutely hate him and so doe the rest of the staff he is sexist petty throw tantrum and is completely unable to do his job i spend almost all my shift with him fixing his mistake he also can not be fired because he s the owner friend although i absolutely hate him for a multitude of reason too long to list in a single post i m going to post the most recent drama he s caused at work at the very beginning of the day before we open the server polish and stock any remaining silverware from the night before then until close the host are in charge of polishing and restocking the silverware for the server we also use a small supply we keep at the host stand to make individual role of silverware for le formal table at the end of the day after we close any silverware left over is racked and cleaned by the server this is how it ha been done at this restaurant for over a decade no one ha had any problem with this system until bob please also note that the host keep silverware stocked at the actual host stand for the convenience of a certain section so server do not have to walk almost to the back of the restuarant to reset their table bob decides that server are no longer allowed to take silverware from the host stand because he ha decided that would be for silverware role only he promptly tell all the server this which they ignore he also proudly announced that he oh so graciously polished a rack of silverware for the server and had done them a huge favor bob absolutely know this is part of our job description so i have no idea why he said this then a server r kindly brings up a fully racked and cleaned supply of silverware for him to polish and put away bob freak on him telling r to take it back to the kitchen because it s not his job to polish the rack and he s already rolled enough silverware therefore he didn t need more silverware bob also state it s not his job to supply silverware to the server and told r to do it himself r then asked bob if he enjoyed being paid to do nothing among other thing bob went cry off to our gm this man is remember about being picked on and bullied by r and how he s not going to polish the silverware and basically stating he s not going to do his job now we have notice at literally every wait station and kitchen notice board explaining the system of cleaning silverware r wa not written up and everyone got a hearty laugh out of what he had said to bob bob called out today claiming to be sick but we all know he s just sulking if anyone is interested i have probably a hundred story to tell like how he assaulted me how he treat guest and how he pretend to be the owner

i wa working at restaurant that served wing both boneless and bone in sometimes customer would order chicken tender and have them spun in sauce a opposed to the sauce coming on the side to dip in we had just had a meeting during which we got to try new menu item and to discus change one of which being that we would no longer allow customer to order their chicken tender spun in sauce during slow shift when we didn t have a hostess on shift to take to go order whoever got to the phone first both placed the order for the customer and checked them out when they arrived the woman wanted tender spun in sauce and i informed her that we were no longer allowed to place these order and offer alternative she wa rude before i even told her this so i didn t expect her to be easy about it she wasn t and argued that she had always ordered them that way i apologized her and again informed her that the change came from the general manager and i wasn t able to place her order a she wanted it i got tired of arguing with her and told her i would put her on the phone with my manager of course my manager agrees to do it for her and give the phone back to me cool i do what i m told to do and my manager doesn t have my back no surprise there she s even ruder than before and talking down to me even more because her bratty entitled attitude wa rewarded i finished the call and called her a cunt just a moment too soon a the phone hadn t quite made it to the receiver cost me a job i hated but seeing her pissy pinched up face a she approached the building wa worth it

for background i served for two year in my hometown small country town big church crowd and i never received no tip except one time to be fair he wa the groundskeeper at my neighborhood golf course and i told him how i used to sled on the golf course on snow day a a kid groundskeeper don t enjoy that otherwise tip at this mom and pop restaurant were steady then i moved to downtown charleston i wa a server assistant for fine dining and the tip were nice a majority of customer were businessmen paying with a company card who weren t technically paying for the meal so i did great there flash forward to now i m on my third shift at a new place and can t believe how awful i am being tipped my first ever table here left me nothing my service wa completely fine i didn t mess up their order they never needed a refill i wa attentive to them then later that night i got left nothing on a bill it wa my training day so i didn t expect much it sting though when your expected tip is on the receipt doesn t match what you get when you did nothing wrong my next shift of my item sale would have been around yet i only made today same thing happened the area i live in now is low income or college student no matter how broke i am i won t go to a restaurant if i can t tip another thing is because i am new i am not working busy weekend so the advice i am seeking is should i stick it out because this is normal or should i find a job in a better area of town this job is just so convenient right now it a minute walk from my apartment and i d have to take the train to another job is anyone else getting lowballed a lot
yesterday i came in to work to find out a guest had died over nye and it s been really weighing heavily on me ever since of course the detail are vague but they were young and they never woke up that morning everyone speculated that it probably wa alcohol and or drug related i had spoken to the person who d booked the room on the phone and they were so excited to come downtown for new year s eve i can t imagine waking up to find your friend dead i will never look at that room the same again this isn t the first time a guest ha died at a hotel i ve worked at and maybe it s because it s also the start of the new year but i can t seem to shake it off
i work for a taco bar in the midwest it s a small chain that wa recently invested into by a holding company so the company recently ha been making a lot of change that are hostile to the staff our host make and hour bad for the area and get tipped out a small amount by the bar because they bus table when not seating guest taking to go order i found out that just last week corporate mandated that all host are no longer getting tip but told manager not to tell them about the change apparently they were hoping we would still bust our ass bussing table but don t want to tip u for it the same restaurant chain decided that it would no longer be letting server take their tip home at the end of the night they have to submit their tip to the bar and instead receive the tip in their weekly paycheck after being taxed also people order take out a lot at this restaurant but for huge stretch on weekend there will only be one host working so they have to seat the lunch rush by themselves take to go order and bus table if people are nice they will leave a dollar or two for their takeout order but don t usually tip on that corporate said to stop accepting any and all tip for takeout order this isn t normal right it feel like some next level dystopian shit but i m from retail and this is my first job in the industry so i don t have a measure on if this is normal or not
don t get me wrong i always tip when i go out to eat even but i always wondered why doe the food industry have this tipping tradition and not any other industry i know that they work hard but they also get paid the hourly wage plus their tip for example retail worker fast food worker like mcdonald s we all work hard a well and we don t get any tip we just get our hourly wage which is the exact same and btw i live in canada and the server get the same hourly wage a any other minimum wage job
so one day i am working front desk at my hotel mind you shitty hotel so i get a call from a guest you gotta come down here someone is threatening to shoot someone i am thinking well that is the exact reason i should not go there but to be sure i enter the hallway and people in the hallway every guest is there and were like you need to call i m like why didn t you anyways pull out my phone walking to the office how may i direct your emergency i work at shitty hotel apparently one of my guest is threatening to shoot other guest did you see the gun he intends to shoot them with me no i hope not to ok are you sure there is a threat me well apparently at least people witnessed this ok we ll get around to sending a police officer there me thanks minute later a police car show up around the time the guy that is threatening to shoot people happens to be walking to the office police officer talk to this guy i am expecting the police officer to come talk to me next nope he is fine he get in his crown vic and drive off afterwards i call the non emergency line with my manager wtf why didn t your guy even talk to me fine we ll send someone out so when the pd show back up we know this guy is gone give them a room key and all they find is a bb gun we were lucky that is all it is but i feel like the local pd failed u we added him to our do not rent list and that wa it we were right on the line between sheriff and police department calling got the police but technically the sheriff still had jurisdiction awhile later some high ranking member of the sheriff department came to u and asked if we would provide them with a room for them to do surveillance yeah sure this room doesn t have working water but come down here when you need it and so on they gave u their number for when we needed it and it wa faster than and got more result
background i work in a nice steakhouse and valentine is probably our busiest night of the year it is always a nightmare i have probably nightmare story from last night but this one stood out from the rest a busser dropped a plate near some booth and got a broom to clean up the mess in doing so he accidentally touched the foot of a guest with the broom the guy had to have had his leg hanging off the booth a they are elevated off the floor about inch guy freak out and grab the broom out of the busser s hand and start to inspect it the busser is confused and asks the man if everything is alright the man state that it is against his religion for a broom to touch his foot and wa very upset evidently like making a scene upset the server of the table nearly had a meltdown trying to deal with this situation and all his other table manager ended up giving them a free round of drink and a gift card i m very tolerant of people s religion and difference but to behave this way in public and have those type of expectation of restaurant staff is childish working in foodservice and especially on holiday you really see how terrible a lot of people are
my beautiful server of reddit we ve had a bit of an uproar in our restaurant one of our server had a large party of early twenty boy on vacation in our town from new york our server is a lovely bubbly caring adorable little button that i adore with all my heart the boy all saw what i see in her and decided to leave their phone number on their chit sheet every single one of them left their number she felt objectified so one of the other girl on the team took a pic of the sheet and sent them in the work group whatsapp essentially making a joke of the blatant sexual inappropriateness well our manager commented asking if it wa joke we said it wasn t well he decided to send message essentially saying that this server must ve done something inappropriate with the table to elicit such a reaction a you can guess all hell ha broken loose every single female employee ha sent him a message essentially saying what the fuck how are you blaming your server for this we a woman deal with shit like this on the regular and you re blaming u for it what the fucking fuck well i realized how the hell is our manager supposed to know these thing if we never tell him if we suffer with this in silence how is he supposed to help it also became very clear that alot of our female team member don t know how to rebuke these advance with out submitting or just being silent they don t have the tool to cordially let someone know that wa inappropriate without escalating the situation and having a guest become angry with them so lady of reddit what are some way you ve found to deal with these situation in a professional and cordial way if a guy asks if you have a bf or for your number what do you say if they touch inappropriately what do you do what are thing management ha done to back you it s very clear my team need help i m hoping you can be a good resource for u thank you in advance
when you ve had drink in a row you need water i m sorry if you think your tolerance is so amazing that you literally don t need to take a single sip of h o throughout the evening but you need water oh you think i m drunk or something no you re dehydrated and your probably gonna ask me for water within the next min anyway why do you think not drinking water mean you have a better tolerance it s not a bad thing to need water it s normal you dumb fuck it s definitely a pride thing but that doesn t even make any sense what is so offensive so often i have people get mad at me and then not touch their water after gurgling down double mixed drink i might a well throw the water in your face with how offended some people get like christ
update employee ha been let go she didn t show up to work today and our gm saw her walking around downtown with her friend instead she definitely knew she wa scheduled to work today hopefully she get her life together amp x b not sure if this is the correct sub for this but maybe some of you have been in a similar position a me i m wondering if this is really something i shouldn t be concerned about or if i should do something sorry for the long post tl dr at bottom i work fd a nd and na two day each a week starting last week we hired a new housekeeper i m usually not made aware of new hire since i don t handle anything in their department my first night of na last week two young girl come in and ask to rent a room i get both of their id and they are both which is the age we will rent to people it wa at the last property i worked at i tell them the rate and confirm the one night reservation girl a will be the one with the debit card girl b is the other girl a oh well girl b is your coworker shouldn t she get an employee rate me really when wa your first day are you in housekeeping girl b well my first day is tomorrow in housekeeping and breakfast help me i can t guarantee you that rate for tonight since i really have no proof that you are an employee here our manager can adjust it tomorrow morning though before you check out they didn t make a fuss just agreed and went to their room i put them in a room close to the lobby they checked in just before midnight and the whole night until around am their door wa opening and closing constantly i didn t hear voice or see them go out to smoke or anything but i did see a junky car coming in and out of the parking lot at least ten time a younger man wa driving it i just rolled my eye and thought it wa some young kid with their first job trying to party with her friend before work besides the door slamming they were quiet the next day when i arrive for na nd shift informs me that girl b is back for the night ha the employee rate and girl a will be staying with her apparently two boy asked for their room key and nd told them he wouldn t give them key they were allowed to hang out with the girl but if they stay overnight he needed their id to put name on the reservation and would charge the girl for each extra guest staying they said they weren t staying and found the girl themselves once again on my shift the door wa opening and closing all night however this time i saw a different pair of two guy one maybe their age and one probably year older than them it wa dark but this guy had to be in his s or s carrying a case of beer to the alternate entrance i didn t see them actually go into the room but they were there for awhile and then they both left i wa gone for three day and just came back yesterday on nd shift the girl come back around to check in for another one day reservation girl b explains that they have been getting the discount i look and sure enough every day when i wa gone they had a one night reservation at the employee rate i asked why they keep making the reservation for one day at a time and they didn t have an answer for me i gave them their key after swiping the card and signing the paper work but this time i gave them a room farther away from the lobby the outside entrance on that side of the building are locked without a keycard so if they had more visitor they would have to let them in or come through the lobby two different boy than i ve seen before show up at the desk and ask for key to the pool i tell them that the pool is for registered guest only boy well we have friend here me oh do you know their room number sure enough it s the two girl i tell them that they can hang out here for awhile in their room but if they stay the night we will be charging their friend per extra guest they said they would only be here for a bit an hour or so later a different guy come to the desk and asks for a key to their room me i can t do that they need to let you into their room themselves new boy but i forgot some of my clothes and stuff up there me so are you staying there in the room with them new boy no i just forgot some stuff up there i really need to get it me then you can contact the girl to let you in i can t help you i have a really bad gut feeling that something is going on in this room each night i don t want to be judgmental but how do two year old girl afford a room each night that come to about after tax girl b wouldn t have gotten paid yet since she s only been here for a week maybe girl a is loaded and ha been funding their party week i m worried that they are selling drug or themselves out of these room since it s always different guy coming around each night how would i even confront anyone about this do i just keep my nose out of their business tl dr two year old girl keep staying at the hotel under the employee rate booking one night at a time i ve seen multiple different guy come to see them i m concerned that they are selling drug or their body to these creep do i say something or ignore it
hello i ve recently come across this subreddit and wanted to share a relatable story about a customer i ve posted this on r talesfromretail and i thought it would fit here a story for context i work at my campus coffee shop at this shop we are licensed to sell brand named coffee and a a result we are always having drink rush some item our coffee shop sell have no set price in the register system this mean we have to manually put them in we usually have chill level headed customer i ve never came arcoss a karen before althoughmy grandma wa a sweet karen during a drink rush my awesome coworkers ask the people behind the person at the register their drink order one person wa behind someone at the register we ll call her karen who wa an older woman who looked tired this wa probably because final week occurring at this time she mumbled her order trying to avoid speaking too much after i rung up the person right in front of her she moved forward i put on my charming energetic customer service extension of my personality to get her order when i asked what she wanted she said someone took her order and i say i need to make sure i know what to charge you for she say her drink is a latte i charge for a latte which is plus tax and cost a a result she then grab a biscuit cookie and ask to have that added to her order i input the item a per instruction given her order total out to be just a she see and here s the price she immediately disagrees she then asks why s it so expensive shouldn t it be five dollar i respond yeah but it s been taxed almost immediately she complained that she doesn t understand why it s so much for coffee all the while i m thinking she is having a hard time understanding math and sale tax my awesome coworker come over and try her best to fix the situation we remove the biscuit cookie and reenter the price to my amazement she still wasn t satisfied i explained the cookie is added to your order make it she responds with wasn t the coffee why is it her order without tax wa the tax wa not a lot in term of what she got after we explained it to her she change her mind saying i m just gonna go to the cafeteria this too expensive she then walk away to her next plan of action a she left my thought were the price is gonna be the same for the latte minus the cookie my badass coworker say when she s not in earshot the price is going to be the same regardless my two coworkers and i decide on what to do with the already made latte i tell my badass coworker to take it to a friend i say in the library she then went and gave it i waved to them the day ended without a hitch and my shift wa great i later found out that karen is a regular customer who often give the staff i work with trouble so i doubt i could have helped if i tried because it would been too expensive tldr karen doesn t like tax on a latte and biscuit cookie decides a somewhat smart decision is to go to place that charge the same while we give a drink to people surviving final week

so a few week ago my area wa hit with a blizzard we were allowing guest to cancel without penalty a long a it wasn t a pre paid or third party reservation the catch wa they actually had to call u though now this woman claim she called u to cancel but her reservation wa marked a a no show i wa going to give her the information to speak with our accounting department until she said that she disputed the charge with her credit card company and they denied her dispute at that time i told her that by disputing the charge with her credit card company she took her dispute out of our hand if her credit card company sided with u then there is literally nothing we can do she became a real karen at the situation because then she wa threatening with a lawsuit and my response wa that she need to have her lawyer call our legal department their lawyer can look up that information with our registered agent funny thing is she just said that this wa bad service i mean she may have gotten her money back if she called u first and somebody at central forgot to cancel the reservation but i think she never called to cancel

honest question we always get the same excuse asking for free cancelations via phone or chat for the same country for booking taking place to week after claiming that someone died we can never find a way to respectfully ask if burial take that long to happen and in my experience it is within a week can anyone share some light of we are being a s by denying free cancelations or doe it actually happen
service industry yr would be grateful for le labor etc love current employment make enough love employer should i buy sell the corporate lifestyle more opportunity amp x b before you ask this is a sale side of service industry i enjoy the hand on side but really can t do it forever i ve asked many question about this company and am happy with the answer this includes employee satisfaction rate customer approval turnover etc just hesitant about corporate because i love knowing my owner having them present seeing them daily arthritis in the shoulder etc ha been getting worse and ultimately i need to get out of it directly could make more in this corp and i ve asked about the detail and it sound like they do a lot of community donation eco minded thing so it s not a bad corp it s just different than working directly with my owner on a day to day i wouldn t do it if i couldn t sleep at night
not sure if this belongs here but many moon ago i worked a couple of summer working front desk for a car rental agency when writing up a customer for a rental one thing you are required to ask them if they want supplemental insurance it s basically an extra charge per day back then something day so that if get into an accident that insurance kick in and we don t make a claim on your insurance it is of course optional some agent had a pretty hard sell for it since it wa one of the metric they were judged on but i knew i wa only doing this job for the summer so i don t care i told you about it briefly you say no once i move on so that s the setup for my favorite customer story aside from the car repos i went on the loaded gun i found one day the customer offering me weed on the ride back seriously working a car rental place can be a blast it wa just a weekend rental for the guy i brought the car around front and went through the standard checkout routine i got to the supplemental insurance part and that s where the trouble started i gave him my standard low sell approach but that wasn t good enough i got the i already have insurance i don t need your overpriced scam you should be ashamed of yourself for even trying to foist on me etc pretty good a far a rant went for customer like that i do make sure i reiterate any damage then is their responsibility i leave him with the car and go back to my desk which face the front of the store and the parking lot so i get to watch a my customer start the car and proceeds to immediately back into the pole that wa behind his car and pull back into the spot totally caved in the back bumper and even dented the trunk he still need a car so of course after spending minute filling out the accident report i get him into a new one you better believe i asked him do you want the supplemental insurance this time he still said no

and why are they always so mean literally any other day of the week my customer are fantastic some of them are so great i wish i could sit down and just hang out with them but sunday oh fuck no myself and all my coworkers literally get shit on by of our customer on sunday and yes usually they look like they just got out of church they will find thing to complain about that aren t even valid and i m very much into the customer is always right approach if i fuck something up or the kitchen fuck something up i make that shit right and usually throw in a free dessert on top of whatever the manager comp but sunday complaint are almost never valid and they don t just complain they fucking degrade you and talk to you like you re a piece of shit also i looked at our company google review to see if my name had popped up in the last month or so one of my customer last week ordered an appetizer and it had a longer cook time and didn t come out a fast a the other table queso which he had a huge issue with that wa the only problem with that table period well the dude wrote a review complaining about how he asked for no mustard on his burger and it came out with mustard this did not happen at all we don t put mustard on anything we have bottled mustard that we send out to the table the kitchen doesn t even have it back there it come straight from yours truly he also stated that the employee all look super miserable and like they hate their life and i will never come back here being the stalker that i am i put his name into facebook and sure enough a bunch of post pop up with a mutual friend one of the cook so it seems like they are relatively decent friend why the fuck would you go into your friend place of work where your friend is a cook and state that the kitchen put mustard on your burger and then say that all of u look miserable i kinda want to screenshot the message and send it to my buddy and just be like your friend is a fucking dick and a liar but i m sure i d get in trouble for that somehow since he s also a customer i love my job but i hate the sunday crowd
this wa gonna be a comment reply to someone else s post but it got long enough and elaborate enough to where it s probably better off at it own post i had people with a sort of flight crew that we have a standing corporate rate with come in one night about a month ago four people walk in their leader power walk right up to the desk like he owns the place and slam his hand on the counter demanding four room sidebar i don t know about anyone else here but any and all willingness i have to jump through hoop or make thing work for somebody go poof after a display like that none of the entitlement discount are available my prime room floor aren t available they re not getting anything more than the bare minimum from that point on for those of you who are imagining the worst most unfriendly and unaccommodating hotel employee ever my guest survey score lead all front desk agent at my hotel and my gm get compliment about me regularly anyway this guy slap his hand on the counter like gilbert gottfried and shout we re with company and we need four room a if i m his slow servant and i m deaf in one ear whoop i only have two room left and they don t gots reservation but both of these room are two queen room and there s four of them do the math they were also ada room so more space i make the suggestion this idiot reacts a if i just took a dump in his luggage no no no that s unacceptable that s against faa regulation we need four separate room we can t share room that s a violation we need four room we all need to be at the same hotel this go on and on with him repeating the same few sentence until i cut him off suggesting the few other hotel in the area that might still have room most were sold out that evening well do they have a rate with u the company he demand that i call around to not only find room but a hotel with a corporate rate agreement with them normally i would have said fat fucking chance at doing either one of those thing find your own hotel and try making reservation at that one and maybe ditch the george steinbrenner routine but in the interest of getting this jackass out of my lobby before i voiced one of these ugly thought out loud i called the homecork up the street since they had called me earlier looking for walk relos they still had room but they had never even heard of the company and their rack rate per room wa about higher than their corporate rate would have been here i get off the phone with them and tell jackass that will likely be the best deal they can get in the area tonight if all four of them need to be at the same property they go for it and clear out without thanking me for my effort have a nice night now this guy wa a top tier member consult the animated bear video and told me so multiple time during his diatribe could maybe should i have given him room due to his status and taken u possibly because i could have held room at homecork but this stack of shit brick decided to scream at me from the minute he walked in and thought he could browbeat me into bending the knee so i made him go to another hotel and made him spend an extra and we sold out anyway so get mad
over the year i ve gotten to know the doggy in the neighborhood from a little distance our building is pet free which is nice professionally no potty mess in the hallway even though i like animal when it s really hot out and i see a good boy or girl walking down the street i bring out some cold water for the doggo i think it s being a good neighbor to the community even though my bos couldn t probably care le anyways there are three particularly cartoonish dog that i get to see regularly and cheer me up the first is a longhaired miniature dachshund our street might be one of the windiest in the city so most of the time i see this little guy walking his hair is blowing back and you can tell he s giving it his all to complete the walk owner isn t too different someday i d like to get a pic of him walking in the wind but so far i haven t quite got it i could see them a a new yorker cartoon with a sparse caption like i m a boat i m a boat the second belongs to some sort of young professional he s a lab and a good boy but he requires a lot of coaching from the owner they stop every meter or so so have him sit and show a little self control they are super cute together and you can tell they have a lot of give and take they work really hard to be good to each other and it s darling they are the first part of a romantic comedy where a guy come along and can t compete with the dog third is the winner for me he s a white whippet that hunch over a he slowly walk down the street he s owned by a white old man that hunch over a he slowly walk down the street i ve never seen a dog and owner look so perfectly matched it s like a norman rockwell cartoon walking by whenever i see them i get super excited like i m seeing a shooting star my bos happens to appreciate this one

at my restaurant all server have to tipshare a percentage of their sale with the bartender apparently it is like a thank you for the bartender making drink for other table and because the bartender might be too busy making drink to take enough table for themself i am very much against this since the majority of the time the bartender get all the people who want to sit in the bar plus their table so they almost always end up having more in sale than pretty much anyone else at the restaurant anyway so i made x number of sale yesterday with very little tip from the shift after doing the math my tipshare to the bartender came to exactly the number of tip i made for the whole shift e g if i made in sale and in tip if tipshare wa of sale i would have to give to bartender i let her know i wouldn t be tipsharing since the tipshare amount is all i made in sale she immediately called our manager and fussed about it i ended up having to hand it over so i went home having put in a hour shift with exactly in income god bless tipsharing amp x b edit i didn t say wa the tipshare percentage i wa trying to give an example although the real number is still quite high
i ve been a server for about year this past summer i worked at a new restaurant and it went really well so when i wa home from school for winter break i picked up a few shift i m back at school now but my manager asked if i wa available for valentine s day weekend a few week ago i m only an hour away from home the restaurant so it wouldn t be a huge deal for me to go home for the weekend to work but me and my boyfriend had already started making plan for that weekend after talking about it with him we decided that we could definitely use the extra money so i told my manager i wa available now tonight the schedule for next weekend came out and i wa not on it i wa actually pretty excited and told my boyfriend we could have our weekend after all it s also our year anniversary the day after valentine i texted my manager to confirm and that s when she said the dreaded i will have you on call for friday and saturday i ll admit i m also a little bitter at them because on the last shift i had before going back to school where i wa definitely on the schedule they texted me two hour before i wa supposed to go in to let me know they were slow and didn t need me i had skipped out on a family weekend trip just for that shift and spent my last weekend home all alone for no reason so i wa a little pissed now i don t want to waste gas money and drive an hour to spend the romantic weekend with my parent in hope that i will be asked to work but i also feel rude because i did tell them i wa available however i meant that i could make myself available if they definitely needed me not that i would be around anyway what is the appropriate thing to do here is it totally rude of me to tell my manager i don t want to be on call or if it s okay how should i go about saying that have you guy ever been in this kind of situation and what did you end up doing
for about three year now i ve worked at a brampton bin shitty management and gossipy coworkers made my life hell for quite awhile but somehow i m feeling melancholy during my final shift the job is great and i ll really miss it i ve seen so many staff come and go during my time here the opportunity i m moving on for is infinitely better but part of me feel like i wa the guardian of this building having worked here for so long and been the only one in the whole place for so many shift guest rave about me in their survey but i ve always gone unrecognized and unappreciated by the lazy rude gm i ve gone through hell and back working here but somehow it all feel worth it is it weird to feel emotionally attached to a building it feel so bittersweet to be leaving and i m holding back tear i feel like my year here have been a huge accomplishment and i m regretting not finding a way to celebrate seven hour to go before i say goodbye
i used to work at a place in downtown austin tx we had a big patio out front with a pretty garden on the other side of the walk since it wa a restaurant we tried to keep any critter from living in the garden we already had enough cleanup to deal with from the pigeon and grackle we were mostly successful until a juvenile opossum moved in he wa pretty bold but relatively harmless so we didn t really hurry to find a solution to his living situation at first he mostly stayed hidden until after closing so the owner put out a few trap and we hoped for the best the little fella wa too smart for that and the trap remained empty one morning while we had the door propped open to receive a delivery our breakfast server walked up to me and whispered that we had a customer in our gift shop who needed me i followed her to the front room and there he wa little mr opossum checking out our selection of handmade local jewelry and craft we quietly shooed him out the door before any guest saw and we hoped that would be the end of it the owner redoubled his trapping campaign that week but again the marauding marsupial wa too smart to get caught he knew he had it pretty good in our garden and he wa making every effort to maintain his tenancy around this time mr opossum also decided that the patio that the human were all sitting on wasn t so scary after all more than once during a dinner shift server spotted the little freeloader searching for dropped food among the table or climbing the railing again he would be quietly shooed away so our guest didn t notice him the next week during our big delivery he wasn t found in the gift shop instead he bypassed it and went straight to the dining room we knew he had to be stopped he had gone too far but what to do he d eluded every trap we put out we couldn t poison him because who know where his stinky carcass would end up and we really didn t want to kill him if we didn t have to many of the staff had gotten attached to him and we didn t want a full on mutiny over one eight inch marsupial we had an entire manager meeting that focused on the possum problem and by the end of it i had convinced the owner that the catch and release plan i came up with could work it would require the entire team s cooperation but i wa certain my bleeding heart coworkers would be on board if it meant saving mr opossum s life so in our evening pre shift meeting that week i reviewed the plan with the foh staff i coached the boh staff a well a they would be needed too i bought extra broom and staged them near the patio door and we waited each night for our little buddy to show himself until the night when one of the server came running in from the patio to tell me the time had come guy you all know what to do commence operation opossum the foh dropped whatever they were doing the kitchen spared who they could to assist and my team of opossum wrangler all grabbed their broom and proceeded to herd mr opossum toward me a i waited with an empty bus tub it wa a tense few minute mr o zigged he zagged he ran up a drain pipe and wa turned back in the nick of time he deftly climbed the baker s rack we used a a server station and almost got away but at the last minute alecia knocked him off right into the waiting bustub along with the staff our customer who witnessed the incident broke out into applause a i secured the lid on the tub thankfully our patron were entertained and not grossed out i handed over my key to the bartender with strict instruction not to burn the place down while i wa gone and i headed to my car with the tub i drove mr o to the lake that run through downtown and released him near a stand of bush i d picked out day earlier a the best spot to give him a fighting chance and thus ended a time that i will always remember fondly both for the compassion of the folk i worked with and the cuteness of the critter for whom we had to find a more suitable accommodation pest are always a pain to get rid of but not all pest are awful i hope mr o lived a long and fruitful life
if i say my restaurant ha gone through we re currently on our th driver in four month what s y alls first reaction

this happened a few month back i ve been serving bartending at the same restaurant pretty much since it s opened year it s a nice upscale place with good food and i ve learned the rope anyways have a table of come in one night couple one set of couple order their own apps and the other opts to share a meatball appetizer which come to an order i put share plate for the two sharing the meatball and a spoon in the bowl of meatball for serving the gentleman interrupt me a i m setting it down and asks why it s in one bowl instead of two i respond that it doesn t make sense to split it in the kitchen a we would have to cut a meatball in half he then say to me you clearly didn t study math in school to which i responded with a pleasant smile no but i have a degree in biology i then say with my best server face if you d like i ll take it back to the kitchen and have them cut it in half for you he immediately shut up and served his own meatball while his wife who clearly realized her husband wa being an as wore a shit eating grin at my comment it s important to learn how to make people realize their own ignorance while maintaining your server mannerism
short story that mean a lot to me i live in an area where human trafficking is common just the other day someone i know wa leaving a mall and a man reached for her car door right when she got inside anyways i work for a restaurant that ha an option for curbside takeout where they can pull up to the curb next to the restaurant and their food will be brought out to them unfortunately people lack the common sense to call and let u know that they are sitting there and frequently come inside angry saying that they ve been waiting for a long time this piss me off always especially when it s at night i had a couple do this the other day and when they came in i felt so good saying to them yep next time we d appreciate if you called we re not really comfortable with employee walking out to car that we re unfamiliar with that seemed to confuse them not sure why but damn it felt good like sorry i m not walking out to random car and going up to their door hoping that it s the right car nope
logic had a customer today ask if we had a senior drink available we do a senior drink is a small drink for senior that is very inexpensive he then asked if he could get that but make it large wtf
so i do le bartending and serving these day but when i do one of my favorite type of customer are always the customer who know what they want a lot of server i know complain about people who don t want to be social but those are among my favorite people you go to their table tell them you ll be helping them out and then they simply tell ya what they want it s nice to have reprieve from the song and dance routine that a lot of guest want anyways wondered about how different people here view this
so we have the most incompetent kitchen staff i have ever worked with in my year in the business i can t even believe these people are still working we have the dish washer who never change the water so every morning we have to rewatch everything that s clean i m talking black flake of god know what everywhere it s all in out glassware and all over our plate he doesn t rinse anything before putting it in the machine then when he s putting it all away he doesn t pick out anything that wasn t clean s properly all of our spoon get stuck together and we have to soak them it s a total hassle and no one not a single one of my four manager will fix it then you get the cook who touch raw chicken and then grab the hamburger bun it s a disaster waiting to happen i went through a good month of the cook calling me name in spanish which i am almost fluent in and management wouldn t do anything the cook were refusing to cook my order because i have complained to management so i had to go to corporate now they cook my food but they are still difficult to work with st rule of working on a line work the first ticket but instead they do all of one type of dish at once and it just end up sitting there i m talking let me make steak when i only need one on the ticket and then put it in the window and have it die until everyone else ha caught up to me nd rule don t put up incomplete ticket this becomes an issue then we all get yelled at for asking for the item they neglected to put on the plate i m immediately an asshole for calling for a side of loaded mash time because no one is listening if the ticket wa finished correctly this wouldn t be an issue and finale rule communicate you don t get to be mad at me if i put in an order for a side of broccoli and we don t have any but you didn t tell me that and if i call for something let me know you heard me instead of having me call for it time before you tell me to fuck off it s not rocket science if i call for it and you say heard then i know it s working i m tired of being told well he s been a cook for year that doesn t matter the me if you can t do your job correctly you cannot expect the foh staff to stay on if you can t control your boh this is why i put in my two week and have no remorse that s it that s my ted talk

it great to be back month after quitting the little room hell hole in sf i moved to chicago and immediately got a job working at a franchised scarylot rhyme with near the airport now month later i am done but wanted to find another job first and i did in a great little well run boutique hotel with room in the northern part of the city or course this room scarylot wasn t what a wanted and i didn t want to deal with the day to day crazy and poor managment so i found something else i wa waiting for something crazy to happen at this amazing boutique so that i could finally return and post here luckily for all of u something ha happened now that i am back full time on night audit or course crazy thing happen that some people have the tendency to forget this would be the case with this guest he suddenly had complete memory loss i guess that is what happen when you book room after midnight for le than day later it wa just after midnight on the th a man with an accent call looking to reserve a room with bedroom for the night of the th to th i informed him that while i wa able to do the night of the th we were sold out on the th he thanked me and hung up a few minute later he called me back stating that he now wanted the night of the rd to the th and asked if there wa a possibility of cancellation for the night of the th god i hate that question i mean really sure it possible any idiot would know this though i told him that a we are such a small property and we take full non refundable payment day in advance that while unlikely it could still happen he didn t seem to get it he wanted to book the room anyway he asked me about the parking rate which is dollar per night and then attempted to get me to waive it when i said i couldn t he then suddenly decided that he probably wouldn t have a car anyway and would get back to me if he did or course he never got back to me i set him up with his reservation email him is confirmation and re confirm all of his information including asking him again if is sure he want to do this a we do not have availability for a br on the night of the th he thought for a minute and changed his mind before i could close out the reservation he called back changing his mind yet again and wanted to proceed with booking the room at this point i wa beginning to wonder if he wa just a confused guy or he wa up to something turn out i wa right on the later a i always am however i made the booking and didn t think much of it after that last night roll around and i come to find out that he hadn t shown up thought it wa odd because he had also requested a slightly early check in of around our check in time is pm due to the fact that i wa the one to deal with him on the phone i decided to send him an email asking if he wa still planning on arriving a short while later he email me back saying that he wa planning on coming on the th for night ah crap here we go it a good thing that i have a good memory when it come to talking to these fool i informed him of our conversation and how he had requested those date yet i made it very clear to him that the night of the th wasn t available for a br he claimed he didn t remember any or our phone conversation from night ago um ok how could you forget sir i wa on the phone with you for over an hour i again informed him that he had asked if we would have a cancellation and how i reconfirmed the booking with him several time for night for a date he didn t even really want for a while there wa no response in the email around am he call after multiple email back and forth he stated that i would give him the bedroom or i would give him a bedroom at a discount with roll aways and free parking due to his inconvenience a he didn t want to have to move i wouldn t have been able to put his people in a bedroom anyway aha i knew it he wa up to something or again wa he just confused i told him that i wouldn t be able to do that due to fire code and the fact that he chose the date he chose and his email confirmation even stated his date he of course hung up at that this point just a i wa about to cancel his reservation he email again stating that i will cancel a reservation to accommodate him my response wa i m sorry sir but per your request the reservation ha already been cancelled and refunded you should receive a refund within to business day it could be slightly longer due to the holiday truth is it hasn t been cancelled yet a my manager ha to do the refund i have yet to hear back from this guy so what do you think is he just some confused idiot or wa he being shady trying to get a massive discount my guess would be the latter
still kind of shook that my bos let this happen if you ve got thought or tip please share in the comment a looking for advice on handling this a well i m an off duty manager tonight but one of my team phoned because she had people checking into two room and she wa a bit concerned one of them wa an underage woman then we had an year old woman and a man who we believe wa in his mid to late s they booked through fecking com and the mum of one of the girl paid for their room and the man paid for his own big big big red flag for me at this point i told my receptionist to refuse the room but to speak to our general manager first to check if there wa any other procedure he said to speak to the mum and we did she emailed a scan of the card and a scan of her passport so he said to give them the room at this point i am so concerned both me and eileen fake name are doubting his decision my final issue is she didn t take the detail of any of their card for damage if it s actually a scam and they damage the room we are totally totally screwed am i just being too paranoid
at my old property we cleaned the sliding glass door and large glass window surrounding them around pm and pm i would get my cleaning spray and rag and spend about minute cleaning them about of our guest at this property were construction worker or auto plant worker staying month at a time who usually had greasy or dirty hand without fail every time i wa cleaning the glass door one of these guest of the time construction worker or plant worker of the time random one night guest would be walking in or out and would stop to imitate me cleaning the glass door while making a stupid face or they would pretend they were going to put their palm on the freshly cleaned door and make a stupid oopsy face on a daily basis someone would stop to mimic my cleaning movement while making a goofy face i cannot tell you how much this annoyed the shit out of me i would be pissed off every night i tried to let it go but it wa so obnoxious that this many people think that s funny and not annoying but one guest pushed it too far it wa a construction worker and he wa one of the many guest who repeatedly did this stupid joke pretending to put his palm on the glass door well the last time he did it i rolled my eye at him and walked away maybe that offended him or maybe me rejecting him by not giving my phone number wa the trigger either way that night instead of pretending to stick his palm on the glass i just cleaned he deliberately stuck his palm to the glass and laughed it left a huge greasy hand print i guess he thought i d roll my eye and continue cleaning instead i blocked the door a he tried to walk inside and tried to hand him the rag and spray he stood there looking utterly confused me here you go use this to clean up the mess you just made please him after second of confused staring i wa just kidding girl me that s nice here you go this time he take the rag and spray i stood there with my arm crossed while he cleaned his handprint off hopefully he learned a lesson because while many others continued that stupid joke he never did again
so last night saturday wa uncharacteristically disorganised this wa due to a combination of kitchen staff being late and two of our primary floor staff being rostered off this situation meant that for almost half of service we were running on reduced staff in both front and back of house this already stressful situation wa not made better by the presence of a top of which half were child under not only did this table have kid interfering with our pathway they also had a delightful man who satisfies every stereotypical definition of an unreasonable customer this man hit all the check extreme overexaggeration of wait time claimed an hour wait for food when it wa no more than minute normal for a busy saturday rudely addressing the floor staff particularly woman and arguing with staff over what food we serve now for reference our restaurant serf taco of two different shell soft wheat or hard corn we do not sell soft corn or hard wheat a point which is made clear by our menu and our staff this man refused to accept that this wa true claiming our menu suggested otherwise rather than calmly accepting that his taco couldn t be made with soft corn he instead climbed atop his high horse in effort to assert dominance obviously he a customer who doesn t work in the restaurant know our menu better than experienced staff after having to deal with this man i immediately informed the bos that a complaint may be headed his way in due time the bos stop by the table to mitigate any complaint and we go about service but then something i have not ever had the pleasure of witnessing before happened the other people at the table actively took our side probably only minute after the bos had dealt with the table he told me that one of the woman came up to him and said don t worry about that man he s always a dick and wouldn t you believe it mr i want soft corn taco did a complete no more snarky comment no more argument only smile and humility for the rest of the night customer enabled vindication really is the sweetest treat of all
rant here i work at a decent hotel chain i ve been here since september i wa told i would get a raise at day then then and now day i feel really strung along i know my performance is good i bend over backwards coming in early when needed on day off with le than an hour notice to when i need to be there i do night audit and i strip room when it not required of me i do extra cleaning thats not required of me i even came in a early a i could the other day on my mom birthday when one of the front desk people oded on heroin i hate complaining but when the other night auditor put people card down her shirt threatens them with scissors sleep on the job and walk around with no shoe on it hard to be satisfied the owner refuse to work anyone over hour a pay period and while it may not seem like a lot that extra day a week would help especially when the manager said i wa needed hour week and for month straight i worked hour a week

this happened about a month back i am an fom at a resort karen made a reservation a month before arrival she called time asking for a free upgrade this wa her literal phrasing they ve booked a basic studio we are happy to give free upgrade when something is wrong etc but because you want one no i m lucky enough to be working desk when karen and husband arrive fortunately i m good at dealing with difficult customer through humor and checkin go well there is a joke about wanting a free upgrade i explain that we made sure housekeeping gave her room the vip treatment a baby crawl so i m not comfortable moving her because i want to make sure the room is at a very high standard karen immediately freeze up asking if something is wrong with room that don t get this treatment no i explain we just want to give them the vip treatment checkin completed minute later phone call to front desk she cannot stay in the studio a it adjoins to one of our suite and she cannot stay in a room that adjoins she ha had people walk into her room at two different hotel and ha a paralyzing fear of such a thing happening i explain that our resort not a line this is true ha the most modern security available a it s only a few year old in construction so if she keep her door locked there is no way someone can accidentally wander in and no one is checked into the room next to her i can also put the room next to her off market to ensure this not good enough want a non adjoining studio i don t have any i explain i can upgrade her to a non adjoining suite but she will have to pay for it there s nothing wrong with the room she s staying in she just doesn t like it she explains she ll pay but they will never stay here again ok fine when you say that a far a i m concerned you re no longer a customer we want business from husband will be down with key so i can do the room switch husband come down explains they travel a lot and get a lot of free upgrade where they stay regularly they ve stayed with u once in three year i do key exchange and swipe cc to do room swap minute later karen come down furious i can smell the sulfur and brimstone their is mold in the shower tile grout in their original studio room and she is deathly allergic to mold and that my line about vip treatment wa a load of shit it wasn t i d conferred with housekeeping i wanted no issue with this guest upon arrival explains how she and her husband travel million of mile each year and get free upgrade at insert several famous hotel name drop here at this point i realize i have lost i comp their upgrade she take the number of the head of housekeeping so she can meet with him when he arrives first thing in the morning to educate him on proper cleaning supply but that meeting never happens starting at am the next morning in their new non adjoining upgraded suite housekeeping and janitorial will have to visit the room time each day for three day a she ha a bug that is causing her body to expel everything from anywhere it can be expelled sheet change floor mopping carpet shampooing these are all necessary multiple time a day she can t come out of her room for the duration of their stay and complains to the front desk staff on day that we don t have a doctor who can make house call when she should probably be quarantined in the er it wa like having regan macneil stay in the room when she wa fully possessed and in the middle of the exorcism checkout day arrives i am out front when she check out she look pale but thing have slowed down for their drive and she proceeds to give me a list of cleaning product that housekeeping should be using and that her meal wa too salty the night she arrived i thanked her for the feedback and sent her on her way i didn t take the time to point out to her on her bill the doubled extra cleaning fee added to her bill a a result of her being a source of toxic waste but we haven t been charged back so there s that edit to everyone asking why i didn t turf her i don t have that authority the way we are set up here i can give discount and upgrade etc for retention but not refuse service and while i feel sorry for the housekeeping and house staff that did so many cleanup if she hadn t stayed i would not have gotten to enjoy the delicious delicious schadenfreude of her biohazard ness and the gm did dnr her
before you read on the property i work at sits every new person down in a meeting and discus what prostitution drug trafficking and human trafficking look like in a hotel if you see any of that or suspect any of it we are to call either manager and get their opinion however if it s clear a day illegal activity call the cop let them know after the cop are called so they can get on the camera and monitor the situation we even have police come in and talk to u about this stuff during work meeting working a shift i noticed a man walking in and out of the hotel a lot car would drive up to the hotel he d go out there quickly hand them something and then go their separate way a woman wa staying in the room with him she kept her head down a lot she wa nice though the man in the room stopped though and a random red car came speeding through my parking lot he ran out and got into the car and they drove off i didn t see him for a while it got to be about pm at night i wa finishing up some paperwork sipping on coffee and the red car came back speeding the dude from the room ran in and told me he need the name reservation changed at my property we don t mind name change to reservation because they usually need it for billing expense report or they re part of our award program and want the point however in this instance i told him the name on file ha to stay the same for it is policy the original name stay i only said this because he wa doing some sketchy stuff all day i couldn t figure out what i had no complaint so i couldn t kick them out gm said i couldn t either but him wanting to change the name on the reservation to his sparked lot of red flag the reservation name wa under the woman s name who kept her head down the entire time he got annoyed of course i kept my foot down and he walked off luckily i noticed they were checking out the next morning so i wasn t too worried the next day i pulled up for my shift i see the same man outside with a weird pipe in his hand walking around my building he kept trying to get into the building you have to have a key to enter also they were checked out of the system i told my co worker to not extend the stay i called my co worker who wa working that morning and asked if he checked out or not she said he checked out this morning and there s other people hiding in the stairwell he s associated with and she wasn t sure if she should call the police or not i noticed him coming around the front to the building to enter through the front i told her to get off the phone and to watch him i walked into the building and when i walked in the man had apparently dropped the pipe whatever wa in it wa everywhere and there wa broken glass everywhere he cleaned it up we swept really good and he disappeared while we had our back turned i called my gm and told her what ha been going on and that there are possibly people in the stairwell hiding she told me to not call the police and my co worker and i to go into the stairwell i grabbed my mace gun and put it in the front pocket of my hoodie told my co worker to grab the bear mace we had at the front desk and to follow me we were not happy about this we just wanted to call the police but nope bos said no so of course we found the people that were in the stairwell hiding with all of their belonging i have never seen these people before though i just told them i wa the night manager on duty and i nicely told them that this is a form of trespassing they cannot be in my stairwell hiding and asked how they even got into the hotel she told me her friend let her in through the side door and she doe have a reservation for the night i informed her again i am being super nice and calm that she need to either sit in the lobby and wait for the room to be ready or go somewhere else in city to hang out and wait she went she started screaming at me and telling me i am being mean to her and that she ha cancer and that i have to give her whatever she want and she can be in the stairwell if she want i wa not in the mood for any of this i wa being very nice to her i wa calm my co worker wasn t having it either however i guess she could tell my jaw clenched up because my patience wa very thin that day lack of sleep doe that to me i kept my cool still i got stern though i told her she can either go into the lobby and wait or go somewhere in the city to hang out she screamed she doesn t have a car i calmly told her i will be seeing her in the lobby then i waited in the stairwell told me co worker to go into the lobby and make sure they all go there we stayed on the phone with each other to confirm i got back down to the lobby and i called my gm to let her know what wa happening she said if they give me anymore issue to call the police and kick them out i checked them into their room i put them on the first floor they asked for a higher floor i told them that wa the only room i had clean at that moment if there are sketchy people staying in the hotel we put them on the first or second floor we can hear the side door opening and closing she took the room within an hour just an hour there wa already foot activity the woman who wa in the hotel the night before who tried to have the reservation name changed came in through the side and had random car driving up and then leaving all day exact same activity a the night before it got to be pm people were calling for that room every minute all different people i had enough they were clearly dealing drug out of the room i called my gm told her what s been happening all day she said call the police have them with you in the hotel a you kick them out i called the non emergency number for the police and explained what ha been happening for the past two night how they were hiding in the stairwell what wa happening with the crazy amount of activity in the room the police came i wa talking to one of the officer in the lobby the one who dropped his pipe in the lobby turned the corner saw the cop eye went wide his face white and ran out of the hotel i pretended to not see him i whispered to the cop what just happened and he nodded his head and then asked for the register card they signed the day before i gave it to them they looked at me with wide eye the officer had a smirk on his face of joy i asked what wa the matter he said he will be right back he ran outside to his partner his partner ran in with a phone they showed me a picture of a wanted woman it wa the same woman who kept having car drive up for her i asked what she did apparently she ha been dealing drug and had gotten into trouble failed to show up to court she had a list and she wa doing that stuff out of my hotel room even though the woman wa wanted the others in the room were not they ran their name so legally going by what the police said they cannot force the rest out i can tell them to leave and if they refuse after i told them to leave then they can make them leave they said they already had a feeling that they will have to do that anyways so i called the room to tell them they are being told to leave by the gm however the phone wa unhooked i told the cop they unhooked the phone they said they can stay out of sight a i confront them face to face to get out so we went to the room i knocked the woman who screamed at me asked what i wanted and i told her to open the door all the way to please she did i calmly told her due to all of the activity in going in and out of the room phone call of different people car speeding through my parking lot you letting random people in through the side door and them leaving never to be seen a well a unhooking my phone that they have minute to get off my property she said she wasn t leaving i told her i am adding smoking to the list of reason she is leaving it wa like a cloud in that room it smelled of pot and something else i couldn t put my finger on she said she wasn t leaving again i told her if that is the case then the police can escort her out so she can either leave in minute or in minute the police can come and get her out she said she ll be out in minute they refused to leave after minute because the guy who ran out of the hotel told them the police were outside they were now hiding the wanted woman in the room police were not leaving till they got her i literally just wanted them off my property them getting a wanted woman wa their business either way in order for the people to leave she had to leave the police asked for every possible way to get out of the hotel i showed them all side door stair well they can hide in a well a the window of that room my hotel face a major road the road lead to a major interstate and there are hotel everywhere in this part of the town they basically put the hotel on lock down for this woman and then shut down part of the major road that wa in front of the hotel so she couldn t go anywhere the woman who screamed at me came out of the room and asked if she can stay another night woman they shut down part of the road because you were hiding a wanted woman in the room get out i told her no and that anybody associated with the woman in the room is band from the property the police then pulled her aside and asked her question she wa acting shocked then yelled i have cancer you can t make me leave i feel for anybody who is sick with anything but at this point i have guest checking in with police car and cop all over my building and property and a road shut down in the front and you re over here hiding a wanted woman in my hotel room and refusing to leave she went back to the room she started packing her stuff i am not sure what the police said to her but she started complying after minute it wa dead silent in the hotel some dude wa at my desk telling me about the super smash bros tournament going on in town i wa intrigued by this not gonna lie however after a lobby went very silent and then there wa a lot of yelling next thing i know they were bringing her through the lobby in handcuff so that part wa over with the dude at the desk just slowly turned to me and said i used to work in a hotel tell me everything a the police were leaving my hotel somebody came in looking for the woman they just arrested i just stared at him and told him she isn t here anymore he asked to go to the room she wa in i said no and that the people in that room have minute to get out or the police will escort them out police were still outside making sure the people left he asked if he can help them get out of the room then to make it go faster i agreed to it i walked him to the room and knocked on the door he did help them get out of the room faster however they were in the lobby waiting for a cab and the whole time he wa talking shit about me and then he started hitting on me he called somebody and told them to find out who called the cop and that to handle it for him i flat out told them to get the f out and that i wa not going to be threatened at my work he started cussing and yelling i just pointed towards the door telling them all to get out they were finally gone then the hotel across the street called and asked about them i could still hear the man yelling and threatening me that red headed bch is gonna get it f her i told them what happened all i could hear were the other front desk worker there telling them to get out i called the

so disclaimer i don t work in a hotel but i do work for in house marketing and customer service for a korean spa in my area that offer overnight stay i used to work the floor so i m pretty familiar with all sort of customer service issue that come through our door but this wa a new one for some background korean spa have admission fee that are essentially the guest s day pas to use all the sauna lounge area different type of hot tub etc and overall just relax with no time limit our spa sell individual pass but we also sell them in a discounted multiple entry bundle and they re valid on any day up to their year expiration date on january st we rolled out a new policy allowing u to still accept expired ticket but we d just have to upcharge guest for that day s admission cost on weekday the upcharge would be and on weekend it would be previously we used to just not accept the ticket altogether and make guest pay full price so this is honestly an improvement from a customer standpoint and so far most of our guest have been more than happy to pay the fee since they can still use their expired ticket cue this old lady who come in a couple day ago a weekday with what looked to be her husband and a friend now our office is situated right by the front door and lobby so manager can be on hand easily whenever the check in check out line get busy the door to the office is ajar but also say employee only in clear signage this will be important later a front desk attendant come in and let u know that a guest ha expired admission ticket doesn t wanna pay the fee which would only have been usd and wa told by a manager that go to her church that her ticket would still be accepted so the floor manager for the day go out to the front desk to talk to her next thing you know u in the office hear a whole lot of yelling and arguing going back and forth we re nosy and look at the camera and we see this old lady waving her hand around and refusing to be let in for free while the manager just repeat that he cannot do that for her at one point she even tried to throw the ticket over the desk at him finally after about minute of this she pay and then go in with her guest manager come back to the office everything seems peachy but about minute later this old lady walk right tf through our office door employee only holding her arm out and pointing dagger at the manager she spoke to meanwhile me and my coworkers are just sitting at our laptop doing our work with this lady way too close to our table m manager cl crazy lady cl are you the manager here m getting up from his seat uh yes ma am i am one of the manager what can i do for you cl you charged me for the entry fee even though i had ticket m well ma am your ticket were expired so we just needed to charge you for the difference in price you were still able to use your ticket cl well that s ridiculous what kind of policy is that these ticket are supposed to be free m i apologize but they expire after year so instead of turning you away entirely our policy is to have guest match the difference we announced it on our website and our social medium at the beginning of the month i can show it to you on our website if you d like cl well i didn t see that m well just because you didn t see it doesn t mean that it doesn t exist again i m happy to show you where we have it in our policy list cl this is absolutely ridiculous year i ve been in this country year and i ve never seen anything like this m ma am i can assure you that many other business have expiration date on their coupon cl no they don t i ve never seen that m they definitely do and i am just following company policy cl company policy that s ridiculous you made this policy m ma am i did not make this policy cl yes you did m again i am not the policymaker i am just the policy upholder cl you made this policy and it s a stupid policy so they went back and forth like this for about minute clearly my coworkers and i are immature bc we kind of wanted to laugh at how out of pocket the whole situation wa and it got hard to keep a straight face the angrier we got lol finally my manager wa clearly getting fed up with this old as lady m ma am you are causing a scene and distracting our employee a you ve walked into an employee only area i m happy to discus this with you outside the office they move right outside the door but we can still hear them arguing still in awe of how my manager stayed calm and kept his voice level even a she screamed at him cl still going off about how the new policy suck and is bad business among all sort of other thing m i m sorry but if you continue disrupting our environment like this we will have to ask you to leave the premise cl leave the premise i wa forced to pay m i can show you in the lobby where we have our facility rule stating we have the right to remove any customer who are deemed to be disruptive and abusive towards staff cl well i won t be leaving i want to know why i had to pay extra m oh you re not leaving i ll have to call the police then if you refuse to leave cl go ahead then call the police if you want i m the one who wa scammed m alright i will so just to get your verbal acknowledgment of this you re refusing to leave private property cl yes i am m okay great before i call can i just confirm again that you re refusing to leave and admit to trespassing into an employee only area cl yes because you made a bad policy m so i can call the police cl go ahead and call the police i won t leave m so again just to confirm again you will not leave even after you ve been asked and told that we have the right to remove disruptive people from the building cl tired of these circle yes do it go ahead and call them so my manager pulled out his phone and from what it sounded like started dialing i think her other guest finally came and collected her before anything could actually happen and they ended up leaving a she muttered to herself about the crazy ridiculous policy lol to top it all off my manager walked back into the office like nothing even happened no police were called after all but we were all just shook at how that one event really took up a good chunk of our workday and prop to our manager for not bending over for entitled customer not a single bit i do wish i could ve seen this little old lady try to explain this waste of time to the responding officer that would ve showed up tl dr old lady get upset at a new expired admission policy at our spa trespass into a restricted area to confront manager manager doe not bend threatens to call the police to remove her for trespassing onto private property and disturbing staff all while freely admitting her action all over
i recently started a an assistant in the dining room of a boarding house if someone ha put their serviette on top of their plate or inside of their dessert bowl is it okay to assume they have finished should i ask them excuse me do you mind if i take your plate bowl or is it okay for me to just take it especially if they are in conversation i don t want to disturb them but i ve also been told that asking show respect for them when i give someone their dessert what should i say when i give people their main meal i usually say enjoy your meal but that sound kinda strange for dessert and previously i ve just said enjoy up until now but that also sound kinda strange to me i ve also had other time where i ve not said anything just waited for them to say thankyou and then replied you re welcome is the last way the best way again assuming they are in conversation i want to interrupt a little a possible do i need to say you re welcome even or can i just give it and walk away should i say thankyou when taking someone s plate bowl away or can i just take it without saying anything else i ve been told to serve from the left with my left hand where possible however at rectangle table this isn t always possible where i can t get between two people and have to serve from the right the same go for clearing plate taking them away i ve been told to do this from the right with my right hand which i try to do but it isn t always possible and often i have to clear from the left do people really care about this sort of thing if they can see it isn t possible i think i heard some people murmuring about me today in regard to which side i wa doing stuff

i worked at a restaurant with a dessert called strawberry limone and some guy told me that i wa stupid because it wa pronounced strawberry limousine because it wa in french it wa an italian restaurant
kinda a question story combo i used to manage a hotel that had a clear no party policy including child s birthday party loved that policy there wa a sign on the front desk that said that they had to initial it when checking in if you ve worked enough nye you know that some people rent hotel room to party in some incredible parent rent a room for their underage kid to party in and then just leave them in it to go get drunk themselves that hotel wasn t huge room but we had camera on every entrance exit on nye we would be very specific with incoming guest especially local where we told them that we don t allow party and if we discovered one they would be evicted st warning no money back at check in and then gave them the chance before they gave u their credit card the opportunity to cancel without penalty we had dozen of people change their plan with that method we also would be very watchful of our camera and if we saw a bunch of people coming in a back door with case of beer and all going to room we would have the person registered come to the front desk and let them know we are seeing that traffic and it would end with them being kicked out and give them the chance to vacate immediately before it got to that point all these rule of course came from past year where we had problem anyone else have any policy like this ready for tonight any story i ve never worked at a hotel where there wa separate security and the front desk always had to handle it
this happened a while back at the first hotel i worked at because of a burst water pipe in the outside part of the building the hotel wa experiencing a complete lack of water to make thing worse our general manager wa out of town that day and for whatever reason he wa not able to arrange for the burst pipe to be fixed in a timely manner i had to relocate most of our guest listen to infinite complaint apologise a million time make quite a few refund and had to face many angry guest shouting and cursing at me or asking me for some form of compensation it definitely wa a hell of a day so this just got me wondering what s the worst you ve had to deal with while working at the front desk what s the one day or shift you could look back to and hope you ll never have to go through something like that again

forever ago i worked at a dive bar on friday night now this particular bar is a bit odd an old biker bar that attracts a typically middle aged blue collar crowd but also frequently rent out the backroom for party ranging from quincenaras to rockbands anyways it is slow near closing with one semi regular and two other customer i ve never seen before some rough looking middle age white lady in baggy sweat and this guy who ha big fake teeth i named him gary busey teeth whom i can t understand a word out of his mouth i m the only employee after a couple beer the lady order a shot of johnny walker red when i inform her we don t carry red but johnny walker black she say i don t want no n bomb shot now if my description above didn t paint an accurate picture of the bar this place ha the look of one that you could get away with such thing even if it were which it isn t on my shift anyways the semi regular sitting with just one empty stool between them wa black i stare at her in disbelief for a second are you ing kidding me i ask a the consummate professional i am at this point she just happens to notice the other patron and proceeds to apologize profusely saying she wa just trying to be funny and didn t realize he wa there my regular aaron let s say wa more patient and understanding than he needed to be and wa like whatever it s fine i cut her off and let gary busey teeth finish his beer before they have to leave and think that s the end of it wrong well she and gary busey teeth start arguing which i can t really follow because i can t really understand him but escalates real fast and she stand up and punch gbt in the head gbt jump up and finally chooses this sentence to articulate clearly why are you hitting me on accord of this n bomb i tell them to gtfo but aaron is understandably beyond his limit and he and gbt start yelling at each other rough looking white lady doesn t appreciate not being the center of attention so she push up her sleeve whip out a razor blade and like slash doing a guitar solo windmill buries it into her own forearm like a cheap horror film i see the skin separate and for a beat it is just a gaping purple gash then the blood come i immediately call the police say i work at bar well known by police and this lady slashed her self with a razor she cut herself the black guy did not do it grew up in jersey during widespread racial profiling at this point aaron and gbt are face to face and don t see this and she is screaming at their back blood running down her arm and onto the floor i m worried she might slash at aaron with the blade still in her hand and grab her by the wrist from behind to restrain her while we await the police they get there like second later and the rest is a bit of a blur a i see this nutjob s blood all over my bar and me and what just happened catch up to me at this point i should mention that when she shoved up her sleeve i did notice there were dozen of scar and she wa well known to the police and the triage nurse i talked to at the hospital after i closed up lol after i explained why i wa there oh honey you re the one this happened to you don t have open wound you ll be okay i didn t immediately boot them a a few week before i had told a guy to get out after he wa stealing bubble from other patron and tacitly threatened me with violence for cutting him off and he knew the owner and it wa implied i should have just cut him off and not told him to leave
disclaimer i didn t work this night i heard it second hand so on valentine s day dinner my restuarant lost power around it became a disaster shortly after with the power out the vent couldn t get the smoke out of the kitchen so it started to go from the boh to foh and to the point it sat off our fire alarm meanwhile table didn t really care despite sitting in the dark someone complained it wa foggy someone complained it wa cold someone complained that the alarm were too loud eventually the power did come back about an hour later but the fire dept came and forced everyone out causing the restaurant to close an hour early a bunch of cook came the next day hoarse with sore throat from the smoke a good portion of table didn t pay and the main person who told me the story said i didn t know what to tell them besides the restaurant isn t working i thought it wa obvious part of me wish i had worked that night because i tend to push the envelope with my table really hard to begin with but i don t think i could have stayed in character in that situation the worst part apparently wa that the fireman weren t even hot

update at bottom of post okay so i m currently working front desk at a budget brand hotel i m working towards being promoted to mod so i m starting to pay much closer attention to what s going on at my hotel we are not an extended stay hotel we have a limit of week that a guest can stay consecutively after which they must be off property for hour then they are allowed to return i wa told that this is so no guest can establish residency if the guest is extending their reservation with u directly this is very easy to monitor because once a guest hit that day mark our system will not let u extend the guest out any further which is great the only issue is that if the guest make a reservation through an ota or even our reservation hit line a new reservation is made instead and to track it becomes an annoying process today i m working front desk my gm is gone for the day so me and my head housekeeper are going over everything she s got going on in the room we have a very limited amount of staff right now housekeeping is a bit of a revolving door but i m looking over at the stayovers board trying to make sure all of our stayovers that requested service had received it i noticed one room that said it had not been service for day which i immediately thought wa an error because i ve been getting a bunch of those today further more we have a rule that every day we have to get into a room to check for any damage or anything like that so even if the guest had requested no service we still go in and just check everything out replace towel if needed and that s that i dig deeper into it and found out that no it wa not an error and we had not been in the room for day and the same guest ha been registered to that room since august immediately i started printing out folio for each stay assuming that there just had to be a hour gap between these all somewhere and there wasn t after looking through my audit log and triple checking that none of these check in were done by me which none of them were thank god we called my gm and tried to explain the situation to which he responded thinking that i just decided to screw with him which i don t know why he d think that i don t really do joke and stuff but whatever basically i wa wondering what happens now this guest could totally establish residency if they wanted to but more importantly wouldn t we have to pay back any sale tax the guest paid since rent cannot be taxed and at this point he s pretty much a tenant isn t he just wondering if anybody else ha experienced something like this and what came of it edit hotel is in ohio not trying to put coworkers in a bad light genuinely curious a to what the hell happened will definitely be talking to gm and see what come of it and update update my relief gm and i tried multiple time to contact the guest no answer from the room or the phone number the guest provided we checked there wa a dog in the room so we contacted animal control explained the situation and asked if there wa anyone who could assist u just incase the dog wa aggressive it wa not thankfully the room wa a complete disaster dog poo and pee everywhere soggy dog food laying all over the floor etc blanket torn up some real nasty stuff going on in there we decided to completely gut the room while i wa working front desk calling at least time trying to get ahold of the guest my maintenance team removed everything from that room when i wa up there the smell wa so bad i wa curious a to how we have not been receiving complaint i checked the room status on the neighboring room never got one complaint about the odor hour into the room gutting the guest arrives furious which is i guess to be expected the dog wa taken by animal control all of his belonging were thrown in trash bag and tagged and available for him to pick up at the lobby we checked the guest out of the room and refunded the remaining night stay he had to the card a far a i m concerned i did everything within my power to help this guy yet i m the one there so i m the one getting yelled at basically the standard i ve been here this long already and had no issue why now because it s a violation of policy that went unnoticed till now i paid for that room you have no right to refund my money and kick me out we have the right to refuse rent or kick out anyone who violates our policy you had my dog taken away well if you woulda answered your phone this would of been handled differently also it clearly state in our pet policy animal are not allowed to be left unattended in a room without notifying the front desk of an emergency that would deem that acceptable i ve never signed any pet policy i cannot prove or deny that since we don t keep record so i hit him with the you ve also never stared at check in that you have a pet which is in direct violation of the policy that you electronically sign every time you come down to renew your reservation that surprisingly shut him up about the dog i never got a single call from you we ll then the number that you gave u for every reservation ha always been wrong and we have no way of knowing we tried everything we could even calling the ota that you booked through to see if they have an alternative way to contact you dude finally asks to speak with my manager so i paged the relief gm and they went at each others throat sheriff were called out and the situation finally started to dissolve a bit i had been informing my regular gm of everything that wa happening and he decided that he should come in and see if there s anything he could do luckily all the yelling and name calling dwindled down and my gm in the presence of law enforcement wa able to talk the the guest and basically tell him that we screwed up however he wa abusing that and knew that he wa in violation of policy that he wa refunded for the rest of the reservation and that if he would agree to just take the refund and leave that we would be willing to waive the damage to the room which he estimate to be well over the guest denied any damage equaling that amount to which my gm responded you have dog feces sitting in a room that s ventilating through our air duct and will require u to replace the entire side of the building literally every piece of furniture had to be trashed even the mirror because it s a biohazard on top of all the thing your dog chewed and clawed and for the loss of revenue for all the time that this room will be down for maintenance dude wa shocked i wa shocked i don t know the validity of that statement but it s possible and seemed to be enough to get the guest to agree obviously this isn t any sort of legal arrangement if he decides to sue u he still can however we will be having to take a lot of step to get this room rentable again at the end of the day we got the guest out of the room he got his dog back and he s currently staying across the street at a different hotel immediately after he checked in my gm called over to explain the entire situation to their gm so the same thing doesn t happen over there all in all one of the worse experience i have ever had and a i ve mentioned i deal with drug prostitution and death threat regularly all the staff sat down together and basically went over all the mistake that were made and what needed to be done to avoid this my gm chimed in that he would not be assigning fault to anyone however we are a corporate brand and that most likely he and the others involved will be getting let go but that ha yet to be determined because our district manager ha not commented yet hopefully this is the end of my it but i honestly doubt it i m pretty sure a few people will be losing their job and we re probably gonna get sued but until something happens this is the update sorry for the long rambling
tl dr my first hotel stay girl get embarrassed i get embarrassed thought a funny story might be good tonight when i wa about my parent took u all to a beach resort town for a week we were staying in a smaller boutique hotel the lobby and front desk were decorated in deep stained wood with brass and stained glass all around the lobby had leather chair and card table and a couple sofa to watch the tv back then there were regular channel and vhf there were no tv s in the room the staff wa pretty proper yes sir no sir etc but they were very nice my dad and i had left the room so mom and my sister could get ready and we were sitting in the lobby playing cribbage a teenage girl came in from the boardwalk and walked passed u and up to the desk i noticed because the girl looked close to my age and she wa wearing a yellow bikini dad stopped to watch me watch her a she stopped at the front desk the clerk asked if she could help her and she whispered an answer the clerk asked again and she leaned in and whispered again the clerkled asked a rd time and she whispered again the clerk wa an ancient gray haired old lady that looked like everyone s grandmother i think she either owned the hotel or someone in her family did the clerk apologized to the girl and she got ready to ask again the clerk leaned forward to hear her better the girl leaned in and just a the she went to answer the world got quiet you know those time where for a couple second it seems all sound and conversation stop at just that same time the girl got a little louder than she wanted and we all heard toilet paper please she knew a soon a it left her mouth that the whole lobby heard her her bright red skin wa a great contrast to her yellow bathing suit and she wa not sunburned she put her hand over her mouth gasped and took the roll of paper the clerk wa holding out for her she then ran up the step forgoing the elevator the clerk looked at u and said poor girl she s so embarrassed dad and i said why everyone s gotta go sometime we were still in the lobby when she came down probably about a half hour or more later mom wa slow she saw u and gasped when the elevator door opened we saw her and gave her a thumb up and said don t worry about it everyone s gotta go sometime right she said right and thanked u and ran out the door to the beach but it didn t end there we kept running into her and her friend the whole week we were there toilet paper became the joke and everyone joined in even the girl and her friend in fact they started it they d catch my dad and i in the lobby watching tv or playing card and she d see u and loudly ask u for toilet paper or we d be at an arcade or pizza stand and hear hey got any toilet paper she seemed pretty good natured about it one night i told her i wa never going to go again i wa going to hold it in until i exploded boy humor and she thought that wa the funniest thing she ever heard one night maybe half way through our stay mom and dad wound up meeting her parent and they had a good chuckle over the story i remember when mom and dad came up the room they said we met your girlfriend s parent it wa my turn to glow beet red i stuttered at mere mention of girlfriend it wasn t until the ride home that they explained to me that the girl thought i wa a few year older than i wa i wa a tall kid well over foot tall they told me that the girl had flirting with me but i wa clueless i just thought she wa funny and liked to smile
apology in advance the train of thought ran away from me and it got long the guest are fine and i make the most money out of everyone in my restaurant because of my attention to detail my guest are blown away that i bring them everything they need to package up thing to go that s how low the bar is but i just can t take my coworkers much longer the cook are great and for the most part management is too but the complaint i have seem to fall under the category of fight management doesn t feel like having so they re let go example server texting on their phone on the line not only when food need to be run but while they re actively using drink and food preparation station so phone in one hand while glass being filled with coke in the other so they get distracted with their phone and block access to station some server are even on their phone at the po station on the floor in front of guest i just hate seeing it when i dine out totally different if you can obviously tell they re on a break or off the clock and it just contributes to the server are lazy and feel entitled to for doing their basic job kind of mentality i don t know about you guy but even when it s slow there s always something that need refilling or stocking an old gm once told me it s a restaurant there s always something that need done when i started a a server you couldn t have your phone on you at all and anyone who needed to call during your shift wa allowed to have to restaurant number i get that we ve become more lax but you can tell these people aren t all texting their babysitter about their kid you know treating cook like crap i worked in kitchen granted that wa prep and dishwashing before i became a server but i never had to have anybody give me the tip to treat my cook well or get them a drink when it s busy not only am i the only server who offer without being asked by a cook first to get stuff for the cook but i also apologize sincerely when my mistake ringing stuff in cause an issue for the kitchen these instance are few and far between we have server who it really seems this way mess up by not ringing in modifier or side correctly for almost every table and have to come back and tell the cook for table i need x and on the blah no y for several table at a time and then get mad at the cook when they don t remember every single thing in between the time they are told and the food come up oh and no please or thank you to the cook either ever for anything then they talk to each other in front of the line but low enough that they can t be heard about how much the cook suck and how stupid they are server making their own floor plan or deciding they re not going to work a modified plan when we have callouts had this happen this weekend we had full coverage so enough server to pair everyone off for four section plus our bartender and their section this would have allowed everybody a good mix of large table and booth while splitting up the hard to seat high top but two of the server took it upon themselves to decide that they each wanted a section to themselves so they modified the floor plan to have five section screwing over the rest of the server who have partner one section wa now four high top and four four top booth between two server and manager didn t care or say anything to them server can denigrate guest call them cheap be outright racist and say they don t want insert ethnic group here table or refuse to take table without modifying rotation and i witnessed a server full on cuss out another team member and come to the back and brag about it and the mod just agreed with the server and yeah that person doe suck at their job don t they heh heh i m just burned out i m only there part time but it s only been recently that i dread going to work because of these attitude i can t afford to cut down my hour and honestly with my guest survey rate of completion and satisfaction score and everything i do for the restaurant they can t afford to lose me but i just can t do this anymore how do you start polishing up your skill to try and move to fine dining i m near the capital and thinking something higher end near dc might be a better fit for me is there a good resource for learning about wine and spirit and pairing do you focus on studying a type of cuisine i thought fine dining doesn t typically do the application process that say darden doe where you just click a link on a website so how do you find a job opening i ve been a server for about ten year and i m always looking to learn more and expand just need to know where to start and before anyone say anything i understand that it s possible that these are thing i will encounter at the next place i go to my hope is that management will see these thing a unprofessional a i m thinking fine dining would and try to avoid these thing specifically or at least address thing if they re not aware of them

single piece of blonde hair and there s lipstick on the toilet he casually brought up refund and a free night he wasn t screaming or anything just jumped into i want free i told him i don t get to decide that only gm and front desk manager do he started reallllyyyy pushing it i told him i ll ask he also booked through a booking agency and we don t refund booking agency reservation ever we don t charge the actual guest we charge the agency it didn t feel right it felt sketchy he talked weird typically if there wa an issue like that i would be screamed at he wasn t screaming at me it didn t feel right and it really made me uncomfortable i asked my head housekeeping about this and her eye went wide and said bull shit apparently she re checked the room yesterday if a room show vacant on her sheet and it s a arrival for the night she ll go in and re check the room and make sure it s all set and nothing wa forgotten a well a turn on the low heat for the guest she said the room wa perfect and none of that wa in the room when she checked it for his arrival the woman who cleaned it said that wa bull shit a well and they would remember something like that especially if a bag of urine wa found we consider that a bio hazard i called my gm and informed her about everything a well a what housekeeping said she said go into the room take picture look at what he found take somebody with me to have another witness she also said he will get no refund he can have a room move but no refund i called his room and informed him i need to go up and look at his claim he said no that s not needed take my word for it and give me my money back i told him none of that will occur until i look at his claim he sounded very nervous i went up with the maintenance man we looked around the room the room is trashed i just looked at my maintenance man with a straight face and mouthed why because he is clearly going to get charged an extra cleaning fee i asked where the bag of urine wa he said oh the bag of tea is over here he changed it to tea he said urine two very different thing i called him out on the random change of bag substance and he nervously laughed and said no you misheard no dude you said urine i asked you on the phone multiple time if it wa for sure urine you said it smelled like urine and wa yellow like urine i asked about the lipstick on the toilet he said it wa on the pillow not the toilet i called him out on that too he just laughed and showed me the pillow so i like make up i know what a lipstick smudge on a pillow look like the dude took a stick of lipstick and put line down the pillow with said lipstick i just stared at him and said well then i asked about the hair he showed me it i picked it up and it wa piece of doll hair i asked about the toe nail it wa a fake nail you get from the store for temporary use and it wa not blue it wa nude he also informed he stepped on it that s how he found it i asked where he found it i m not sure why he wa standing behind the couch to look for a fake nail but he did he also had just gotten out of the shower when we entered the room there were spot on the big full body mirror in the room he claimed they were there when he entered the room i don t think he expected me and the maintenance man to touch the spot but his eye went wide because they weren t dried mark they were obviously fresh it wa like he shook the water off his head and the water from his head landed on the mirror i told him he will be hearing a call from me downstairs after i talk to my gm he again began demanding a refund my maintenance man this time told him it s not for u to decide and we left with picture of everything he claimed i told the gm i think he wa trying to get a free room and she said he wa but failed the head housekeeper wa in the back yelling and cussing she wa pissed my gm said offer him a room move no money back let him know we know he s lying and to check the new room before going in case he try this again i called him and told him we can offer a room move that s it no refund he said alright and thanked me however i didn t say i know he wa lying i didn t want to start conflict he called me back minute later on the phone with the agency he booked through the man from agency said he need approval of a refund i asked what the hell is he talking about and the dude said i would give him one i told him i never ever said that and i would never give approval for a refund without a manager approval and the gm the woman that run the property did not approve of any refund he started yelling about how we re a disgusting hotel and that he will get his money back i told him he can take that up with my gm and he is more then welcome to come down to the lobby and get her work card he yelled he would and would be coming to the desk to give me a piece of his mind and hung up it wa about hour later my housekeeper called and asked if he left or what he left without giving me a piece of his mind or getting the card for my gm head housekeeper said everything he claimed he found in the room wa gone besides the trash he left behind and the lipstick he put on the pillow

tonight during our pre shift our service manager started talking about our attitude and always having a smile on our face which i understand a lot of u have been down and grumpy for the passed couple of week due to a number of reason i work at a fairly busy restaurant and weekend hit u hard mostly due to the fact that our kitchen absolutely cannot keep up we re talking min for appetizer an hour for entree etc and because of this we are growing a customer base of people who think they can walk in and eat for free if they complain enough this ha been going on for a couple month now and it s been affecting our money badly on top of that most of our manager including the one i ll be talking about here either don t do anything and just micro manage yell at people for no reason etc not the best situation but anyway i guess our service manager wa trying to motivate u to be happier which is fair but we are all a pretty happy bunch to begin with but it s hard when thing go to shit every single shift but anyway she say this y all i ve been going out to dinner a lot lately with my fianc and let me tell you if our server come up and isn t happy or doesn t have a personality they ve ruined our meal and we give them hell after that the server set the ambiance we all nearly snapper our neck when we heard that maybe i m just overreacting but why would you say that to motivate a group of server to be happiest why would you openly admit that you give your server hell if they re not happy enough for you she wa a server before she wa a manager and she witness the shit we go through on each shit she s seen u break down because of how customer have treated u and she just basically admits she doe that too it s hard to bounce back and be happy when you re night is shitty even though we all try to be our best but i guess she doesn t care about that because the server just ruined the ambiance of her date this made me pretty mad but i admittedly already have a problem with this manager due to her pettiness and how she treat worker she doesn t like i also understand from a customer point of view it s a little off putting to have a server that clearly in a bad mood but you don t have to make it worse by giving the hell ya know you don t know what shit they ve gone through that day or that week they re only human this manager literally went from trifling bitch to thunder c nt in two second what are your thought
what title say my friend told me that s a big red flag a they made me feel bad for even asking my manager got mad had an attitude for me asking i called on the phone a i wa on my break for college and my bf also said the same i explained my parent had this family day out at the beach they said no a i m the only hostess it ll be hard to find someone to replace that my bf basically said they threatened to fire me if i do take that day off mind you i work at a fine dining italian place so eh idk yes i am the only hostess idk why they only have one host and like bussers but it s whatever i get tip what server make so it like in total the day i come in i also work friday and sat night so my weekend are gone lol another situation wa when i let them know i might not be able to come in at my original time a i have to drive back hour with traffic on friday after school and they got mad i literally told them during my interview i go to school m w f idk why they still fucking scheduled me but they worked around it so i now come in at rather than lol and i wa thinking of quitting i literally have no time for school and noticed this week ago
so this happened back in may but i needed some time to calm down before posting i work at a top tier hotel in manhattan normally a high class crowd a our room rate can be a night depending on season i m working the front desk and this guy come in he is visibly intoxicated very good looking and well dressed but drunk for sure he asks to check in i don t have a reservation and it turn out it wa for day before we had charged him a a no show he really can t get this so he end up going on a tirade saying he had reserved the room open ended he doesn t understand such a thing doesn t exist we are sold out he proceeds to throw a tirade in the lobby and pick up a trash can and throw it across the lobby striking some art on the wall and a child who wa just hanging out with his parent i had enough and call the cop they came and after hearing the story they took him away i thought that wa the end of it but next day we get a call from central and this guy being a diamond for life had complained my gm agreed to refund the charge pay the court cost and write an apology note in retrospect i should have accommodated him but wasn t thinking clearly it s done now he stay every few week with no issue but just wanted to share my story
someone just used this on me because our shuttle wasn t running due to the holiday we re le than occupancy so it make no sense to staff a driver when no one going to be using it i tell him that but he still go off about how he spends so much money at our brand s hotel and that we owe him a paid for cab ride and i know for a fact he can expense cab ride to his company because he s told me before that he can he just like the convenience of our shuttle being ready immediately so he can expense it but he d rather bitch to me and demand a free cab ride just because he want to feel special i hate when elite member say this in response to me not catering to their petty demand they always pretend like i owe them something because their company pay for them to stay with u i always laugh a little when they say how much i spend here when they re not even the one spending the money it the company and these are the same people who bitch and moan about having to spend on a bottle of water lol what happened to all the money you spent here then they ll complain that they aren t allowed to take a cold bottled water from the market whenever they want because of their elite status nothing make me more angry than entitlement update this jackass just came through the lobby grabbed a beer from the fridge and told me he s taking this to make up for u not providing a shuttle for him he didn t ask he told me i wouldn t have given it to him either way but now i m just pissed off even more that he just demanded free alcohol from me i don t even need to get in to how our conversation went afterwards but it wasn t pleasant
feel free to delete if this shouldn t be here i no longer work in a hotel but i am frequently in contact with hotel while working at a travel agency before we book hotel or any other type of accommodation we are required to state the cancellation policy or risk being written up cancellation policy are hotel policy and hotel have the right to abide by them no matter the circumstance i have had multiple client this past week call in asking to cancel their hotel reservation inside the cancellation policy when i tell there will be a penalty they all say they ve had a medical emergency death in the family and beg me to speak to the hotel i tell them it s not a guarantee they ll waive anything and i ask if they purchased travel insurance they all say no but they ask me to please speak to the hotel and that a a super special triple platinum hotel loyalty member repeat guest planning to spend with them in the future all actual response i ve gotten the hotel will have to let them cancel at no penalty so this ha resulted in a conversation with a mix of reservation and front desk agent at multiple hotel conversation below is typically how these conversation have gone i am so sorry if you happen to be one of the people i spoke to over the phone ha hotel agent collective entitled client ec ha thank you for calling luxury hotel this is ha me hi this is emerald avenger from myplaceofworktravelagency i am calling on behalf of my client ec they have a reservation for today and they would like to cancel ha we can cancel their reservation but they will have a penalty me i am so sorry to all you front desk and reservation agent i understand however ec wa really looking forward to staying at your property and they re part of your hotel loyalty program but there s been a medical emergency and they will no longer be able to stay at your property is there anything you can do to waive the cancellation penalty by medical reason ha understandably sounding slightly annoyed we have to abide by hotel cancellation policy i m sorry to hear that but we can t bend policy me i see let me get back to my client and confirm that they will proceed with cancelling me back to ec thank you for holding i spoke with ha and they can cancel it if you want but there will be a penalty of because it s a last minute cancellation ec what no get back on the phone right now please get them to see reason we ll send medical document something we can t afford to pay the penalty listen i feel bad because medical bill are horrendously high in the u s even with health insurance at the same time these are mostly well off client who should ve bought travel insurance me i am sorry but this is hotel policy not the agency s policy ec well if the hotel brand want our continued business they better waive the penalty and a your client we expect you to fight on our behalf me against better judgement but knowing they could give me a bad survey that will tank my osat would you me to ask to see if management will review your case if you send medical document ec yes please do and we ll leave you a good survey if you get the fee waived they won t but they ll leave me a bad one if the hotel stick to their gun me back to ha thank you for holding ec is willing to send medical document would there be anyway management waive the cancellation penalty if they have document proving there wa a medical circumstance preventing their stay i know it s not a guarantee but they re willing to do anything and they re not willing to let this go i m sorry not said they re gonna leave me a negative survey if i don t pressure you to provide a solution ha sounding somewhat sympathetic a i ve stated earlier the cancellation policy is what it is but this is management s email and i can make a note that there s been a medical emergency and property management will review the case the email is me to ec the email they provided me is it s still not a guarantee but management may give approval if you show you have a legitimate medical circumstance if you would like to cancel you ll still pay the penalty ec cancel it but they better refund u back hang up to all you front desk and reservation agent i know you deal with a lot and you probably don t appreciate a travel agent calling during your busy check in period begging you on behalf of their client to cancel a reservation last minute

hey reddit first time poster here hope i m following the guideline i m a waitress at a restaurant and we often have family with little child come in i live in france where people aren t too into gender binary so more often than not child will be dressing a they please which i personally think is great but it s a bit difficult to identify especially since they re child who s a girl and who s a boy the problem is i often address the little one a little lady or little dude and often make the mistake of mixing them up most reaction i get from parent are quite negative and cold which make me feel terrible there s no equivalent to my knowledge for little buddy in french and little one is usually gendered la petite le petit ha anyone encountered this problem and if so how did you manage it also if any french speaker have an idea of a gender neutral way to address kid that d also be great
is anyone else getting hardly any shift because of how slow business ha been this month i m thinking about finding another job because of how slow it ha been but i m at a place that i like and i would rather stay
maybe this doesn t fit the criterion for this sub but i thought it would be most appreciated here after i commented on a video on another sub showing you how to fold a dollar to look like you tipped more i wa called a c t for saying if you can t afford to tip your shouldn t be eating out apparently the idea of paying your server is wildly outrageous and it s ok to snub paying server because some people don t make a lot but still want to treat themselves and i m high for thinking server deserve to be tipped regardless i never thought i d ever have to actually argue that server are people that deserve compensation for their time and labor i would have loved to link but post wa just deleted but it really highlighted that a lot of people do not view server a having real job and that some people view their labor a being an option to pay ha anyone else ever encountered insanity like this before like why is it ok to walk into an establishment and have no problem paying for the meal that a chef just worked hard to make you but at the same time not be ok with paying the person who brought you the food kept your drink full and then cleaned up your mess sorry had to vent
i m a little new to the hospitality industry starting a part time na to full time anyways in the short time i ve been doing this i ve had several awesome even amazing guest come through but the one that just checked out a few minute ago made the two day he wa here legitimately enjoyable i m actually going to miss him he said he s going to stop by the next time he s in town and i really hope he doe it s not that often a guest will keep you company in the wee hour of the morning to help time fly and actually enjoy it
just joking definitely going to tip we are travelling to hawaii in a few week and we live in a non u non tipping country however the u obviously doe so i want to make sure we get it right we also went last year but found a couple of thing a bit confusing restaurant is the standard and then over and above for extra good service is that what you would expect take out if you order takeout from say cheesecake factory or the like do you also tip here if so how much edit a in order online and go to the shop to pick it up i know this one is stupid but it give me anxiety lol do i ask for the cheque or wait for them to bring it also we usually are always paying in cash if the bill is say and we leave in the folder thing obviously not wanting change can we then just leave or are we suppose to wait for server to come back if the service is bad do we still tip do you reduce it at all thank you apology if this isn t appropriate for this sub
so i am sure everyone on this community ha had to deal with the backlash of giving somebody a complimentary upgrade and them being annoyed at you well this wa a new one for me i am working the night shift at my property not audit we just close late and we had check in left at pm luckily of the arrived just a i wa going to close the pool and the third had called back saying she wa minute away the guest who wa still headed to our property wa originally booked in one of our standard room by suckspedia when she arrived i told her that she got a complimentary upgrade from the basic room to one of our suite she gave me a weird look and i wa expecting to be yelled at because the basic room wa her absolute favorite and she only wanted that but she started complaining stating that she had originally booked one of the suite not the basic room i explained to her that it not a problem since we didn t charge her extra for the room change and we put her in a room that she wanted but she insisted on having me sit there for minute while she fished through her email trying to find the original confirmation to show me that she booked the suite that once again she wa going to stay in anyways well ten minute pas and i have already written note about the interaction in her reservation since my manager is insistent on having u document every single interaction we have with guest well low and behold she found the email and what did it say you ask well of course it said you have reserved a standard room she went red in the face and wa explaining how it wa her company fault and she only wanted to stay in the suite and she wa going to pay extra to have one of those room i told her again that we gave her a complimentary upgrade to the suite so she wa going to be in one regardless sorry for the horrible structuring i wa just trying to write everything before i forgot

i ve been working in hospitality for year now and i ve observed a common theme people wholly and completely believe they deserve more than they paid for if they happen to see there s a little left in the bottle i m pouring from i live in a country where alcohol is very expensive nz and employer insist on mitigating cost by using every last drop of wine or spirit poured from a bottle everything is measured to a t and sliding drink is either kept strict track of or forbidden entirely so when i pour ml of wine into a glass and someone see that ml or so is left in the bottle they ll say go on i can drink that or the like it really fuck me off to no end if you ve paid for ml of wine mate that s what you re fucking getting one particularly despicable cunt decided to pack a sad and very loudly because i measured a shot of sloe gin and there wa about ml aka a single shot left in the bottle well i can t believe he s going to leave that in the bottle karen mutter to her friend sharon i happily ignore this a i top her drink with soda go on mate i ll finish that she garbbles a her third chin swing to and fro oh are you paying extra i yell out louder than her of course so a to assert dominance hsg sg jand b no she exerts her face twisted into a somehow even more disturbing car wreck than before well then never mind i sung smiling a i plunked the cork back in the bottle shazza let out a muffled laugh a she brought her hand to her mouth in an attempt to grab the sound of her pity and drag it back into her throat karen on the other hand wa not impressed the car wreck turned to a train wreck and she wa all like wow and stormed off tldr angry karen get booboo on ego cuz mean man won t give her well deserved alcohol for free edit because people are asking why alcohol is expensive in new zealand i ll give a little insight the country a a whole ha about the same population a los angeles million this make for a le than competitive economic market a a whole on top of that you ve got a whole heap of tax on alcohol sale importing duty to custom and law that state you cannot sell alcohol for anything under above cost this is intended to mitigate damage to individual and community due to alcohol abuse all of that together make for vvv exspensy drink unless you re in queenstown where jagermiester is viewed a a healthier alternative to water

i ve worked a a server for almost year at a restaurant that did a paying system in a different way the customer didn t pay at the table they pay upfront with the hostess so when they tipped on credit card and not cash we d wait until the end of our shift to collect our tip from the manager the money come from the drawer register when we clock out we claim of our sale and not cash tip i started at a new server job at a different restaurant with a different paying system customer pay at the table with card or cash most of the time i get credit card tip which is taxed and recorded exactly how much i am getting do i claim all of those credit card tip when i clock out or can i only claim i know i m supposed to claim cash tip a well but i never have just what wa given to me on credit card we also tip out bussers and bartender so the tip that is on credit card doesn t all go towards me basically my question is do i claim all tip at the end of the night or is it just cash tip based on my sale wouldn t that mean it get taken out of my paycheck when i make a big amount server min wage in my state is

just a note to all server manager if you let customer do extravagant modification to their dish even if you let them know that you can do it just this once or the kitchen is slow today it should be fine they will ask for it every single time and then they ll be upset at any other server manager who doesn t do it for them and all the other server kitchen people will not be happy do something once and they ll most definitely ask for it again and again
i helped this caller find our website but i couldn t help wondering how the hell he d found our number in the first place presumably with the internet shame you can t just say just google it
i work in a kind of small hotel room our hotel ha superior room and they re twin and double of course twin room are a bit cheaper because people want them le so person book a twin room and asks for the bed to be together i check our availability and sure enough and more usually double room available i message them telling that if they want a double room they can book a double room a we have them available for their date they usually message u back can t you just do it isn t that much just book the damn double end of rant it just grind the hell out of my gear
i came into the hotel this morning and saw chunk of glass scattered throughout the lobby wtf happened on a monday night in march first drunk guest stumbled into the lobby around am and wa being disruptive so our night auditor who is about week new to our team diffused the situation and kept them from disturbing our other guest eventually drunk guest wa ready to go to their room and our night auditor escorted them up drunk guest couldn t find the room key so they came back down to the lobby to make a new one when they got back down to the lobby a second drunk guest and partner were pounding on the lobby door because they were locked out night auditor let them in and couldn t find their reservation later we found out they were booked at a different shmoliday bin across town of freaking course drunk guest started arguing with our night auditor cussed him out shouted racial slur and punched our poor night auditor then drunk guest freaked out threw a glass top coffee table across the lobby picked up large shard and proceeded to throw them that s when the police arrived and arrested drunk guest but guest ran off with no coat and no shoe never thought anything like this would happen at our hotel especially on a monday night
so i ve been waiting table forever and finally got around to rewriting my r sum it just seems so repetitive and boring how do you jazz up your r sum
hey talesfromthefrontdesk i m back again to close out the story of the family i posted about here firstly and most importantly the family is gone a of a week now i am free i may or may not have been listening to this on repeat for the past week now gather round for the terror they inflicted upon u humble desk worker for three month i shared the advice i received in the first thread with my coworkers including my fom we were all in agreement but no one wa really taking action until one day when i came in after a crappy night s sleep decided i didn t want an entire nd shift of roblox noise and shrieking swearing and disconnected the router cable for our business center in our server room i put on my best acting of gosh i don t know what could have possibly gone wrong there i don t know anything about computer when the dad came by to ask about them the eldest kid waited in the lobby all night waiting for them to be fixed but it wa just him and he did it quietly so i had a peaceful shift for once word spread and my first shift coworker put up a sign on each computer stating they re out of order and that the desk can handle any printing scanning need for guest we were determined to hold out until their original checkout date this happened around new year s and they were due out within a week they were in a constant battle with their insurance company to extend however and so i got to meet the mother for the first time by meet i mean she came up to the desk a if she needed something then whipped out her phone and proceeded to scream and curse at the insurance company while maintaining full eye contact with me the entire time mfw she got off the phone asked wa i too mean or not mean enough and i made some vague sound in my throat intended a a noncomittal answer she wa angry because they wouldn t cover a second room for the family and wa determined to sue them now bear in mind the family had a room with two queen bed and a pullout couch so the insurance s company logic wa probably adult couple share one bed then with three boy ranging in age from y o to two of them could share one large bed what the insurance company wasn t accounting for wa the parent s relationship up until that point mom had been choosing to stay in their burned house rather than be around the dad and we got to witness multiple instance of the mom hanging out in the lobby on the phone with the dad who wa up in the room saying thing like i fucking hate you you piece of shit bastard etc and witnessed by my first shift i ll just go home and kill myself on one occasion she did this song and dance in the lobby in front of me and one of her son and proceeded to storm out of the lobby leaving him there housekeeper also stated that on the occasion that they were let into the room which wa starting to look like an episode of hoarder that the mom and dad would frequently be having nasty fight with each other with all the child present and waving the housekeeper to just continue cleaning a if nothing wa going on she then got to one of my part time coworkers when none of u were there yelling at them that she knew we were keeping the computer off and how dare we deny her boy their right to go on them intimidating my coworker enough that she plugged the router back in and we had to deal with the boy yet again we were starting to get bad salt score and complaint mentioning the boy constantly on the computer using foul language and screaming around the time that it felt like we were all getting to a breaking point the dad bought the three of them laptop and we were mercifully spared from dealing with all three boy at once however one would usually be sent down to play on his own which tie into this after witnessing both of the parent in all their glory i pulled my fom aside and said that despite not being mandated reporter it really felt like we had a duty to call cps she informed me that cps wa already involved with the family and that they had actually mandated that middle child and eldest child who usually were the biggest source of screaming fight when they were down together were mandated by cps to not speak play or be around eachother so back to the earlier point of mom wanting an extra room it suddenly made sense to me that she wanted an extra room probably to facilitate separating the boy except they hadn t been keeping them separate for month and despite suddenly having the separate room we ended up getting a noise disturbance reported from a room next to them they were being so loud thing being hit thrown so heavily that the room next door s bed wa being shaken my fom called the non emergency police line a move i agree with she wa there all by herself and there s no way to know if it wa mom v dad dad v mom or parent v kid etc well mom came storming down and ripped into my coworker accusing her of calling the police on her son who have autism threatening legal action etc she checked out their extra room then and there thank god my fom wa pretty upset and worried that she d done something wrong which i assured her anyone would make the same call i wa proven right a their real no more extension check out date finally approached we knew that the room wa going to be a shithole once they finally cleared out and were prepared to take it out of order and spend a good few day deep cleaning it the dad despite knowing their coming check out date well in advance basically did nothing to clear it out he got permission from the gm to clear the room out over the weekend a cleaning wouldn t start until the next monday i wa very careful to give key that were only valid for a few hour every time he came because i suspected he would happily take a weekend away from those kid his wife well he d been tooling around in the room for a few hour after i made him key and i wa in the lull between checkout at and check in at suddenly a guest came running in with a phone to his head informing me that he wa calling the police dad had brought kid with him and left them in the car unattended for hour including the two boy who aren t supposed to be around each other he wa out there his one kid screaming while he yanked him around by the arm police came and went saying it wa settled i can t help but judge harshly my brother s on the spectrum growing up i saw my fair share of meltdown but my parent would employ bear hug soothing physical contact not throw him around pick him up etc and so that s that they re out now and i m relieved from my first post my frustration lay mostly with the kid a we were dealing with the brunt of their behaviour and didn t see much of the parent witnessing both of the parent up close and personal for month now i just feel sorry for those kid i wish i could rename my previous title two big terror but i wanted to share this experience something unlike anything i ve dealt with in about a year and a half of hospitality work i ve dealt with rude people angry people i ve had guest make me cry but nothing ever like this this close this tale out in term of finishing their story with me and i m glad that my work ha returned to normal and i m dealing

okay so firstly i m still kinda new to serving been in restaurant for year but only been serving for so i might have been able to handle this better but it got me fuming i had a huge party yesterday and they tipped and treated me like crap and left with a few of their credit card slip so i had to them out so i wa kinda burned out on party today got sat a that turned into a that s fine they re at different table for adult and one big one for the kid ranging from anywhere between it seemed one of the adult table tell me when i ask that their whole table will be on one ticket and i say great a i m asking the kid who will be paying for them or who might be paying for themselves one of them maybe or say he ll be with his mom who s sitting at the table that will all be on one check i say great the service actually go pretty smoothly they re polite and understanding when the kitchen take a minute because we got slammed after desert a few of them including the mom and her son get up and leave a i m handing out the check lady from the table who s all on one check come up and say hi i m sorry but i didn t order these chicken tender me oh yes one of the gentleman from that table said that he wa going to be part of your bill lady um well im the one paying so you really should ve asked me who wa it me uhh the kid in the black jacket i m pretty sure he just left lady well you really should ve asked me i m the one paying i even told you that she didn t this is unprofessional that table ended up stiffing me and that entire table glared dagger in my direction until they all got up and left the rest tipped okay but not enough to make up for a stiff on a tab i m so done with big party honestly i ll make sure to be asking who s paying and confirming who s on their ticket from now on but honestly if you can t communicate with your party i don t think i should be the one getting yelled at at the server station and with how quick the guy wa to get up and leave i kinda wonder if he knew that it wouldn t go over well he had seemed kinda dodgy when saying who s check he d be apart of earlier
our department range from year old and there s about of u somehow our department ha become the worst department due to the attitude and action of several of the staff mind you these are the same staff member that apparently want to be a server but don t want to do any of the legwork go get there these are also the same staff member who constantly call out and when they re giving le shift practically bully you into giving you your shift this is mostly the year old bullying the others and then the older staff feel the need to put them in their place resulting in a divided department where you re required to pick a side this is a fucking restaurant it is a place to make money and pay the bill or for the very few it s their future career and where they want to be this ain t high school this isn t a playground this isn t a competitive sport it s a job to make end meet our department also ha a new manager this manager ha done diddly squat to improve or even slightly change the dynamic in our group why because they want to focus on the other three department they decided to oversee versus the other manager who only see maybe department we re not united our team suck and some of u acknowledge it it s so chaotic end rant
so i work at a kind of eclectic burger bar we re owned by a company that operates other restaurant that are more traditional but we have our own menu and focus a lot more on rotating beer tap and cocktail my manager who hired me wa literally the best manager i ve ever worked under super busy lunch he s out on the floor seating people bussing table making drink running food could even hop on the grill if he needed to if we were super busy he would even call u all over to the well to give u a shot or something to keep u laughing and mellowed out he left because of a pay dispute in my opinion they should ve given him whatever he wanted and we got the worst manager ever this guy is a total hippy burnout loser but is also kind of a bro if that make sense first thing he doe is hire on his and his wife s girlfriend a a hostess and she is just the worst ever literally had to explain to her what a rotation wa but he is literally the laziest person i ve ever worked for he cut host and server hour so now we re expected to seat bus serve and run food on a skeleton staff to a place that get insane rush lunch because we re located next to major office building in my city if he s in the restaurant which is rare for him to actually show up he literally will watch u drown while he drink craft beer with rep at the bar or go to the office to make the schedule and say he s too busy to help he spends time making the schedule oh no i literally don t get my schedule for the next week until sunday and our old manager used to do it three week in advance he always is trying to talk about his tattoo which are pretty shitty or just go into the parking lot to smoke weed once even told me i smelled too much like cigarette and he reeled of weed he also changed the restaurant entire vibe by trying to make u wear a uniform but let s his favorite get away with wearing whatever they want also he wa pretty drunk at noon one day and bragged to me about how much money he make which is just the trashiest thing i can imagine given our old manager left for a salary dispute he ha denied my request off for a few day because i have a trip i ve planned forever for a friend s wedding and i told him i would be across the country he tell me if i don t show up i ll be fired even though i m the guy who always train new hire bartends serf know the menu more than anyone else etc i m not showing up and i think i ll tell the corporate owner just how terrible he is if i get fired thought update i did it i used linkedin to find the bos above my manager s bos s email and told him the whole thing since we ve always been friendly also told him that i would be leaving without notice a i just got offered a position that want me to start in two week and i want a week to center myself this is a job where i can use my degree and i m pretty excited about it in a perfect world i d be able to stay on and pick up shift on weekend to supplement my income but we roll with the punch i m hoping that this guy get removed quickly and my former now coworkers life get easier i honestly don t feel guilty because service industry is all about teamwork at every level and this guy either forgot about that or just doesn t care thanks for all the advice and i hope you guy have the best manager wherever you re currently or will work

allow me to tell you a tale of the ultimate exercise in futility i m writing this from houston texas very recently some poor shmuck just doing his job gently grazed a year old water main that decided now is the time and much like rita repulsa emerging from her moon prison this fucker just go with it flood an entire section of a hiway and manages to pollute the water for the entire city of houston area which is laughably large school shut down major traffic reroutes the work i my dear friend happen to work in a coffee shop a coffee shop that can not make coffee tea or literally any drink because we don t have clean water we also can t use any of our cleaning chemical or do dish because again no water we also can t wash our hand because we have no water i bring these point up to my store manager insert then perish meme a the brilliant solution is to send someone to get hand sanitizer at pm they ran the whole morning and no one brought this up send one of my guy to go get some half an hour and store later he come back with a travel sized bottle that he found wedged behind a shelving unit that someone must have knocked off because everyone in the metro area ha hit max hysteria bos say that s fine ask what exactly we are meant to accomplish a closer whose job it is to clean the store which wa not set up and can not be cleaned due to yet again not having fucking water just clean what you can with disposable sanitizer wipe and do training one person had two thing they needed trained on minute well wasted clean the only thing we can really clean minute top can we close early no can i send someone home early no customer are more upset that we are open and not serving them than if we were just closed well just focus on making the customer experience and engaging with them we didn t get past unfortunately we can t make any drink before being cursed at and people driving off i tried to shut down the bathroom because we didn t have clean water for people to wash their hand with bathroom dont have a reliable way to unlock them from the outside post a sign declaring that our bathroom are unavailable due to the contaminated water customer approach stop read sign go in anyway hour of this who need a drink
this happens way too often you ll have a great table nice and warm and eager to try lot of food and drink good small talk etc you give them the bill they sign it enthusiastically and leave with hearty goodbye you review the check they ll leave a generous tip on a bill but in the total line they ll write they meant to tip over but added up the number wrong still a good tip either way but it s frustrating
i just found this sub and i worked a a night auditor many year ago and i have several story from that time about week into me working there a wedding party stayed with u and they were told by the gm that they weren t allowed to drink in the lobby outside or in their room only so the day of the wedding they were partying all that night a middle aged woman wa completely shit faced and kept trying to get me to come up to her room she told me her room important later she keep trying to hit on me for about hour when she finally stopped she came through the lobby with a man on her arm that wa just a drunk a she wa half way through they stopped and he asked me if i d come to her room with them and hold the camera i politely declined obviously then later on through the night i haven t seen them again but a group of jock ish type are all wasted coming through the lobby all snickering and talking about that same room number then the rest of the night wa just uneventful the next night i come in and i m talking to the nd shift guy and he wa telling me about the day and how crazy housekeeping wa and then he proceeded to tell me that they had to throw away a mattress because it had a ft wide puddle of blood soaked in it i asked which room it wa and it wa her room i honestly don t know what happened or if she survived but i like to think it wa just a messy train lol
i work at a pretty busy restaurant and i have never in my life experience a kitchen that wa so impossible to talk too for example anytime i ask for something simple on the the fly the chef say oh go fuck yourself you fucking asshole lare you kidding me right now a if i am in control of the fact that somebody want aioli and then the chef is such a grumpy old man that when it start to even get a little bit busy we are talking like five ticket in the window he start yelling screaming and throwing thing he is the executive chef of an open concept kitchen where guest can clearly hear him yelling a fine dining restaurant and this guy is screaming into the dining room profanity i swear he get so angry that the entire line start to get stressed out and then they start screaming and yelling too saying fuck front of house like no the problem isn t front of house it s your shitty leader with a shitty attitude you accidentally make an error or you make a tiny thing wrong on your ticket he start screaming it s gotten to the point where i m ready to just walk out and quit what do you think about this have you ever worked with a kitchen that wa impossible where the divide between front of house and back of house wa so intense that you couldn t even ask for simple thing like fucking ketchup
this will be kind of short so if this doesn t count a a tale i pre apologize about minute till the end of my shift right now a man i checked in earlier come up to the desk gt man how are you tonight gt gt me i m doing great how are you gt gt man i m fine thanks for asking he then just stare at me without saying anything and without even blinking i assume we ve just begun a starring contest so i stare back and eventually ask how i can help him to which he doesn t say anything he just continues to look me right in the eye and say nothin i do not blink few second in he blink i win and finally he let me know he want to extend his stay for room a very weird situation but a situation i feel like i ve won thanks for reading
hey all let me tell you about the time literally a week ago these people from an old hotel job i had visited me and requested me to be their server a little back story i worked at this fancy smancy hotel a an in room dining server i absolutely hated every single manager and coworker in my department and would regularly go and talk to the house keeping manager because they were really nice and our office were in the same area and they understood my frustration with brad my evil as manager i eventually got another job at this fine dining restaurant and they offered me a hosting position and said i could move up to a server after two month i gave the hotel job a notice saying i would be quitting in a few week once im a server and they laughed and straight up told me it wouldnt happen when i eventually did get moved up i gave them a three day notice because fuck them anyways a year later i see the house keeping department made a reservation at my new job and requested me for their holiday party im excited im sharing the party with someone else and it all one bill everything is going perfect i ended up mainly taking the party myself but whatevs their bill wa almost for people so i knew we d get tipped well not we get the bill back there wa one for drink and one for food and there wa a tip on each i wa livid i couldnt believe this terrible place wa now fucking me over at my new place but i wa mostly hurt that the people i thought i wa close with and seemed so excited to see me would do that to me i asked my manager if it would be okay to message my friend in the group and ask what the fuck happened my manager is dope and she said id only get in trouble if they complained to the gm who is a scary but great lady and i wa willing to risk it so i played it cool i messaged my friend and asked how her dinner wa and eventually asked what we could have done better because i wa afraid we did something wrong she said no it wa amazing and they will be back again i said great i wa worried because adam tipped u and i wa confused she replied back that adam wa so embarrassed and thought that on each bill would make total and he would drop off an envelope of cash to the restaurant the next day being assertive got u an extra each i know isnt much but it wa a slower night and this party wa one of three of my table that night we walked away with each after tip out and i only made le than that night tl dr don t let people you know fuck you over
so i posted a couple of day that i worked for day at a shitty hotel that wa owned by a patel family no i m not being racist in this case it literally wa their last name and one of the myriad of reason is i wa being sexually harassed there on my second or third day i met this guy we ll call him chet he only worked there time a month usually but for some reason this glorious place i had started working at ha a high turn over rate anyway chet usually work at one of their other property and they only call him in for emergency which apparently my entire time working there wa one emergency after another because i d walk in to do the am shift and there would be chet i never ever learned this guy s last name but i can tell you all about his sex life since that s all he would talk about bondage swinging threesome with his ex and her new boyfriend you name it chet did it chet wa a biiiig dude nothing wrong with being any weight at all but of course you get picture in your head and you start wondering what the hell the other people look like but i literally just met this guy and minute later we re talking about the time he sucked his ex wife s new boyfriend s dick you think you feel uncomfortable so i left that hotel in september tonight i m in the deli doing my thing and i had my head down putting some ham back in the case at my deli we have to wear a ball cap and i ve started wearing glass full time since i left the hotel so i m sure when i said i ll be right with you to the belly i saw through the glass in the meat case he didn t know who i wa i got out of the case and looked up and said how can i help you it didn t register with me at first that this wa chet but oh boy he remembered me uhhh i ll come back later and he dragged whatever unfortunate creature he had with him over to the oscar meyer section and bought his deli meat there it wasn t actually until he got to that section of the store that i realized who he wa and i honestly couldn t stop laughing for clarification the hotel we both worked at wa in a city about minute away from where my store is i forgot this idiot lived out here but i didn t forget what he told me his dad said about it s not gay if you re the one throwing guess he ll be shopping in the next city over from now on for his deli need lol
and this may cost me a large amount of cool point uggggghhhhhhh i hate having problem on my shift but for the last week or so i ve actually had no problem at all in fact it s been relatively quiet my shift report are usually very long because they are very detailed even to the point of my own detriment i put in everything that each person involved ha said every action and my thought it s verbally animated and my co worker have told me they look forward to reading them lol well tonight is a doozy first i came in early and didn t even start reading my pas along email until after my shift started i had just clicked on the one that i needed to read for this particular guest when they walked in they had booked for a double queen suite but we were out i didn t realize this either until after the fact i wa just zoned out this evening because i usually do all of this at the very start of my shift well the mr give me her name and tell me that they have already been checked in and are just needing to pick up key for their two room okay sure simple enough right but wait she or the mr then say it s a room with a rollaway bed or a pull out sofa right i tell them no i have two room for you one is a king and one is a standard queen no pullout sofa but i ll upgrade you a suite he or she tell me no we called and spoke to another associate who ha already upgraded u we just need to pick up the key sure but if you need a room with a pullout that s not this room i m just letting you know no no but we booked a hold on let me just find the confirmation email the mr while the mr is trying to find the confirmation mr is gearing up for a battle that i m not ready for mr is saying that it s after midnight it wa pm but close enough and that they were already checked in and why am i making this so difficult i told him that i wasn t but i wanted them to know that they are not in the room they booked if they need a pull out sofa bed the mr found the confirmation and on the confirmation it did state that they were booked for a queen suite cool okay so that s not what you have if you need a pull out sof no we have our room just u the key bu yo just give u the key why do you have an attitude i don t have an attitude you re agitated but i m just trying to get you what you booked whoa back up i m not agitated at that point i just stopped addressing mr and only address the mr okay mr here are your key i m sorry about the confusion if you have any problem with the room please let me know but just be aware this room will not have a pull out sofa bed a your confirmation state then i go on to give them the information about breakfast and so forth after they leave i go to the back and continue to read my email that s when i find what happened to their room apparently we ran out of queen suite and they were placed in a standard double queen and a standard king that were adjoining damnit man if i had only kept reading all of that could have been avoided ugh i could kick myself i really beat myself up over shit like this no one else seems to make these kind of mistake and i don t consider myself combative at all but shit like this make it come across a if i am fuck me i guess i got into that nice little no problem to report lull got too comfortable and got caught slippin r roastme

sweatshirt of a private college that wa located about minute from the hotel me sir i know for a fact that you aren t driving those truck out there and i can almost guarantee that you re not the owner

the manager in charge of our schedule is generally very nice except when it come to the one thing he s in charge of he block out request a month in advance so over a month ago i requested the super bowl off because it s dead minus a metric fuck ton of togo order of wing platter that we generally don t get tipped on so i thought i d save myself the headache and request that night off anyways two other bartender the one that usually close sunday night requested off before me so i wa told my request couldn t be approved there s s e v e n bartender and we re supposed to be training a server a a fill in because none of the bartender have open availability besides me of course i wa told they d have her trained by the super bowl and i should be able to have off she s trained one night for a couple hour and i doubt i m going to get my request approved cue to tonight the schedule get posted at pm for the week literally starting tomorrow i see that i m scheduled for tomorrow night a shift outside of my set schedule which is technically out of my availability from when i had another job i wa especially irritated because my husband and i had planned a dinner with his dad which had i known i wa going to be needed tuesday night i would have rescheduled to tonight i m the only bartender that ever cover people when they need it or fill their schedule in when people request off and i constantly do them favor coming in when server no call no show but i put a request in over a month ago for it to get denied and then get hour notice for a shift i usually don t work fuck all the way off i m sick of this manager acting friendly towards all of u when he s not even going to give u the respect of posting the schedule in a timely manner

i ll start by saying that i love what i do i ve been in the hotel industry for over year now i went to college to do this and i love my job it s my hopeless co worker that make me want to leave this hotel i seem to only ever work with two people the old man that shoved me morning shift and the girl with zero confidence evening shift today wa the cherry on top with her i wa on the phone taking a very long call can t you do any better on the rate and when i finished she said i m going to clean a two bedroom suite for someone um why she said that the man wa having surgery tomorrow and didn t think he would sleep because of all the street noise he wasn t even facing the main street he wa in a room in our small hall facing the side street she also work in housekeeping and breakfast and offered to clean a room on the quiet side that already kind of ticked me off because if there isn t another room clean there isn t another room but because she s housekeeping too she know how to do it so it s not the end of the world it s not busy tonight so i ll survive for half an hour without her while she clean it it took her and a half hour to clean it i sent a message to our fom to let her know what wa going on because i m livid when i said it took her that long to clean it she replied seriously so at least she s on my side about it this girl also never wear the proper uniform we re in qa season so it wouldn t look good if they came in and she s not in uniform my fom usually make me supervisor on duty when i work with this girl and the other newer people so i m supposed to be enforcing the rule my gm said she s going to be cracking down on uniform now and she said if someone isn t in the proper uniform that they ll get sent home even though i m the sod i can t send her home i won t even go into the mess that wa yesterday with this girl and the trainee who pissed off housekeeping on a busy sunday morning when there wa no sod sorry for the rant i guess i m just tired of being expected to run the hotel properly when management isn t here but have no power to actually do anything about it
so this trio of upper middle aged rich housewife type came in one evening and proceeded to ask me to recommend an udon dish to them so i tell them that we re most known for our dipping udon for those of you who don t know what that is basically the noodle are served separately from the soup which in this case is now a thicker broth and you literally just dip a chopstick ful of noodle into the broth and consume they decide to get one order of noodle to share with an entire table full of vegetable tempura okay i bring out their noodle and take the liberty of preemptively giving them three dish of topping they typically come on the side anyways and three smaller bowl so they can split up the noodle however they want one of them look at me and asks can you split this up for u what turn out she want me to split the broth into three bowl and the noodle into three bowl for them oh and also bring them new topping dish without the pork slice i end up bringing everything to the back and start splitting up everything so i now i have six tiny bowl of noodle and broth on a tray each with like two bite of noodle and three spoonful of soup and three new topping dish i didn t know if they just didn t eat meat or if they had a specific thing about pork so i felt bad about just tossing out the pork slice and ended up asking the kitchen to make three new topping dish in case it wa like a religious thing i bring everything back out again and ask if there s anything else i can help them with one of the other lady stare at her dish look up at me and stare back at her dish i ask if she had a question what is this um they re they re noodle like the picture on the menu that you looked at that i walked through with you turn out a her friend explained what she wanted to know wa how to eat them this is a normal question one that we get often lot of people haven t had dipping udon before why she didn t just ask me that i have no idea they then leave after taking like two bite of everything so we re forced to trash most of a table of perfectly good vegetable tempura the best part wa that they tipped a grand total of like on a bill that wa in the s
i worked at a coffee shop a few year ago i had been dealing with a few health issue later confirmed to be wolf parkinson s white the best way to describe what would happen to me is my heart would flutter for a second and there would be a burp feeling traveling up from my chest to my head and then i would be ok it happened atleast once a day and other than taking my breath away for a second it never caused much of an issue i wa working the drive thru one day and i had just started to rotate the coffee pot when i felt my heart start to flutter i went to put the pot back down when my vision went black luckily i didn t pas out but i wa temporally blind holding a full pot of hot coffee with my heart racing thank god it only lasted like second or so my vision finally came back and i just stupidly continued working but i figured it wa probably time to get that looked at and made an appointment with my doctor
the night here wa quiet just a guest everyone wa quiet and tired and ready to quit the cold and snow outside usually the cold and snow brings quiet but this night it brought u todd todd is the opposite of quiet some of you are thinking that this mean that he wa loud and that is far from the case the word you seek is actually disquiet because there is something uneasy about todd it s not a quiet unease but a stream of word unbounded by logic or even a thoughtful pause the local hospital called me deep in the night asking to be able to get a room for a patient that didn t have any place to go i secured the detail that i needed and reserved him a room before i even met todd i wa teased by a sense of disquiet around the periphery of the event of the night todd look a if he ha stepped right out of a dr sue book if i am to be honest specifically and a bit to my dismay the one book that really fit seems to be the cat in the hat probably because he is a thin fellow of slight build i am certain it is the hat he is wearing that make me think so it s a red stocking cap one of those long one and i feel like it might have something hidden in it s depth it sits slightly askew on his head somehow not falling off though todd s ride to from the hospital wa unusual and it wa the first time that i have had a guest arrive in a police cruiser instead of leaving in one i checked todd into his room and the officer went with him to find the room also unusual in my experience apparently the nice officer got an urgent call before he arrived at todd s room because he hustled out of the hotel about second after without even a passing comment about five minute later todd wanders in and say that his key doesn t work he give me the wrong room number and i check his key for the correct one this is the most normal exchange i make with him i don t even ask if he need help finding it it s late and i just chalk it up to tiredness or illness escorting him to his room i notice that he seems put off by any silence and fill it with word i get todd to his room and squared away about am the phone ring at the desk it s todd he attempt for order a coke and a glass of water to be delivered to his room i politely inform him that we don t have any room service at this location and that there is a complementary breakfast at am where he can get juice coffee or milk he thanks me and hang up the right of my night pass without event other than one guest telling me that there is someone digging can out of the trash very close to todd s room i reassure the guest that we have a maintenance fellow that doe that which is correct although i am almost certain that it wa todd maintenance isn t around that early i do walk over to the breakfast area and make sure that our server know about todd i don t want her to toss him out when he come down for breakfast i also inform my fdm that todd s stay is limited to one day compliment of the hospital i figure that would be all i see of todd a i drive off into the brisk morning i wa incorrect todd came in the very next morning a he walked in the automatic door i knew without a doubt that he wasn t actually a guest last night i d have known regardless i checked to make sure he wa out at the start of the shift todd come to the desk and asks if he can warm up for a few minute i agree this morning is really cold and i have already allowed one truck driver who wasn t a guest get coffee and use the guest internet todd sits down on a chair opposite the desk inwardly i groan i know that he s going to want to interact i can sense it like the windstorm that come later that day he start talking but it s not the usually back and forth of casual conversation it go something like this i saw your son today or your brother he s getting big now but your mom won t let me touch her i remember your name art but nobody told me i don t like helicopter they are dangerous and i woke up this morning and i wa covered in honey i am allergic to bee and silver pause for breath really helicopter are dangerous i say i had a heart attack yesterday and then the hospital sent me here do you remember breakfast wa really good thanks you look like dad but a lot older than he is you look about a hundred you have a lot of kid yesterday my girlfriend is really mean and someone took my credit card you know the green one but i won a lot of money playing poker but they didn t give it to me dollar but i don t play card do you play card pause for breath i don t play card or gamble i say i have a job today at safeway but it s not starting yet i wa across the street but they said i can t be there and to come here i have a list of thing to do today but i have to pick up plastic at work for a while first what time is it do you want to see the stuff i wrote down to do he hand be a long paper i look at it expecting something scribbled but it s actually a citation for criminal trespass at the place across the street i look at it and think maybe this is good for him at least he get fed and housed he s not going to show up when his court date is of that i am certain i hand it back and say you should keep that it s important he just keep on talking occasionally pausing to breath or allow me to interject a comment here or there most of his statement though unrelated are strung together into sentence a few guest check out and after about ten minute i tell him that he need to get going i say i bet it s about time for you to get to work now and you need to get going i can t have todd sitting here in the lobby for long especially when the fdm get here and it s looking like it s going to be busy this morning he thanks me in between his stream of consciousness talking and leaf without trouble this is night shift most people are actually dreaming while i work todd is probably dreaming while he walk around of part of his life when he wasn t homeless before he had a probation officer contact at the church and the random odd job i feel like he s trapped in dream his personal history and reality and can t distinguish what belongs with what i wonder what is story really is is he a veteran damaged by war ha he always been like this fragmented or did something happen to him well i guess thing happen to all of u sooner or later hopefully they don t leave u in piece like todd edit he s back this morning sigh amp x b tldr night shift shit happens at night
i had the pleasure of being a night auditor at a hotel over the last summer one glorious night i came in at to relieve the man on evening shift who told me the tale of the havoc the woman in room had wreaked on our hotel in the mere hour she d been there i stupidly assumed i wouldn t have to worry about it too much since it wa pm and she should have been going to sleep but ala i wa wrong this woman wa using a friend and family discount for her entire family herself her girlfriend her child and uncle to stay in a one bedroom suite for for one night the normal price wa more than double when she got to the room she discovered the ice maker in the fridge wa broken and my hotel doe not have ice machine since they are in the room so since it s broken we give her a large bag of ice from the kitchen for the night she is content with this so she order a pizza to her room and without notifying anyone at the desk go to the terrace with the entire family just so she can smoke a cigarette the pizza man go up she come in on the phone several minute later telling him that she s in the lobby by the desk the man come down and is understandably rude seeing a how she wasted his time and probably fucked his delivery time so she complains to me that she didn t know he d be there so soon and how can he be so rude i didn t think much of it but i sympathized and she left after the family eats she call for someone to grab her trash i assume she s put it in a bag outside the door like i told her and i sent security to get it we don t have houseman housekeeper overnight and apparently all hell break loose when security go up the woman call to tell me that security didn t take her trash and got an attitude with her then she come to the desk and asks me for minute why we don t have housekeeper overnight i explain that we re a long term stay hotel and that people don t typically need housekeeping overnight she then explains that it s not her house so why should she have to clean up her own mess she complains that there s pizza box everywhere and that she s not putting anything in a bag for u because that our job basically this bitch want personal servant to come clean her room at her beck and call she leaf and soon after call me again this time to tell me that she think someone stole her ice yes you read that right she claimed someone must have come into her room when no one wa in there and stolen a bag of ice i figure she s outta her fuckin mind but to get her away from me i tell her i ll have maintenance read the door in the morning and see if an unauthorized entrance did in fact happen at this point the security guard is at the desk and using the security phone to type up the information they routinely do now the bitch is getting mad and getting in the guard s face bc she s using the phone when it not the guard s job to listen to this woman s shit i do my best to calm her down and she go back up she call again to the desk and start talking about the ice again now she s referring to the man who gave it to her a the gay dude and after several time i ask her to stop bc it s offensive and i try to explain if she say that to the manager tomorrow she wa planning to talk to him that she ll be removed she start screaming into the phone that she ll do whatever she want and she s gay herself so it doesn t matter then hang up she come down again soon after with a gallon bottle of bacardi and her receipt now claiming that someone came in and stole of the bottle she try to tell me she just bought it today and say i can check the camera and the receipt and yada yada yada she s clearly drunk and obviously drank the damn thing herself or poured it out into another cup just for this next part then come the magic word so what are you gonna do for me and the switch clicked in my head now i m not gonna give you even a damn dollar off your rate i wanted to charge her full price at this point but i offered to call the police for her i said ma am i understand you re upset what i can do for you right now is call the police and you may file a report if you believe you ve been stolen from and since that s not what she really cared about she walk away yelling she don t care she don t care about u and yada yada yada i checked the policy to be sure management would back me up and since she wa on a friend and family discount i had every right to do the following do to her conduct i called the room and said ma am due to the conduct you ve displayed tonight whilst staying here on a friend and family discount i am going to ask you to leave you have minute to gather your thing and your family or i ll call the police to escort you out and i hung up before she could talk she came down screaming about how could i do this where will they go saying her son is sick and i m such a bitch and they deserve a free room for all they ve endured i went to the back office locked the door called and got to watch her get removed oh and the next day she called the hotel claiming we stole even more stuff from her like a phone charger and shit like that basically anything that wa big enough in her mind for u to refund her money for the night but not so big that she d have to go through the ordeal with police my manager backed me up and told her there s nothing we can do other than file a report she came back a few month ago and took a swing at another employee so now the trashy bitch is banned thank god quick rant if you can t afford to stay in a hotel don t fucking go to one i m not a bitch just because you re too cheap and ghetto to pay like everyone else tldr woman is staying in hotel at half price decides the price still isn t low enough so she lie and claim we stole from her to get a free room then claim i m heartless for removing them due to her conduct all because her son is sick
warning long post back story i work in a restaurant where the staff can get quiet huffy short mean when there a rush and people are frustrated the boh can get annoyed with mistake i m prone to making mistake i ve been working on getting better at triple checking my order before sending asking boh about food sub request etc this is my second time being a server i did month this past summer at a country club however there usually a few bump in the night that are entirely my fault and if it ha to do with food thats been served i always let my patron know it wa me and not the kitchen that forgot an instruction no point blaming anyone else when it s not their fault but mine i ve gotten along quite well with most of the staff here i try to be helpful bus table run drink clean and reset etc sometimes i get too focused on my own stuff and helping others fall by the way side i d still consider my relation with my coworkers a friendly i try my hardest to never be mean snippy when i m frustrated a cook in the back who also doe shift a a waitress here used to have a great relationship with me up until a month ago she used to say hi when i came in and gave me a goofy nickname now she doesnt acknowledge me and anytime i speak or am in the kitchen she act a if she is entirely exasperated with me and want nothing to do with me took me a few week to stop thinking i wa crazy imagining her behavior or worse excusing her nastiness by thinking shes frustrated bc it busy nah shes just been a downright bitch to me example last night an order came up and i walked back to check that there wasnt anything ready to run for foh there wa an app waiting for the bar i dont like to touch bar food because the ticket dont tell you who s order it is ex bar and the bartending quarter are tight with saloon door to enter it s a perfect storm for me to bump into drop thing and fuck up the bartender flow i saw the app waiting read the ticket and said oh this is for bar then set the ticket down my kitchen coworker then shot off in a nasty attitude about how i should take it out for bar because maybe bartender s name need help and maybe not everything is about you when i wa done for the night i finally worked up the courage to say something to her before i left however because i can not do confrontation i immediately got choked up teary eyed red faced paniced anxiety riddled and unable to really speak i tried explaining how shes been really rude to me for week how ive always thought she wa a great person and dont understand why shes being so nasty also that her word hurt my feeling and that i would never treat her in such a manner she tried defending herself and i asked her not to talk and just let me say what i needed to because i wa basically hysterical at this point and unable to get my word out she interjected with comment like of course keep talking like you always do it all about you you make u look dumb back here eventually i went to leave and said well that wa productive and she sarcastically agreed a i left i want to note that my reaction to confrontation is what it is but hers is to have a smile the entire time which wa even more unnerving so what do i do now if anything how do i act towards her i cannot speak to her bos because he a massive prick who treat employee like complete garbage everyone boh foh hate her bos bc of his total lack of interpersonal skill sarcasm condscention and lack of empathy
so we just finished construction and opened up our new restaurant and bar on the th of last month i wa super excited because it s been a year process in waiting they even let all the employee try the food and it actually amazing we have farm to table food which honestly impressed me i worked at a shmilton harden spinn and the food wa terrible frozen junk fresh off the sysco truck the excitement wa short lived even though the food is amazing we are getting a lot of complaint that the continental breakfast is no longer a thing and now our guest will have to pay for breakfast honestly i wouldn t be writing this if ever guest wa at least somewhat sane about the whole thing but guest are going crazy they will cause a fuss at check in saying they were told we have continental breakfast and what am i supposed to do now oh and my favorite we will never stay here again my manager solution is to take off off a night from their room rate and even on top of that offer them complimentary breakfast for one night to try it out honestly it doesn t matter to me what we give the guest because obviously it doesn t effect me i just feel weird when the guest is already acting a fool obviously trying to get something from u and we are taking off their room rate like that more than cover their breakfast bill so it is like we are giving them free breakfast any way honestly i don t understand why everyone is so hung up on this breakfast thing continental breakfast suck i ve been to some nice hotel that have like a really nice breakfast platter but that is few and far between i m talking about the boiled steamed egg in a bag yes that s how they cook those egg because most place don t have a full kitchen the microwaved bacon the oatmeal with only a few topping don t get me started on the stale cereal and the weird store bought pastry i can t be the only one that hate the stuff like yes i will grab maybe a scoop of egg and the pastry probably take two bite and throw it out cause it gross when a hotel ha a restaurant and you are paying for guaranteed made to order hot food i will pay for that premium i am just tired of every night having guest go crazy over having to pay for breakfast also i guess i will add this isn t like a crazy new concept alot of hotel that have restaurant in them charge their guest for breakfast my tipping point today wa a guest literally said i work in hotel and it seems like a lot of them are leaning towards this we don t really eat to much so it shouldn t be a problem she said this and then went on a tangent of how no one told me breakfast wasn t complementary and we need to do something rant over thank y all for reading this maybe this also stikes a nerve with you or you have the joy of dealing with this on a daily basis like i do

so a i ve stated before my hotel provides parking onsite or across the street at a parking garage for the most part people are chill about having to move thier car to the parking garage after settling in because we have already assigned onsite parking but my absolute favorite response during my shift to telling someone that they will need to park across the street is the very matter of fact actually i ve already parked obviously sir i don t expect every single guest to jump out of a moving car and have someone on standby until they know where to park we have clear sign about parking i would probably get reprimanded for being rude if i pointed them out to someone every single time someone tried that response it s like all these grown as people somehow made it to adulthood without forming the concept of object permanence they can t understand that people leave sometimes i love my job but i can t with some of these people
usually i don t get guest that complain about the food or anything else most are really satisfied with the food satisfied with the quantity of their food think the service is good etc the time i do get a complaint it s usually something minor that i can fix myself without getting the head waiter or management involved but a week ago i had a guest that despite being happy with the food at first complained about the food after she finished her entire plate of roasted vegetable there were too many onion i told her i wa sorry she felt that way and i d check with the kitchen the head chef say that this a standard serving of hand picked yet mixed roasted vegetable normally he s happy to serve some extra roasted vegetable for such complaint but since she already finished her entire plate he s not going to this time she should have spoken up sooner i should add all server here are trained to ask if the food is okay after the guest have taken a few bite everything wa okay at that point in time i relayed the head chef s response to the guest and that should have been the end of it most guest that get a response like this usually accept it because they don t want to make a fuss mind you the other four lady at my table had no complaint whatsoever and were satisfied but the guest wa not happy with the head chef s answer this is the point where i ask the head waiter to deal with this problem since i have other table to look after after the head waiter wa done talking to the guest i asked the head waiter if she wa able to fix the complaint but she said she had our manager come down to resolve the problem because the discussion took a sour turn our manager spent well over minute discussing thing with the guest in the end the guest did not receive any compensation of any kind all we got wa a lot of time wasted for everyone involved please if any higher up be it the head chef head waiter or manager owner in a restaurant doesn t feel the need the address your complaint any further don t keep asking about it in hope of getting it resolved by anyone who might still want to listen you ll only waste time for everyone involved
so this happened a few month ago when we were busy and having team in so we were full house it wa pretty hectic time but for the most part not a bad weekend i wa the always smiling always positive friendly neighborhood night auditor of a room star chain hotel i had about check in passed on to me from the afternoon shift a they were leaving a whole hoard of people came in and started talking in the lobby although they were speaking another language i understood they were saying their good bye one of them came to the desk and said they were checking in i asked for the name and pulled up two room under the employee rate a a side note i know a lot of people hear horror story from people on the friend and family rate who pay half of what typical walk in rate is well employee typically pay a rate that actually cost the hotel money to house them it is one of the perk of being an employee of a chain hotel usually we will do all the stop for employee because we know it can be a thankless task and we know what they go through they are also given a generic room of whatever is available so they cannot book two queen room but they can ask for it in trace which are reservation note but also to give such a discount i require the id to ensure that it is in fact the employee checking in additionally i have to copy it so that the gm can follow up and ensure the employee is still employed our ownership is strict about their rule not all hotel in the chain do this just the one under my ownership regardless i ask that guest to get the guy whose name it is a i require him to check in for employee rate his friend grab the his friend who wa the employee and he come to the desk with an attitude like how dare i not check them in while he talk with his family i ask him for his id and credit card he pull out his credit card and hand it over i ask for his id again he reluctantly show it to me through his wallet i ask him to pull it out a i have to scan it to ensure they are employee of the brand he reply i know because i work at a hotel well if you know then why would you not pull the card out in the first place is beyond me so i mark x s by all the spot he need to initial and sign while i tell him i am going to scan copy his card for verification he rip the pen out of my hand obviously upset over me asking for id and say to me i know how to check in i cannot believe what he said and i went and copied his id and left it for the gm and gave him back his card i look at the two registration card and he initialed only one card in one spot i told him sir you have to fill out both i require you to initial and sign off for both room so he signed the bottom of the other copy and chucked the pen at me and slide the registration card over i took the pen went over the x s that i placed again and said i require this whole thing to be filled out properly or you will not get your room i gave him the pen and he glared at me trying to break the ice and make the mood a little lighter i also replied you work in hotel you should know how to check in now although i said it with a smile i understand that how after i said it how it can come across a sarcastic and slightly regretted it after i got a glare although i intended it to be light hearted and jovial i went over the amenity attempted to be overly nice to them after taking my light hearted joke the wrong way i offered complimentary item before they went up to the room razor toothpaste etc so they would not have to come back down for anything they went over to their family and finished their goodbye and most of them left out the front door i did not pay attention but a family of four two adult and two young kid and a family of one senior two adult and two young kid went to the elevator a they were going up i wa doing another check in now here is the issue a i said earlier you book employee rate you get whatever room is available we were full house for the first night of their stay and booked the second night all we had available were king suite which went to the shiny tear member complimentary upgrade so he got two king standard room part of the reason wa he only booked the day before and after the upgrade were given we also could have fixed it if he actually put on his reservation the proper amount of people staying in the room but he did not he said only one adult for each room so an upgrade to a suite which also ha a pull out sofa bed would not be necessary i finish that reservation and another reservation wa right behind them of left for me and the two guy come down and line up behind this guest i finish with my guest and i ask how may i help you expecting to ask about a vending machine or wifi password or something the employee s friend who came to the desk first time to try and check in said we have a problem i apologized and asked what wa the problem the employee guest with the attitude said do you not know how to read a reservation we need room with two or more bed each then he chucked the key at me i pull up the reservation and i am getting tired of his attitude i said first of all i did not set aside your room second of all when booking employee rate all room type are based on what is left available and king standard room are all that is available additionally you booked the reservation only the day prior when that is all we had left we could have moved around who we upgraded but you put only adult for each room of the reservation which mean we would not accommodate an upgrade over our higher tier member additionally you could have made note in the reservation requesting more than one bed you did not even do that with your reservation so yes you get exactly what you booked mean the front desk know how to read a reservation the friend look a little apologetic and say well can we get an upgrade i apologized and said we are sold out tonight and pointed to the no vacancy sign on my front desk i looked at the next day and said we had some availability to move them tomorrow a for tonight i do need to put the proper number of guest in the room that is when i found out it wa people and people so on the one reservation when you have more than adult it charge an extra per adult and that got applied to the one room when i updated the number of people in the room to the proper amount i then offered a complimentary cot for the guest i told them i would be a moment a i wa the only one at the desk when i could i got a cot and comforter and pillow for both room then i put all the note in the log book and passed on to morning shift that they may be looking for a room move in the morning you would think this is the end of my story but guess what it is not the next morning friday it wa the fds at the desk and the employee guest came down at am to have breakfast before it closed at he then said to the fds that he want his room move now she explained that a room move would happen later because there are no room ready a hskg just got in and there are no room available at the moment they went to their room packed up all there stuff and grabbed what they needed for the day and when they were leaving the employee guest threw his room key at the fds and said he will pick up the key to his new room later and that they can move his stuff to the new room well my gm just came in and saw this go down she asked what that wa about and read my note in the log book she typed out a note for the front desk to give to him when he came back the note basically said that he wa here on employee rate and he should know how to treat fellow staff at other hotel because of his attitude and the fact that employee rate is given a room based on availability and how he booked last minute we accommodated him where we could and we completed our end of the agreement so they will be left with that room and will not be getting a room move additionally the gm told the guest that she will be in touch with his gm at the other property the gm also charged for the cot that gave them at half price the employee guest came back with his family around pm and he flipped shit when he wa told he wa being left in the same room normally the gm would have gladly given him a two queen room but seeing the attitude that he gave in the morning and reading my note she wa putting her foot down they were told they were more than welcome to stay somewhere else and we will gladly cancel their second night no charge they went to their room and i heard the employee guest complain at me that night for being so rude at check in he complained at me for about minute then walked away check out day saturday he checked out with attitude got upset over the extra charge the fds that wa on adjusted off the cot that the gm posted but kept the updated rate one room wa more due to the extra adult he freaked at the desk then his wife stated they have never expected to be treated so poorly at a hotel not realizing that he brought it on himself when he got back he complained to his gm and he left a voice message for gm to get back the aftermath the message wa basically bashing me and i do admit i should not have joked about him knowing how to check in but i wa not at fault for anything else my gm contacted the other gm on the monday when she got in explained all the note left in the log book and my gm said to his gm that if they do not do something regarding his attitude she will ensure that the parent company revoke his employee rate for at least a year the gm of the employee guest did have him written up and i know that happened because one thing the employee guest did not realize is that the hotel he work at is also owned by the same ownership a our hotel so the owner followed up to ensure his antic were put on his file tl dr an employee from another hotel get in trouble because he is given exactly what he booked and cause issue not realizing the hotel his is causing problem with is share the same ownership a the one he worked at

our bellman no call no showed for his last shift which is wildly out of character all of u are worried about him and have been calling his emergency contact amp x b one finally called back today saying the last time he d seen our bellman wa when he left for work on monday morning he never showed up for that shift i don t know what happened to him we re going to try calling around to different hospital to see if he s been admitted but other than that we re not sure what the next step should be i m sorry if this is the wrong place to post but i need idea our bellman is the sweetest elderly man i ve ever met and i just want to know he s okay i ve never known anyone first hand that s become a missing person before any idea update we visited the shelter and found out our bellman ha been something of a spokesman for that shelter being one of their biggest success story his face is all over their newsletter but the bad news is nobody ha seen him still and his personal belonging are still there minus his phone which when called go straight to voicemail our next step is to head to the police station and see if we can get them to track the last tower his phone pinged off of the shelter think he might have relapsed or been attacked a the shelter is not in that great of a neighborhood local police station don t have him hospital don t have him or a john doe one of our sale team member had the morbid idea of calling local mortuary to see if anyone ha been dropped off or found but i think we re all too afraid to do that
long time lurker and i finally had something odd happen today at work i m a barista and i had a group order just takeaway coffee during a rush today after they placed their order one of the woman got me and my coworker s attention to rudely tell u we needed to actually water these plant we water all of the cafe s plant every single day she then proceeded to grab a half full table water off a dirty table then grabbed two of our hanging pot plant from inside and took them all the way out the front of the cafe to water them i thought she wa done but then she came back in and asked if she could refill the water bottle in our sink behind the counter before waiting for my response she helped herself at this point i couldn t really say much because i wa very busy and she had walked away quickly to water the rest of our dehydrated plant throughout the cafe i finished making their coffee and i didn t see her again before her group left but my coworker and i were seething at her entitlement and rudeness so that wa most definitely one of the weirdest thing i ve seen a customer do and just wanted to share it with you all i d love to hear any of your story about weird thing you ve seen customer do
i need a second to vent about this our restaurant started allowing student to use their college id meal point dealios this mean we have to manually enter all of the id information into a separate terminal no we can t even swipe the damn thing and enter in all of the amount then reenter everything on our own system to close out the check it s like having to manually input a credit card that won t swipe twice now this is fine when we are slow no worry whatever but when we are slammed forget it i have to manually enter in all this bullshit when i m weeded fml sorry table it may be a sec even worse when there are multiple card to manually input the real kicker though is that they are not allowed to use the card for alcohol purchase we have to separate the alcohol off for them to pay separately with their own hard earned money of course this cause all sort of issue when they find out they shockingly cannot use their campus dining point to buy alcohol and what doe that mean for u server that s right they have no other way to pay so their friend have to cover it and for this inconvenience we get slapped with a good ole tip so great it s frustrating because when issued these card it very clearly state you cannot purchase alcohol or tobacco with them anyone else deal with this shit i m over it
a past guest came in at pm on a sunday and his first word were i want to talk to the owner i informed him that no one else on site but me so i could try and help he huffed and puffed and showed me his cc statement with the preauth we did on his cc from last month i checked his folio and informed him that the hold wa released the day he checked out since he paid cash and that it usually take some time for it to appear on his statement but he should contact his bank cc company anyway nope he got irate and said that we caused him problem because his wife saw the transaction on their joint cc and that he thought we wouldn t charge it because he ticked the option to pay at the hotel i didn t know what to tell him besides that the hold ha already been released so there s quite literally nothing to do here and we reserve the right to put a hold on every reservation s cc a stated in the fine print and that preauth is a very standard procedure pretty much everywhere he argued some more and in a bolder move demanded that the reservation be deleted but there wa nothing else to be said finally he left but not without telling me to make sure that the owner call him back and also to make a note in the system that we are not to give out any info lest his wife call like we re not allowed to do that anyway but dude talk about shameless anyway it s your fault for cheating lmao on a joint cc no le my owner can t help you and neither can the bank enjoy your divorce i guess some people
so we have a room full of dudebros staying with u they ve been here a few night so far they re just dripping with frat boy douchebag realness but they re pleasant enough to deal with and have not really been a problem the first night wa largely uneventful i had to yell at one of them kicking the wall of the elevator but whatever last night one of them passed out drunk off his as in the lobby his friend took care of him and all wa well then while i wa outside smoking a couple of them came out to smoke too so we were making small talk then they asked if i remembered the girl they came back with the other night i wa like yeah i remember that then they started telling me how she serviced both of them i mean ok what am i supposed to say to that so i wa just like oh fun cut to tonight it s not pretty outside it s been raining most of the day and the fella are taking the night off from partying and they re bored the pool close at the start of my shift but it s still totally accessible with your room key anyway one of them come up asks about the pool hour i give him the hour and tell him it open back up at he s sad that they haven t been able to use it and asks if i could make an exception for them it s in my power to do it but i generally don t i make up some b excuse about room being too close and guest complain about the noise he go away and all is well about an hour later one of the other bros come down and asks again again very sad that they re leaving in the morning and haven t been able to enjoy the pool and all that they ve been an interesting group and not nearly the headache i wa expecting them to be so i relented i made sure they understood no noise no booze no party he happily agreed and excitedly went to get his friend and gear everything wa going ok i kept an eye on the camera to make sure thing weren t getting out of hand thing are fine until the rest of the bros go back upstairs and now it s just one of the dude and his female companion for the evening they start making out pretty hard he s laying on the lounge and she s straddled him but they re still just making out they re both wearing swimming gear and i can see that thing that should be are covered are but thing are going downhill quickly then it happens he get up fully reclines the lounge lay her down and he start eating her out now i have no choice but to intervene i quite loudly enter the pool area the automatic lock really is quite loud when it release of course they are too busy to notice so i had to be all alright dude the party is over he s stand up say ok and i retreat back to the desk i keep my eye on the camera to make sure they don t just get right back to it then the dude finally notice the camera point it out to the girl and he just kinda wave at me and they head back to the room after a while the bro i originally agreed to the pool use with come down with the lady to walk them out and thanks me for letting them use the pool

just out of curiosity currently working at a restaurant that give away a glass of bubble on anniversary and free dessert for birthday also our wine margin are insane so we usually pour ish oz pours
im a hostess at a breakfast brunch and lunch and i ve been working for a little over a year i am proud of my work ethic and i can confidently say that i am good at my job however i think i work too hard that i run myself down every shift and i don t know how to fix it we usually have severs on the weekend and busser on sunday if there is no busser then the dirty table will go untouched for at least min we re a small med sized restaurant with only table so it shouldn t be that hard to clean i really like the server that work here but some of them are extremly rude and entitled i ll be cleaning a table from their section and they ll walk up to be and grab the check tip and leave i feel like they look down on me because i m one of the few highschoolers working there it get so out of hand that i have to start cleaning them just to seat the customer because there are no open table available while taking care of the customer walking in i m cleaning the table for the whole restaurant taking grubhub ubereats and takeout order running barista made drink the host stand is in the bar and bagging up to go order i also work a a busser in the summertime because we get a lot of vacationer where i live i get so discouraged when i get my tip out i did not work nonstop cleaning all the table with no help for i think the server aren t being honest about their tip but i don t know if i should talk to management about this or if i m being a drama queen this is my first job and none of my family ha worked in the restaurant business i really need some advice am i making a big deal out of nothing or should i say something
alright then time to type this up and then get some much needed sleep so today wa pretty interesting at my workplace but before we delve into that let s give you a bit of context a of typing this within the last hour i have gotten hour of sleep not even two consecutive hour just two random hour split apart throughout the day anyway i went to work at feeling pretty drained my contact were being rejected by my eyeball and it s cold a ball where i live already a nice start so i clock in get ready look over my section and see someone already there an elderly lady who wa there since before i arrived so i thought someone already got to her about three minute later i see she still ha a menu no drink and the call server light on the ted our little techy doohickies on the table wa flashing i walk over ask if she s been helped already and in a pretty bitter tone which i totally understand why she say no then instantly begin rattling off her order before i even bring out my pen and pad barely scribbling it down and taking care of thing once she got her food it went smoothly so we re moving on a i m taking the lady s order i see a pair get sat behind her no biggie once i m at the po typing in the food i see that i got double sat which is always peachy and given that my brain is running on efficiency doesn t make it better anyway i keep the best face i can even using my tiredness to my advantage in the form of comedy which i am so glad worked otherwise tip would not have turned out great so now that i ve covered my first twenty minute of work let s get to the rest so sometime around somebody call ahead to inform u that a top is coming in they don t know when but they are coming that wa it we don t do reservation but we appreciate people calling ahead in order to accommodate that is when they give specific time so a soon a they hung up our atrium which house most of our top ha been closed to the public a a just in case measure because we have no clue when these people are going to show up wanna know the best part about this the only other big top are located exclusively in my section i m pretty sure some of you know where this is going once the atrium wa closed there wa really no need to be on a server chart so we cut down to server for the rest of the night it wa still only o clock mind you so that s pretty darn early for the next hour and a half my section wa like a hydra i cashed out one table two more took it place well not exactly like that but it may a well have been and oh god the sheer amount of top i had to serve just because our atrium wa off limit i moved non stop for the majority of my shift barely having time to even breathe because i just got triple sat with a two top and two other five top i couldn t bus any of my table because i just had zero time to do so i m just glad the host decided to say screw the rule and helped out apparently host can t bus table anymore due to recent change in the payroll but some just say screw it because they re nice people or they re bored around the top finally roll around their presence actually slowed down customer influx quite a bit but not enough to get me to actually chill for a while i wa still in a constant state of motion which again given the fact i had barely slept is a miracle on it own now that top wa about a loud a you probably imagined them being their yell and laugh echoing throughout the restaurant but something else accompanied them their collective smell wa basically a cloud of weed that i swear i wa getting second hand high from i m glad that i didn t get them since my buddy who did racked up a bill and i don t think he actually got tipped by them i feel really sorry for the guy since they were his only table for the hour and a half nearly two hour they were there naturally the atrium wa still blocked off so more people kept coming in and they kept seating me almost ignoring the other section who only had about two table in it while i wa dealing with five little sidetrack one of the table i had did the basic fry are cold can we get some new one what surprised me the most about this is that the heat lamp in the back for some unknown reason were cranked to the surface of the sun making each plate unable to be grabbed without a hot pad and everyone wa scavenging for one so another few thing to add to the night i wish i could say the night went smoothly after the top left but no just no let s begin with what i shall refer to a table since that s the number assigned to it table housed a mildly elderly couple the husband looking either unimpressed or angry so basic grumpy old man while the wife seemed confused and scared for some odd reason i did my usual routine asking how they are they asked me back after responding i joked that i wa pretty tired but pushing through but they just ignored me and went straight to asking for drink rude but alright now i asked if they needed some more time they said no so i whipped out the pad and pen only to wait around another two minute while they independently asked question and looked over the menu some more which wa great they ordered quesadilla a an appetizer then proceeded to order a combo meal that come with two entree a well a either an appetizer or two salad they went with the salad which i guess i could live with salad make the first out button on our system go screwy so we can t use it with them lady asks for a caesar salad with the dressing on the side that s it remember that now husband go for the house salad with ranch pretty basic they order their entree husband want mushroom on the side of his easy to do she doesn t want the garlic butter on the chicken and want to replace the mashed potato with rice because of some diet i guess wa the reason she told me she wa super quiet so i couldn t quite hear but i know it wa about a diet anyway i go to the system pop in the quesadilla and the salad hit send then come back put in one entree begin to modify it only to slam my head quite audibly against the computer out of frustration i hate these computer because once you move on to another meal or send the order before finishing a combo the entree turn bold and make it incredibly hard to modify either saying there s nothing there or mashing every mod onto a totally different piece of food so i said screw it finished typing it all in then had to go in the back and explain everything to the cook about time before he finally got the gist a i wa helping to run food lady from come right up and asks to have her chicken without any of the seasoning either nearly three minute after typing it in so i go back and explain she wanted it without seasoning effectively wasting a chicken breast i run out their appetizer and she look at her salad oddly then proceeds to pick out the crouton which wa never specified once that she didn t want crouton you all remember it wa only on side dressing she doesn t tell me anything just keep picking them out i walk by only second later to hear her say i can t eat this but she doesn t call me over even though i am three foot away and nearly making eye contact when i come back about five minute later with their entree all she say is that better not be our food well sorry it is it s getting cold and i m setting it down i didn t actually say that otherwise i wouldn t be coming back on saturday anyway what had happened wa that she got the attention of the manager completely under my radar and asked for a new salad without crouton but she didn t specify dressing on the side so she got it normally with the dressing all over it but no crouton just like she asked i walk by not two minute later she s eating the salad looking like she s about to cry then say to herself or her husband because her attention wa nowhere near focused on me look at this it s too saturated there s no way i can eat this she then proceeds to fork another piece of salad into her mouth i swear it looked like eating that thing wa causing her physical pain and i still don t get why she insisted on continuing to chow down on it when there wa a perfectly good entree right next to her if you don t like something just set it aside and stop eating it easy a that we won t get offended if you do but do everything she just did while my give a shit sens are offline due to no sleep hell do them even when they re online you just look sad i tried asking if everything else wa alright but i wa just met with noise after so many painful and awkward minute while still getting slammed in my section they finally paid the husband taking care of it and actually tipping to my surprise i m pretty sure that if she payed i would have gotten a big fat for a tip at least it made up for table who really seemed to like me that left on a bill i really hate it when people do that act nice only to either stiff you or insult you with low money now let s get into late night speaking of which it s really late right now i m damn near falling asleep at my computer so here s a checkpoint i ll take care of the rest in the morning or i guess i m taking care of it nearly hour later well that s beside the point anyway when late night came around the table that occupied the top were still dirty a there wa a lot to clean up so naturally i wa continuously getting hit with more and more big top pretty sure my seating multiplier reached quadruple sat range and most of them got done around the same time wanting to cash out nearly simultaneously and two of them paying in bill for which i needed to go on a scavenger hunt for change therefore wasting more time that could be used to check on table or cash the others out by this point my brain wa about a useful a a floppy disk is nowadays so thank god i never let go of my pad which had three page of backlog on it to help me remember the existing table keep in mind that each page can fit up to guest on it i m pretty sure the point in which i finally got a break wa around i had not eaten since around and we closed at when i finally got my food i still couldn t just sit down and eat it in one sitting i still had two existing table and another two showed up before the night wa over so i did my usual shoveling of nutrient gulping down soda then rushing to my table to see what they needed the guy who take down the expo line already did it and wrapped the condiment up by this time so every time somebody asked i had to waltz all the way to the cold box unwrap the sauce condiment and using one ramekin scooping it into another that wa fun once my final table left i wa the only server remaining since the other two were long gone by this time it wa around and the only closing work i ve done so far wa refill my table caddy i said screw it grabbed the vacuum from the office picked up any big trash then vacuumed my section and around the bar which is a part of my duty a well i had to help out with whatever remaining dish there were and only when that wa done did we finally lock down the restaurant and go home my one saving grace wa that my house wa le than three minute away because i wa in no condition to drive by the time this wa over yet i did so the moral of the story here is to get some damn sleep and if there s something wrong with your salad address it directly to your server who already know most of how you wanted it in the first place
so my gm piss me off for a lot of reason she occasionally doe her job well and manages nicely but this asshat of a manager can get on my god damn nerve sometimes so here are a few tale a to why example our housekeeping staff speaks mostly spanish with a few lady speaking differing level of english and u at the front speaking different level of spanish we all understand there is a language barrier at the front desk and work together to help each party understand issue with room and stuff either with the help of google translate or with patience my manager on the other hand talk to them like they are and sprinkle in spanish word the housekeeping staff hate this example hola jessica comprende me what i say to you si no or the ever lovely hola erika why you no do this i can t tell you how many time i ve tried explaining hey um gm if you are having a hard time explaining something you can use google translate it s not perfect but it help u understand each other better but she just blatantly refuse and even with the fluent english speaker talk to them like that example number my brother is training to be a night houseman yay i got him a temporary job here while he wait to get into police academy anyways my brother wa joking with our breakfast worker because he s currently training during the day with some staff to learn his job responsibility who like me because she say i m always so nice and sweet and he said lawl have you ever seen her mad a like a joke and my gm just happened to walk by and apparently this is what she had to say oh yeah i ve seen akat mad she s one of our best employee but when she get ticked off woof she s a stickler for the rule which in this business you kind of can t be and while i appreciate her sticking by the book it make a lot of people upset and my brother wa like ahh okay and the sweet breakfast lady wa kind of baffled now i m not gonna lie i can get heated i m not called spitfire for nothing by my family and while i ve definitely gotten sassy at the front before i never fly out of control like i might in personal situation because i m at fucking work what she is referring to is my way of defending my as because every time i ve bent the rule she s gotten on my as about bending them and telling me not to do it again so i told her one day after the rd time i d dealt with her pissed at me for being flexible and told her okay when you or any other manager is here for me to ask if it s okay i will do it with your verbal permission but if you aren t here for me to ask i will always go by the rule so we don t have to deal with fallout is that okay and she said yes and this woman think it s funny that me following the god damn rule of our company is bad like she got irritated at me about not checking in someone who said they were the wife of a name in the system but their name wasn t on the reservation and her address on the id card she gave me wasn t the same a the one on the reservation that last part is a rule we are allowed to bend a per manager and i told her i could give the guest number on file a call and see if i could add her name otherwise until her husband got here i couldn t check her into the room bitch went nut and wa screaming at me and my coworker i tried calling husband but he wa on military base close by apparently and wouldn t answer the phone woman is losing her mind and asks for manager who after seeing that her husband is a shiny top tier member let s her check in without proper identification she then get mad at me for not doing this another one sure i once had a man violently scream at me because he refused to give me payment for incidental and made me call my manager who said akat is it even worth it just check him in and leave a note in his reservation you need to just let thing go sometimes and then hung up on me so after she didn t defend my decision this man then continued to berate me and feel self satisfied in the fact that i wa doing my job wrong and i wa a racist as bitch because i didn t need to incidental and i wa only doing it because he wa black which then resulted in me getting accused of being racist from the review he left and my manager then interrogated after this asking if i purposely didn t let him slide in which my agm who know i m not fucking racist told my gm to stop because she wa being ridiculous this resulted in my gm making me retake my racial sensitivity training course anyways just in case or she ll make her dumb flexible rule like the one above and will get mad at you when you use them and then they backfire like when someone come in and want to check in under a duplicate bos reservation y all know the one where a bos will book a few room under their name that their employee can just check into them so yeah you are technically supposed to have the employee name added to these room but our gm let s it slide because of fucking course she doe and then the second we get in trouble because one of the boss call u and say why did you check this person into a reservation with my name on it without asking me first she throw u under the bus and say that her front desk did it without her knowledge and then lecture u about check in saftey and not checking people in who aren t on the reservation example she s super condescending like she ll ask you a question like you did something wrong and i want you to guess what it is and you re like ummm because you honest to god never fucking know with her what it is this time because it could be a small a not hole punching a paper right to fucking up a group reservation somehow so you re like can i get a hint and she s all no what did you do recently that would make me come up here and you wanna fucking die because you honestly dont know and when you tell her you don t know she get on your shit about not knowing and it make you want to throw your name tag at the wall example when you ask her a question about literally anything if could be hey do we have any extra pen to asking a question some random guest asked you like how long is your pool shell go on a tangent about did you ask anyone else before you asked me she could be the only one in the office and she will still use this excuse she also us the excuse that at pm she s technically not here anymore despite the fact she usually always stay at work until pm so when you have a question a manager could answer and you go back there at pm and are like hey gm quick question she say um it s after pm so technically i m not here and i want to scream because if i still have to work after my shift technically end at because my coworker is late i feel like you do too if your as is sitting in your back office cubicle i get so sick and tired of dealing with her bullshit and my brother who work with me now finally get why i complain about her so often he can t stand her either i just needed to vent because this woman honestly some day make me want to quit on the spot just to spite her our property owner doesn t even like this woman which is saying a lot considering he s the kind of guy who like everyone how do i know he doesn t like her well i tried leaving my job at the hotel for week a whole as story for possibly another time and the property manager wa trying to figure out why we were having such a big turn around of good employee from our property in month we lost of our best employee because they were sick of gm s shit and he said to me in a private meeting in which he asked about my departure i m going to level with you i m concerned about gm i don t think she s preforming where she should a a manager how wa gm to you a a manager and that confirmed to me that i m not crazy and this woman just isn t good at her job anyways if you read my rant thank you hopefully i won t be here too much longer because with their refusal to give me a raise after being there year and getting employed of the month time and severely cutting everyone s hour from a week to because we need to have a better budget and there isn t any end in sight and none of u were told about these cut being made until literally the day the new schedule came out despite having a front desk meeting just a week before this change in which it would have been really nice to know i m currently looking for other form of employment and by the sound of it my coworkers aren t too far behind me
it s fun to have a new story to share i haven t worked at the desk in a while since i moved onto more senior hotel management but since i don t celebrate christmas i volunteered to cover the christmas eve amp christmas shift so our gsa that do celebrate are able to be with their family hanukkah night amp just isn t that big of a deal to my family plus when i need an extra day favor in the future everyone s more likely to help me out i m not that altruistic so i m working the front desk on christmas eve slow night maybe check in easy night i ll browse reddit go down a tv trope or wikipedia hole honestly the hardest part wa remembering how difficult it is to stand for hour at a time without actually walking but this guy come downstairs angry a all heck and immediately say without context i ll never stay here again i put on my nice to guest but really annoyed face and ask what happened he go on for minute about some construction noise he heard at am we are doing some small renovation but he wa floor removed from it and said his shower water temperature kept changing ok valid complaint now understand my way of dealing with guest is to be direct ask what they want that way you don t overshoot by giving up too much and most folk appreciate being asked it s also a good way to deescalate a situation if a guest is angry but you offer an open ended question they take a moment to think to themselves what wa this inconvenience worth so instead of a full night maybe breakfast point a few drink at the bar whatever but not this guy he immediately say i want a refund for last night well while i m authorized to do so i didn t like this guy s attitude so i look in my computer at his reservation to look at his value to the hotel since i m not always at the desk i don t know people s name a well a i d like to i see he s part of our frequent guest program not top tier but not lower tier either just a i wa figuring out what to offer him he say i can t believe you asked me that you should ve offered me a free night so something about me i have zero tolerance for people being rude to our front desk staff i tell them all the time if i m here and someone yell or start to swear come get me right away well here wa a chance to practice what i preach i don t do service recovery to rude people i understand you can have a bad stay and maybe you deserve it but rule of being human is don t be an asshole to someone who didn t personally cause your problem this guy broke my rule well this is where being a senior manager ha it s perk i look at him and say i m sorry sir i won t be offering you anything have a good evening you d think i just told him his mother wa a hamster and father smelt of elderberry his face get beat red and is stunned for a moment i honestly thought i saw smoke coming from his ear he s clearly never had anyone say no to him like this so he asks for a manager and i tell him i m the most senior manager at the hotel this evening and i won t be reaching out to the gm on christmas eve a they have young kid he recovers and call me jackass ok cool i ve been called worse by better then he walk away and a he doe he lift up his left arm and tell me to go f ck myself merry christmas to you too buddy about minute later he come down and yell at me a i m checking in a guest that he ll tell the gm of the hotel about what a horrible attitude i have a i wa checking in someone else he wa ignored and just to be sure i sent our engineer up to the room to test the shower water temperature wa stable and a it should be i wa shocked i did go ahead and fill out a report to the brand just in case he decided to complain also looped in my gm and hotel ops team he complained at checkout but no one gave him anything it s nice to get to the point where you can say no to a guest don t risk your job over it of course i knew i could get away with it but man i hate people like that make me glad i m not full time at the desk anymore

bad at title sorry also obligatory on mobile blah blah blah okay so a couple week ago i had a two top come in they were two young lady and all start off well before i have a chance to greet the table the hostess who sat them came up to me to let me know one of the girl wa celebrating her th birthday i tuck that into the back of my head thank her and continue doing my job they re a pretty nice table easy to take care of however my manager end up coming to me twice during the meal to ask me to check on them because the hostess keep standing there chatting with them instead of rolling silverware which we were desperately low on i ended up chasing her off a couple of extra time too i do the whole birthday thing and run their card and drop off the slip the bill wa split one wa something and the other wa something i go to another table to check on them and the hostess is there chatting with her friend again then i hear one of the girl say tip big fat zero and they all laugh i m flabbergasted how is someone who work in the service industry even remotely okay with her fiend stiffing a server let alone laugh when they do i wa hoping that what i heard wa a joke but nope i pick up the slip and both girl indeed wrote a big zero on the tip line writing it darker than the total i approached the hostess after her friend had left and let her know that they had stiffed me conversation a follows paraphrased a this wa a couple of week ago me hey were your friend okay with their service h yeah why me i mean they didn t leave a tip h so me well if the service wa fine then why didn t they tip h well one of the girl only had in her bank account me what then why did they come out to eat h they were hungry me okay then if they couldn t tip then they should ve gone to walmart for snack or gone to mcdonalds or something i just lost money because of them h lost money what do you mean i then had to explain that at our restaurant server tip out the host and bartender of sale bartender get of sale on alcohol host get of everything so regardless of what i am tipped i pay the host of whatever the table decides to spend if i get a tip on sale i m only taking home of that tip if i get no tip then i m paying the hostess out of my own pocket hopefully she understands now that what her friend did wa rude but i did hear that those girl come in all the time and never tip i wa just unlucky enough to get the table i also died a little inside when her response wa they were hungry like you want to be a server you ve said a much would you be okay with that behavior or that reasoning for that matter
ok i ll be the first to admit that this isn t exactly a front desk post but i have no idea where else to post it and it happened while i worked front desk this last summer the park i work in and around wa scheduled to get two separate visit from the vice president and the first lady the vice president didn t come to my village no funny story about it but the first lady wa scheduled to visit my village we weren t to make a big deal out of it but it wa made sure she she the best room with a huge gift basket every guest facing employee wa berated for the smallest imperfection in their uniform the knot in my tie wa too small according to one manager and too big according to another i hadn t changed anything about it in between she wa supposed to fly into a town south of u drive though our sister park and the stay the night in the newest and largest hotel in the national park system but a storm prevented her from reaching u so she decided to stay in our sister park my friend husband work for the park service in our village and he wa to be part of her escort on her way to u and when the storm hit he wa stuck with her party the park to the south of u is famous for moose lot and lot of moose and our intended guest decided that since she couldn t see u she would see our neighbor famous moose for the next few hour while my friend radio wa connected to the same station a the secret service he kept hearing thing along the line of i uhh found a bunch of elk damnit you know she doesn t want any elk she want a moose do you think she d be pleased with a grizzly and a cub i mean that s cool but still not a moose he spent the entire time listening to them over the radio staring at a huge bull moose

tl dr at the bottom normally we see story about the guest or the interaction between employee s and homeless folk on here but today it s a story about my management team a month ago we had a pregnant employee who worked day a week on the desk and day a week usually the weekend doing breakfast let s call her lily lily wasn t the best fda breakfast attendant or all around employee but she wa there she wa mugged about week ago and due to her being a high risk pregnancy she went straight to the hospital to insure the health of her and her baby which i am all about take care of yourself first and foremost she kept in contact with management for a couple day but then just stopped nobody ha heard from her until i talked to her yesterday the doctor placed her on bed rest and because of this and her not being here for a year she didn t qualify for fmla so she wa let go due to business need we currently have one of our ft fda who s last day is on the th due to her moving let s call her sarah sarah ha been at this property since before it opened yet i wa brought in month ago and make more than she doe we have discussed pay between ourselves so that we all got equal pay know your worth she is leaving to go back to school and work at a hospital that is going to pay her double what i make i m personally happy for her we had a night auditor who went to pt we will call fred fred isn t the most subtle of guy and due to the st shift lily and sarah coming in to minute late constantly and it threatened his wife job due to child care he went to part time weekend morning until he suddenly resigned at the beginning of the week due to personal issue now when fred wa still the ft auditor i worked nd shift covering the desk for the majority of the week i had submitted a request to go to another hotel within our management company think new chic hotel to the great gatsby a a full service hotel would be ideal for me and my goal in hospitality when fred placed his week suddenly he agreed to stay to do pt for the weekend and my gm asked me to stay on board a the ft auditor which i agreed to a i am familiar with the pm and the property a a whole this all happened late september early october now when i left nd shift there wa nobody to replace me a my other coworkers couldn t work the nd shift but sarah stepped up and took it over leaving first shift without much of a window to square thing away i inquired about when we were going to get a new hire to train and get sarah off of nd shift i wa told at the beginning of the new year a we were in a slow season ok not that big of a deal maybe some ot to pick up and get a bit extra on the check we managed for a while until lily wa let go then when sarah placed her week and fred outright quitting without a week notice that leaf me our pt night auditor and one other ft employee to cover these hour starting january th yet not one ad for a position a popped up on indeed linkedin facebook ziprecruiter hell not even on craigslist my management team doesn t care how much they overwork u our busy time start in a couple week and we have nobody to cover it so in essence we be fucked sorry for the rant i just had to get it out and no one on my team even know what reddit is tl dr a of january th we will be down to ft pt to cover the desk each week management doesn t care and won t hire anybody
wasn t sure where to ask this i figured restaurant people would know we re watching the episode of the office where michael cook his foot he say he lay strip of bacon on the george foreman grill before bed it s been about year since i worked in a restaurant but i m pretty sure that leaving uncooked meat out all night is a pretty basic no no that meat should definitely not be consumed right
hellloooo just joined this sub a a new server this isn t a story i m just looking for advice so just don t read it if you re not interested i recently started my first serving job at a higher end steakhouse somewhere between outback and ruth chris lol i love and hate serving but i m glad i m getting experience now i m a high school senior and got accepted to a big school in my state i m a bit worried about going to school a i don t think i m in the right headspace to go i m considering taking a gap year and moving to texas preferably houston since i visited family there not long ago and loved it curious a to how competitive it is there in the serving industry and if it s possible to make a living while serving in houston area any other advice from server that have moved location is welcomed encouraged thanks
i m sorry for the long rant my manager are horrible at scheduling first of all we get our schedule for the upcoming week with le than day s notice which suck because i can t make other plan it take heaven and earth to get a weekend day off no matter how much advance they re given all other request may be ignored because they forgot which then lead to a call from them saying that even though they forgot not to schedule you you are still responsible for your shift and should get someone else to cover it they tend to understaff during the daytime so i ll often have entire section alone for a few hour then have people in a table section for the evening holiday are grossly overstaffed so you do pretty much the same work but make no money i worked a double on valentine s day and went home with le than minimum wage the tipping point is break i don t know what the rule are but especially for those working double break are rarely given server will literally be on the verge of giving out because of being on their foot for hr with no rest or food break we have to beg for a min break between shift and even then it s still a hassle to get it
sooooo we just got a new little store put up in our lobby with soda sparkling water snack and some travel essential i ve had like a dozen guest walk over to the store and grab something and go to walk back to their room with out paying and then i have to do the whole sir excuse me sir you have to pay for that thing i m mostly confused cause we have a pricing list on the counter next to all of the goody and it really hard to miss also i ve never stayed at a hotel that ha a free snack section like i ve gotten a snack checking into a hotel like a milton but their pantry is not free i m just really confused cause they aren t like sketchy people obviously stealing there business dude that i guess are too dumb to read a sign i guess this isn t really that big of a gripe but like how many of y all experience this level of air headedness at your hotel i feel like it always the business travel that you think would be really smart but they lack all of the common sense
so the new restaurant i m at ha an extremely strict take your break policy which shouldn t be an issue and actually something that i should be extremely happy about here s the thing even if we are extremely busy line at the door management will still make you take a break and leave the other server to suffer so instead of doing that now they make u take a break an hour after our shift even start yesterday i started at and had to take a minute at i talked to the other server about it and they just told me that they are super cheap with labor hour surprise surprise and they will take any opportunity to not have to pay you for something the reason they make you do it so early is so they can get it over with so everyone can just work through the rest of the shift i find myself just sitting and watching the other server making money and getting overwhelmed while i could still be out there helping and making money i m used to working my server shift straight through without break because that s how it s always been at my other restaurant not saying it s a good thing i d welcome the break if they didn t do it in such a stupid way am i being whiny about it is it a red flag otherwise i really like working here
a small group of middle aged men came in together last night right away they were all telling me how beautiful i am which i thought wa really unnecessary because since when is it considered normal to bombard a random person with compliment i get complimenting someone on something specific if you genuinely like their hair or something but idk i just feel like that s weird to acknowledge a random stranger entire overall appearance am i crazy because they re middle aged men and i m a young woman it obviously just come off kinda weird and i don t know how they could be unaware of that it wa valentine s day right so they also went on and on about how i should be out being pampered they asked me if i had a boyfriend and i said no so they asked me if any guy bought me flower and i said no and they got all loud acting surprised i think shit like this just trigger me extra hard because i hate being judged for my appearance even if it s in a positive way i don t know if i m a miserable person for seeing this whole interaction a so negative i literally just can t imagine any young woman appreciating that interaction i don t feel bad about being single i m not interested in dating at all right now but they low key made me feel like a single loser for a hot minute there lmao which i m sure wa the opposite of their intention i just don t get how they missed the mark that hard so one guy pay for it all and the bill wa only because they didn t get much and he hand me and say this is your tip then hand me and asks for his change i normally might think that wa a bad joke but i didn t have much faith in him a a person at this point so i literally just handed him back the he had just handed me and he took it oh yeah and at the beginning he made a big deal about giving me a big tip since i had no guy in my life when i totally should because im so beautiful i could tell by his facial expression he had no idea what a pointless exchange that wa and thought he gave me a good tip
they had a few drink and finally got a taxi to come get them after my bos told me to tell them we need to pack it up we were closed for over an hour and they were just nursing that last beer literally all the light and tv were off why the heck are people like this

at first i found it a minor inconvenience but nowadays i really really really hate this so much on quiet morning and afternoon our guest are allowed to seat themselves instead of having to wait to getting seated so my entire section is clean and ready except for one table because the guest that were sat at it just up and left and of course that s the freaking table the next guest suddenly find the most wonderful table to sit at of course out come the phone laptop book and whatever immediately making debussing and cleaning the table a lot more annoying than it ha to be you have two spherical organ in your head that allow you to see for of the love of all that is holy use them when you re allowed to sit anywhere

i realized my first post wasn t a tale and got called out but i will share a story that is one of my favorite i had just recently started at the hotel and i wa working a morning shift at am a lady and a man walked in the lady said we are here to check in i looked at her because it wa only am i told her that check in wa o clock and we didn t have anything ready she said but i m vip i replied ok but the room still aren t ready she huffed and puffed i asked for her name when i looked in our system she wasn t even scheduled for that day i wa so excited to share this i simply said ma am you re reservation isn t even for today she didn t say two word to me and walked out the gentleman followed without saying a word either it felt so good to call out her mistake however she came in the next week and i kept having to deal with her fun time
when the highest tier reward member check into the hotel they get the option to pick out a snack and a drink or bonus point instead we also have a suite shop with other product to purchase i wa doing a shift and from i wa by myself at around pm a man walk in and i asked if he wa checking in he replied back to me in a rude way saying you think my eye opened up wide because i already know this guy is going to be a bigger problem than he already is because of how rude he responded back and his snowflake status and i better be careful and stick to the script because i feel like management is going have to get involve snowball wa looking at our smilton sounder snack and drink option and he asked if we only had spring water to give out to reward member like him i said yes and he shot back right away and said i hate spring water i apologized and said that s just what we carry he then asked for a sprite instead and i said we only complimentary give out the spring water and the coke product diet coke and regular coke he looked at me and said he wa disappointed because he is a snowflake member i apologized again and in my head i already feel like he s going to use that to bully me oh boy wa i right he said sprite and dasani are coke product and he should be getting those instead because he is a snow flake status member i looked at him and said i m sorry but i can t do that he then left the front desk to go around the corner to go to the suite shop and pulled out dasani water and said he ll be taking these instead of the spring water i apologized again and said sorry i can t do that he mention his status again and said tell your manager that i m a snowflake member and i want these instead of the spring water or do i have to i apologize again and say i m just following policy i text my manager about the situation and i guess she didn t want to deal with the headache since high tier status and so she told me to just give it to him and put it in the pas down log and write it off on the waste sheet i got so annoyed because just week ago i had a hour stand off because a guest wanted week of free parking and i wouldn t budge in and today i had to give in to a different guest because a high tier member status bullied the front desk agent without a fight from management or me following script i thanked him for being a snowflake status member and felt a part of my soul die after he left to his room i always ask my gm for advice on what to do during different run in with guest issue when he s available in person and he told me i would have told you to keep following the policy but you did the right thing asking the manager of the front desk department and getting approval from her instead of taking thing into your own hand

some people two day ago we had a guy come into our restaurant in order to buy two of our fish sandwich that we have on sale but he wanted them fresh no problem i can see why you can have a bad experience with a sandwich that make you want to ensure their freshness i tell the fryer to drop two fresh for him and finish his order however about a minute and a half later the sandwich come forward and he majorly flip over i know that it take longer than that to fix the fish and i want them fresh i tried to explain to him that we d had some fish sandwich sell right before he d come in and so they were in the fryer when he d ordered they were indeed fresh he continued to complain and finally i just looked at him and said do you want me to have them make them again starting with new fish he did a deathglare at me and took the sandwich and said i ll take them but if they aren t fresh then i ll be back he didnt return that day today i wa working again when he came back he wanted another two fish sandwich dropped fresh i guess the last two passed his picky fish standard i went to the fryer myself we had two fish that were just le than a minute from coming up but i stated to them i wasn t going to listen to him witch and moan more so just drop two right now for him my manager even offered to fix those two for him since they literally came up but he made a snide comment about taking an old fish and dropping it for a short while in the fryer for a fresh order so his happy hiney got to wait for five minute for the exact same sandwich that he would have gotten at the beginning of his tirade
i work in corporate restaurant breakfast denny s type one i ve been here around year and our restroom get clogged at max one time per month i hate this place simply no customer satisfaction we close our door till it get fixed so i don t make money i should quit asap over it happened time
when i wa still pretty new at the property that i currently work at we had a rather high profile guest staying with u they were in town performing and staying with u afterwards the guest ra for rap artist arrived around am during our brand new freshly trained na s first solo shift it wasn t bad until about other people that weren t staying with u showed up for an after party in our hotel these guy were not only drinking but smoking pot playing loud music running around the hotel etc then the smoke alarm go off and wake up the rest of the hotel that wasn t already being kept up by the party the police and fire department show up to investigate the alarm and did nothing to stop the pot smoking or anything like that it wasn t until one of our guest wa apparently threatened by ra s entourage and called the cop that the party wa shut down now i come in the following morning am still training on st shift and hear about all this our fom wa training me and had to show me how to take care of that in the system when all wa said and done we had given away around k in room revenue because of this small group of people my fom charged the group a smoking fee for each of their room and wanted to charge them for every room that we refunded that morning ala he didn t and ra keep showing up in my recommended video on youtube because i just had to find out who they were btw they have been banned from our property and most hotel in town after we told them this story
so i started my shift and it got off to a rocky start guy come in wanting a room he asks for two bed and i oblige i need to get the amount of people that are in that room naturally so i ask him how many people he doesn t respond i ask again and he doesn t respond i ask if it s just him and he just blow up why would i want two bed if i m by myself do you sleep in two bed i m already getting annoyed at this i don t respond and continue on he hand me id and i get to work he asks me if he can pay in cash i say at checkout he hand me a card and it decline i do it again and it decline of course he say it s the machine s fault i don t poke at it not really that worth it he pull up his account and go on about how we ve charged him twice this make no sense i haven t even checked him in yet and his card isn t authorized for u to charge him i explain that we don t charge until he check out if i can t get him checked in it doesn t go through he insult my reading skill and i m just hoping the last time i run it it decline god wasn t so favorable and it finally approved but he s out of my hair oh he also blamed his bad attitude on lack of sleep he said it wa because he got only three buddy i sometimes have to deal with people like you on no sleep that s not an excuse to get pissy at me
so i ve been training a a waitress for the past couple of day now today i ll have my first trial shift and i m super super nervous this is the first job i ve ever had and there s lot of thing that i m learning that i have no previous experience with at all i feel like i do thing too slow and that i m kind of forgetful but the biggest factor ha been my anxiety it s not too bad but it get me kind of flustered and scatterbrained doe anyone have any advice for relieving anxiety a a waitress or any trick that will generally make being a waitress a little bit le stressful
resident friendly bartender here is that an oxymoron no looking for advice my other post didn t really get much traction on r bartender got a new gig at a chain restaurant with many many draft beer option and a cocktail program that revolves around volume and from what i can gather sugary martini i m mostly interested in this job because we are going to be busy and i ll be making bank also the opening and closing seem super straight forward to the point where i don t even cut fruit or fill my own well with ice that being said i m having a bit of an identity crisis i ve always worked in restaurant that emphasize their craft cocktail program low volume lot of house infusion and syrup emphasis on the classic y all when they told me to shake the martini until there wa a layer of ice on top of the drink my jaw nearly dropped i feel like a sell out and like i m taking a step back in concept but it might be healthy for me to have a job like this somewhere where i can leave work at work and not bring it home with me clock in and do what they want me to and rake in the cash i also think it s weird that the manager can t hang out with staff outside of work because a lot of my close friend and mentor are my former manager they inspire and encourage creativity behind the bar they have industry tie and help me network new bar manager seems like he wa arbitrarily thrown into the position and doesn t actually care about making drink or bartending and just stress all of the rule we need to be following at all time this kind of devolved into a rant but can anyone relate or provide tip for success in this environment i can pull tap handle and find way to challenge myself i just hate the corporate environment so far
i m autistic and i have adhd neither of these thing hinder my ability to my job but they do affect the way i do my job my manager constantly asks why i have my hand my pocket and i have no idea how to explain to her that if i don t keep my hand still for a moment i m gonna end up stimming while i m trying to work which might be a hindrance
quiet night tonight everyone is in so i m just relaxing when becky call she want to know if so and so is staying with u i inform her i m sorry i m not able to give out information on who may or may not be staying with u she say she s worried because she can t get in touch with him this change nothing she say so i should just call the police then sure if you feel the situation call for it proceeds to berate me for a bit for not having more information about the local police and hang up now sitting here wondering if the cop will actually show up
one of the greatest thing for me about working behind the bar is constantly meeting people you know i work in a small pub proper local that not a lot of people know about in the middle of a busy city it s very common that i will end up chatting to people i ve gotten to know over the year people i hug when they come in and people i spend time with during my free time they always come in and always refer to me for discount if there s a new person working no worry but one of the saddest thing i find is when you get home and realise no one said good bye no one took the second of their time to say goodnight i guess i m just one of many bartender that will serve them that night
so i bartend at a very popular chain restaurant and when i say this guy is a regular i mean he literally come in everyday ha been since the restaurant opened everyone in the restaurant know him he get an employee discount idk why tbh and even sometimes get his entire meal taken off we will give him free beer and not charge him for what he drink charging a pint when he really drink a tall so he get a lot of stuff for free well last night friday we were busier then expected the bar wa packed we had table and the well where the server get their guest drink wa going crazy so he could clearly see we were busy there are bartender on during the weekend and honestly i didn t even refill his beer all night or really talk to him once because i wa weeded all night well at a moment when i wa able to get a drink he said he wa ready to order at that exact moment couple sat down at the bar so i told him give me a minute and i will get his order well i forgot i didn t get his order he didn t remind me and he didn t tell the other bartender who wa the one giving him a new beer all night so at the end of the night my manager asks him if he ate and how everything wa my manager and i have had problem in the past and he know this since he is in there everyday and he tell her no someone forgot to take me order i hear him and i instantly remember i didn t get his order now i feel like the asshole and apologize and even offer to buy him something out of my own money since i forgot and he just say no i been her too long i have to go home and eat am i the asshole here like i wa busy and forgot why wouldn t you remind me or tell the other bartender still super pissed he tried to get me in trouble but luckily my manager said she wa on my side here thanks for listening and sorry if it wa long or whatever first time poster here long time lurker

this ll be short i came in to work the other day and am immediately told to go upstairs and take picture of this room okay i m thinking it s for training purpose so i can learn the different type we have nope i walk in and there s shattered glass from the coffee table blood all over the floor missing sheet an entire pack of corona drank the toilet lid ha been ripped off the seat and there s an earring and fingernail on the floor i take picture and grab the earring and fingernail to bag and head back downstairs apparently these guest checked in during third shift and left who know when because no one saw them leave and no guest were near their room last night so there were no noise complaint or anything all very scary strange been in hotel for year now never witnessed anything like this
why do i have so many serving nightmare last night i had a dream where i can into work and a table wa taking like minute to order and when they showed me the menu it wa a completely new menu so i wa so lost i kept getting seated before i could even take my table order and drop off drink and literally everything wa going wrong it wa horrible and i don t know why i couldn t wake up when i woke up i wa sweating and literally though thank god that s over
i work at a fairly nice family owned restaurant and our menu clearly state everything that is in the dish including side why do people still ask me how big the steak is when it clearly say ounce why do people ask me why kind of pasta come with the carbonara when it clearly say fettuccine why do they ask what beer we have on draft when it clearly say what one we have
we get a call that there s supposedly a group of under age girl drinking in the hotel we do some mild investigation we figure out that it s the girl sitting in the breakfast area eating chip other assorted snack and playing game co worker talk to the girl they say there s nothing going on that the caller is just the jealous baby daddy of one of the girl that everything is great ok great but i keep the camera up in the background on my desktop and glance at it more often than i normally would i notice that they start sneaking around peaking around corner to see if anyone s there standing with the ear against the wall listening for anyone coming etc i am now suspicious now i m wasting my time watching their every move on camera now i am annoyed because it s pretty obvious that they re doing something they shouldn t be there is one corner that s hidden because of the way our breakfast area is designed when breakfast is open there s a door that is open and the camera on the other side provides a clear view of the entire area but since breakfast is closed the area next to that door underneath one of the camera is a blind spot the only thing in that corner is a counter with a garbage can in it and the door to the breakfast serving area they take turn going to the garbage can but they re eating snack and shit so that s not unusual and doesn t even faze me they finally go up to their room i go double check the area they were in and don t find anything except a lot of garbage everywhere they come down a little while later they tell my co worker they forgot something in the breakfast area the area i had just checked moment before but didn t dig through the trash they go down to the breakfast area they pull the trash can out from under the cabinet out of view of camera now in view of the camera they pull a bottle out of the trash and right in front of the camera they stick it in their shirt they then come back toward the elevator a they pas the desk they tell u they didn t find what they were looking for we tell them you realize we have camera right so why are you hiding that bottle what bottle we don t have a bottle we literally watched you on camera dig it out of the trash and hide it in your shirt i turned the monitor that i wa standing behind around so they could see the spot they had just been standing with the garbage can still sitting out they didn t even bother to put it back the bottle wa empty i didn t even notice it when i went and looked in the breakfast area we would have just chalked the whole thing up to people being weird if they hadn t gone back now i m more annoyed because now we are obligated to do something since they are under aged drinker
guest is called sbb breakfast lady is abl so i get a call for a reservation sbb then say that they stayed here before and that they were told the manager gave them a free night stay this happened before i even started working at the hotel chain a whole month before sbb gave me the last name on file the approximate date sbb only told me it wa several month ago not the actual date and the room number sbb didn t even sound unsure about the room number i ve also cross checked the name with the room number and the entirety of september and onwards no one came up in that room by that name also i don t even have the authority to just erase the rate and haven t been given clearance to just check someone in for free i ran a profile search for everyone with that same last name and none of them match up with the address we were given not even the same state but there s one last thing i searched the name and found people by that name one wa paid for by a company so it couldn t have been that one and the last one clearly state that they live in a completely different state they also only had one adult on file this person made it clear they both stayed there and had a bad experience there is also no discount code or anything which is odd and on top of that why wouldn t you take a reduced price from a place you likely don t want to stay at again instead of taking another free stay this isn t exactly spelling out legit sbb show up minute after calling and she is mad because i can t check her in i explained multiple time that i couldn t do that because i need a manager approval on top of that i don t even know how to do that aside from just not checking her in at all and giving her a room under the radar not happening at all btw sbb sits in the lobby and make some call i assume for her ride to come back nope sbb s calling corporate on me i let her stay up until the call end but a few thing happen before that a abl come in for the morning and i spill the bean on this fantastic person b i try and call one of my manager they don t respond until the situation ha been dealt with which is fine and all so i decided to step out and call my manager alright so i called my other manager and they picked up where i explained the situation and they revealed to me that they hand out certificate to prove their claim which make sense and my manager said that not only did they not give a certificate out to the name of the person i got ahold of but that if they couldn t provide one i wa able to kick them out a whole hour wa filled with me burning with rage like the heat of the lobby made it hard to breathe and i wa close to losing my temper it wa mostly that i felt powerless a she lied to corporate about the event abl decides to back me up and we both go out to confront her whereupon she admits she ha no certificate and that this complaint wa over the phone erm wat you claimed you both stayed here besides i don t even know if you could use his certificate if you even had one so i say it i just talked to my manager they confirmed that you had no such free night here ma am i have been authorized to ask you to leave she s baffled and she claim i m being rude she even say this i lost my kid year ago and this is the worst i ve been humiliated my brain is working overtime to not broil alive she s using child tragedy to try and get me to sympathize with her and not follow policy then she doe the unthinkable and try to lie to abl about what happened abl take fuck all from sbb and back me up not giving her any thought and i interrupt her to tell her that she need to leave i am leaving i m calling my ride i cut her off no you need to get your thing and walk out those door you are no longer welcome here my tone wa firm leaving no room for argument sbb brag about how bad this will look for u sending her out in the cold i stepped outside to make my call and i only had my dress pant undershirt and dress shirt she wa bundled up for sure so i m not buying it the second she s out of sight i am jumping for joy and i looked like a coked out kid on christmas i had never been so happy at my job that s the complete take of this absolute shitshow of a night thank you all for joining me on this wild ride

standing outside smoking and i walked to my car and she started to slowly follow me she wa crouching down and following me like lady what are you doing i stopped and asked her what the heck she wa doing and she told me to have a good night while walking towards me i got in my car quickly locked my door took my mace gun out started my car and she wa starting to look into my car through the window i quickly backed up and drove off i called my co worker and let them know what just happened the following morning i received a text from my co worker complaining about the woman i asked what happened she explained the night auditor left note stating to not let her extend again she wa acting very odd all night she also tried to extend through my co worker and policy is we have to see id and credit card before extending and the card must authorize for the full amount some my co worker told her she ha to come down and extend she said she also ha ten minute to do so because it wa an hour past check out she assumed we would just extend her of course the card did not run co worker told her she ha ten minute to either provide payment for another night or leave she wa purposely not leaving the room all morning i then called my gm and explained to her what the woman did how she followed me to my car and kept trying to get behind the desk the in and out foot traffic of sketchy people her becoming aggressive and rude with our co worker she said we couldn t kick her out or prevent her from extending a long a we have a card that authorizes and is valid i told her we should not extend her she is on drug she is going to do something to that room something is going to happen nope did not listen to me i then got a text from my co worker saying the lady mom sent over a credit card authorization form lovely i worked the again an hour later into my shift the lady come up and complains about my co worker making her provide id and credit card i explained to her that it is policy she did her job she then brought in a man very sketchy and odd man that wa the last time i saw her for the rest of the night at the end of my shift though a sketchy man came in with a ripped up trash bag i said hello to him and asked what room he wa going to he ignored me and ran off he locked himself in the men bathroom i waited for my co worker to get in to help me get his as out when they came we went over and banged on the men bathroom door and kicked him out he drove off in a very sketchy van parked in the back of the parking lot i am not sure if that guy wa associated with the lady or not but when he left that bathroom he did not have that ripped up trash bag it wa sketch night auditor that night received a lovely visit from the police between am and am the police handed them a warrant for the sketchy odd man the lady brought in earlier they had the room number and all along with her name because she wa associated with him night auditor said have at it and handed them the front desk key in case they had to force themselves into the room night auditor said they could hear a struggle from the room and then they brought the man down in cuff they said at am he walked back in after getting arrested we aren t completely sure what happened with that the next morning they came down to extend gm extended and talked to the woman herself the woman got very rude with my bos and got offended we required another credit card authorization from for the correct date she said her mom called to extend it the mom never did she said we the front desk staff called her mom to ask if we can extend for her hell no we didn t she said we already extended her but decided to take it back never happened lady my bos did extend her for her and informed her none of that never happened and that her staff would never do that she snatched everything away from my bos aggressively her mom did send an updated credit card authorization form and a soon a my bos got that and a soon a the lady left for the day my bos went into the room to inspect it room wa trashed drug pipe everywhere meth in the sink black burnt meth on the counter burnt foil destroyed towel old food everywhere clothes in the trash can also covered in burnt meth for some odd reason there wa a pink childrens bow and child clothes in the room there wa never a child in the room i wa at school that day and i got text asking if i ever saw a kid in the room if i ever saw anybody come visit her with a kid because that wa the most alarming thing if a kid wa ever in that room and she wa smoking meth the whole time my bos said she will be calling child protective service to have them investigate all of that she is currently still watching security footage from the start of her stay to the end to see if a kid went in there at all but all of that explained her mood swing and aggression we were supposed to tell her to get her crap and leave when she came back from wherever that day we tried to call her but she gave a fake phone number she never came back though didn t even call to see about getting her stuff just went poof i think they realized we were going to kick them out i told my bos she wa going to do something to the room or something would happen but nooooooooo nobody listens to me i am not sure why she even extended after somebody associated with the woman wa arrested police had a warrant woman wa on the warrant just why extend even if that went down they clearly wanted him for something she wa involved in some form kick their ass out right then and there but no
i recently wa promoted to bartender but this wa after month of them telling me i wa moving up and me getting pissed at them for not moving me up and very back and forth anyways i moved up finally except i m not scheduled any shift next week just server shift they told me it wa going to take a while for me to get real shift and i wa mostly just pick up and a back up bartender well i tried picking up a shift and it still hasn t been approved recently i got some news from a manager that he s moving to a different place a a gm and i would always have a spot there a a server the place he is going to is seasonal but i would be making during the season i m super conflicted because if i go there i cannot be hired back at my current place i also worked really hard to be moved up but now it seems like i just got moved up because they fucked up and couldn t keep their promise to me and they just want me to shut up also a mass amount of people are about to leave so there is a chance i could take some bar shift but there s also a chance they ll need me a a server also we re gonna get fucked and be unstaffed with the worst manager ever there s just so many factor and i m scared to make a decision opinion

this is primarily for greeting table that won t stop talking to each other but work for almost any situation you have a job to do and you have to get on with it and you probably wanna flip the table anyway you can approach and just wait for them to look at you if you want but this is for the other of the time if you re going to interrupt just do it wa taught this in nyc almost always work with normal human being don t apologize just sell them something even water get them in the motion of ordering use your loud voice and just go for it with a loud greeting side note if you smile you can say almost anything and get away with it you can always tie into the fact that they are having a great conversation if you want my favorite way to interrupt is to simply reach into the center of the table and move something like opening the menu and pointing towards a specific cocktail or putting down a coaster this cause a natural pause in the coversation and a moment to start your spchill work like a charm without seeming a forward
when i wa a server i never apologized for something that wasn t my fault even when working in upscale restaurant i found that apologizing too too much can often bring out the karen s and the power tripper and i found it really didn t affect my tip not apologizing so often if the kitchen messed up i would say the chef sends his apology and if i forgot something or made an error i would apologize but if it wasn t my fault i would just tell the guest that i understood their concern and i would share with them what wa being done to fix it if nothing could be done i would ask them if they would like me to bring the attention of management ha anybody else tried this
obligatory mobile not native etc long one incoming necessary backstory i live in amsterdam the netherlands where our official language is dutch i am dutch but not white otherwise fluent without accent i work in a japanese restaurant with mainly japanese people working there so our main shop language is english for the few co worker who don t speak japanese and the many customer who don t the racism in this story isn t directed towards me but my japanese coworkers the lovely sen in particular not her real name but she reminder me of a ghibli character so she speaks japanese only with only basic english skill to start off the night there wa this lovely family of sitting in a far corner this one wa more minor and light hearted to lift the mood before the fiasco to come i wa busy cleaning the table next to this lovely family when i hear the son about loudly complain to his mom why they re in a japanese restaurant where all the people don t even speak dutch sen had tended to them earlier and had weird accent why they couldn t just go to somewhere with actual tasty food mom didn t really seem to care and completely ignored the whining going on about how wonderful a different japanese restaurant wa in the end the son had barely touched his food when his mom and sister decided to leave but he angrily tried to stay behind to eat more because it tasted so good now onto our bigger story which probably disgusted me more than it should but my disgust wa confirmed by customer who had been there the entire time at this point it wa getting rather late so after pm and this group of come waltzing in luckily for them there wa only one other table filled so they could actually sit down they looked like a bunch of men just finished with a week of physical labour ready to get drunk we greet them with the standard welcome and they respond with muah off to a great start sen tends to their table and immediately they restart the conversation with more kiss and copying anything she say that sound remotely funny to them sen being the amazing human she is responds with a small laugh and proceeds to take their order because the amount of beer they order is more than she can take by herself i assist her but the moment we return to their table they re back to making sexually tinted comment about her the kicker they re speaking only in dutch from now on she leaf before i do cleaning up a bit after some beer spilled on an adjacent table they start loudly and i mean really loudly talking about how sen is clearly putting up an act to refuse to speak to them about how she can surely speak dutch and understand their comment this continues all the way up until they finally check out which take age considering some of them were too dumb to even remember what they ordered i go to clean their table and it wa probably the most disgusting state i ve ever seen any table be left behind in the floor got a much noodle a they probably did considering they barely ate half it took extra strong cleaner to even get any cleaning done when i return to the counter they re still busy making comment figuring out who pay for what they turn their attention to me asking me if i came from somewhere nearby i have no idea it wa slurred and for all i know he could he asking about my school i m not from the area not planning on giving him the satisfaction he wanted i just smiled at the one asking and responded in japanese that i had no clue what he said he turn his attention back to sen and suddenly they all try to bribe her to speak dutch it took me standing next her at the counter with an annoyed smile i m a lot bigger built than she is and a lot le cute japanese looking to finally get them to lay it off and pay they didn t tip of course not mandatory in the netherlands for any american who wonder when the table that had the horrendous fate of sitting next to them paid about half an hour later they were appalled for u and apologized for not stepping in apparently they heard a lot worse thing than i did but they didn t want to have to repeat it for u they actually left a tip for our trouble and were really nice and apologetic about the whole thing the worst thing sen had no clue any of it wa going on to her it could have just been any sort of drunk mess
i used to work the front desk at a local gym when i wa in high school i have many vivid memory of the encounter i ve had which gave me many story to tell in the future this one i m particular isn t necessarily funny but it wa very confusing and frustrating for me to deal with so there wa this incredibly ripped lady who always came into the gym with her husband during my shift i would greet them and the husband would say hi and smile at me and his wife would often ignore me tbh i wa always scared of her she wa ripped and had this permanent look on her face that looked like she wanted to rip anybodies head off after the end of one of her workout her husband left to go start the car and wait in it cuz he didn t come back inside and the ripped lady from this point forward will be referred to a rl came up to the front desk rl slammed her phone on the desk and slid it towards me she didn t say anything to me and i saw on her phone that there wa a video of her doing pull ups i didn t know what she wanted from me and when i looked back up at her she had her usual murder face on me cool your form is pretty good one day i ll get to that point to haha rl didn t say anything her arm wa still outstretched holding onto the phone the pushed towards me i wasn t sure what she wanted with me and me and her ended up just staring at each other for a good second a year old socially awkward me tried to figure out what to say to her me do you need any help with anything rl continued to stare at me not changing her stance at all i wa getting very confused the longer it went on and asked if she wanted me to do anything with the video like posting it on the gym s facebook page or something she continued to stare at me a if she wanted me to read her mind but i can t read mind so it wa just a lot of awkward silence finally she spoke rl i didn t film this me oh ok did your husband she stared at me longer this time she squinted her eye and dragged her phone back towards her rl no me oh uhm ok who did then rl what are you going to do about this i wa slowly starting to realize that someone might have recorded her without her permission but i wasn t for sure she could ve set the phone up somewhere or had a friend record it would ve been much easier trying to figure out what she wanted if she communicated instead of trying to talk to me telepathically me did someone take be video without your permission rl do you have facebook me no i don t sorry rl sighed annoyingly she wa slowly getting more pissed and i had no idea why she refused to actually tell me what s happening me can i help you do something with the video rl find the guy who recorded it and take it down finally i wa getting some answer me i can try to help but i can t guarantee i can get be video down you might have to contact the user who posted it and ask him to take it down if you have a physical description or name i can contact the manager so that she can use the gym s facebook to ask him to remove the video and we can fix this problem rl sighed heavily and angrily then she walked out the door i called after her asking if she wanted to give me the name and she didn t respond i told my manager and she said to not worry about it anymore since we had no way of fixing the problem after that day i never saw rl again i saw her husband but never her i never found out if she just came in when i wasn t working or went to a different gym altogether after that i just wish she had used her word because she wa not disabled in any way just quiet my manager had talked to her husband often and he said that she s just super quiet also never found if the video wa ever removed overall it wa a confusing time

i m on mobile so sorry for the formatting little background i ve been at this hotel for year now smaller hotel at room we were within the yhg brand and the remodeling cost would have built u a new hotel so our owner decided to switch u to a yoice brand hotel all fine and dandy until the day of system switch we changed in january and the day we switched wa very interesting i worked a swing shift from am to pm when i left at not everything wa completed only one front desk computer wa working and we couldn t get cc to go through our fix wa to run it off a hotspot yes we were running the front desk off of a hotspot only one computer though the other one stayed on the old network so we could print we checked people in on one and printed everything off the other we had to run it this way till our new internet circuit wa put in on a different to shift the day after the new circuit wa put in in my hour i got one thing done and that wa deciding we needed a port unmanaged switch so we get one shipped out to u and i spent a few hour on that while my agm watched the desk i got the interface server working and that wa it i come in on a midnight shift and wa able to find what port for the front desk computer the office printer and the manager computer only took a few hour everything wa working fine until today yhg turned off the access to their equipment and it killed the internet at the front desk we still are uncertain why specially since we were on a totally different network so back to working off the hotspot after ish hour we got it back up and running weirdly the computer needed to be fully unplugged and plugged back in since restarting or shutting down window doesn t clear old internet setting monday we start remodeling the lobby yhg wa no help and neither wa yoice if anyone here ha to switch brand i hope you don t have nightmare internet issue a i ve had but now we have a network map for our office
i ve been working at a very upscale hotel front desk and gym front desk for awhile now and i wish i d known about this sub earlier i have so many juicy story but for now i will begin with this one for a bit of background the gym located within the hotel is also an independently operated membership gym we have around member and i work the am to pm shift day a week i know the name of all our regular and for the most part they re perfectly kind and no trouble at all there were however two exception to this let s call them dave and rich dave and rich were two member of what the staff call the good ol boy club they ve been member of the gym for year and act like they run the place rather than exercising they usually get on a bike for about minute then wander over to our waiting area sit in the comfy chair and talk politics for hour they were a bit rude to me when i started but my customer service charm i m dead inside ha warmed them up to me dave and rich absolutely hate one another and constantly tattle to me about one taking the other s locker they both refuse to reserve one so no rich that isn t your locker or when one take the other s favorite exercise bike yes i m serious i suppose when you re a millionaire and retired you have to invent the problem in your life anyway one day the two of them were in a heated argument about the sacred corner locker they both prefer i didn t hear what wa said that pushed thing over the edge but dave snap and punch rich square in the nose i call my manager and security right away and the two are escorted out surprisingly they are put on probation rather than outright banned because of their long time member status now while wild to see two old men get into a fight about a cubby to put your skivvy in it wa about to get so much more juicy a week following this altercation the two seem chummy again and are soaking in the hot tub conversing a usual i m sitting at the desk watching the security camera when i notice some unusual movement no it can t be are they oh my god they are the two of them were taking turn pleasuring one another with their hand right out in the open i can t imagine they knew there were camera for guest safety in the pool room these two both have wife which are also member at the gym and child i wa in shock and wasn t sure what to do i d never dealt with anything like this before a i d only been working for this place a few month so i rang security and asked their advice a gentleman wa nice enough to come down and do the dirty work for me of asking them to leave they reviewed the security footage and determined the two gent are no longer welcome at the gym now of course thing get even more awkward for me from here who should come in the following week but dave s wife asking why her husband is no longer allowed to excercise with her my manager decided the best thing to do would be to stay mum and refuse to tell the wife he just kept repeating that she should ask her husband this question claiming he couldn t legally tell her b but hey i don t blame him for lying rich s wife came in a month later with the same question and we refused to tell her a well soon the wife cancelled their membership and i ve heard from some of the other good ol boy that dave is now divorced and dating a man i can t help but wonder how long rich and dave had been involved with one another wa the constant arguing a ruse to throw off suspicion either way i hope the two of them are doing alright
short story but i m working in a fairly small hotel and am the only employee in the building overnight so naturally i have to clean up what i can without waking guest after people throw huge party that s not where the story is that s just context this particular party wa large enough that i had to constantly make trip in and out of the supply closet in the employee lounge behind the desk for different cleaning material and therefore wasn t sitting behind the desk i carry an office phone on me for this reason and there s a sign on the front desk telling people to call it if they need me so while i m making a trip back for a mop bucket and some sanitary glove because of a goddam diaper i found in the corner of the pool room i m met with a man scrounging behind the desk because he lost his key and not only failed to read the instruction about phoning me but also the employee only sign giving the excuse it wa unlocked because of course it wa i ve been making constant trip for the past four hour cleaning up after what i later learned wa two separate party one that s still going on at am and now i ve got to clean up all the key card he d thrown about the place
a few week ago a very french woman called and asked for the housekeeping manager we transferred the call upstairs a couple minute later she called again again transferred the call the next day i believe the housekeeping manager came to u at the desk and said who gave my cellphone number to someone asking for a job big no no i don t know if my manager ever figured out who gave out her phone number but i thought most people knew not to give out personal information to stranger fast forward to today a very french woman asked for the hskp manager then i realized it wa her again i speak french but even i had a hard time understanding her she said that she applied online and no one called her for an interview okay maybe we re not hiring i keep telling her that she need to talk to the hskp manager and she wasn t listening she kept going on about how she worked at a nice hotel in montreal and she really want a job with u okay you have to talk to housekeeping and then she called again time today at this point i wa fed up and called the manager myself i told her that it wa this woman again and she told me to just keep deterring her say that we might not be hiring if she call again i m going to say if they re interested in your resume they will call you thank you and have a nice day lt i gt click lt i gt i don t understand people sometimes there s being proactive just checking to see if you got my resume and there s pushy
for all of my server whose dining area are on carpet doesn t it upset you having to sweep section table with muddy floor i have literally seen footprint leading to table or bigger table caked with mud from a party of i guess outdoor ish worker especially on weekday it is a pain in the as to sweep i have to take a rag to clean off all of the mud they literally play footsie with the table leg and then i spend extra minute sweeping under that table to get all of the mud and grass under it not even a wet rag or a paper towel can clean that crap up i just hope the closer is lenient enough to not make me re sweep it s annoying that these people can either just change shoe at home or if they could just wipe their foot before they enter through the door honestly it feel disrespectful that they don t even try to wipe their foot even a little bit before walking through the door it s like an obligation for u to clean up after them like child to me it s similar to karen that expect u to clean up after their child that spill their baby food all over the table floor
i put your steak in a medium rare plus believe me i double check my order i told my kitchen manager who wa running the line how you wanted your steak prepared i can t be there to probe every order of mine with a thermometer every once in a while the cook might mess it up and a food runner might run it out i come back to check on you and you say everything is great subsequently after bringing multiple refill to the table bussing appetizer plate in general just making myself available to you you tell me the ribeye wa really overcooked and tough i look at the plate and there s only scrap left i m pretty good at reading face this person wa just complaining for the sake of complaining tbh my mom is the same type of patron always ha to make a comment at the very end of the meal about how something wa below standard it irks me this lady wa definitely trying to get a comp d dessert or free ribeye i really strive to give my guest the best experience possible i truly want them to enjoy their dinner and come back to sit in my section but at that point all i could say wa i m so sorry i wish you would have told me earlier when i checked on you i could have had the chef make you a new one but you said it wa great got stiffed on that check but that s ok it wa busy enough to still make some decent money lol givethebestservicebutdontbeadoormat
this is going to be a bit long i apologize in advance there s a tl dr right after the introduction english is my first language and i m on a computer so any error are my own n my coworker j her sister i ve been dealing with a coworker n who act like i murdered her entire family and her dog for about a month and a half now friend i ve talked to have encouraged me to go to hr but i ve been hesitating yesterday my gm pulled me into his office to get my side of the story again he took statement from my coworker and her sister and he s taking it to hr himself because my coworker can t stand me i spent yesterday and today working on my statement and honestly i m stressed it s nerve wracking i love my job here and don t want to lose it any advice would be welcome to make matter worse n and her family have been living at the hotel since the end of december all of them over room our double queen room sleep so it s not so bad so i haven t had a moment s peace they moved in before she wa hired they haven t even paid since the second week of january so their bill is astronomical i don t know why or how my gm is letting them get away with it but he won t tell me a thing tl dr my coworker ha made work a living hell for me because i told her what the housekeeper told me to tell her this is the statement i typed up with name and location changed n started working at the hotel early in january and we got along well from the get go at least i thought we did she learned the system very quickly and did well with the guest her family wa frequently in the lobby so i got to know them all pretty well n even tried to set me up with her sister j because she thought we would get along very well and it s hard finding other lesbian in a new state in the actual statement i said n wanted me to befriend j i m not about to out her or myself without permission they were mostly well behaved but i had to ask n to talk to them about a couple minor thing like horsing around in the parking lot in the car because i wa worried they might accidentally bump someone or if another guest had complained about something like the one adult son using the mac computer in the business center to play game for hour i tried to do it a respectfully a possible since i liked them and they were paying guest a well in the case of the computer i told him that it wa okay for him to use the computer anytime but asked if he could limit his time to a few hour at a time if other people wanted to use it i think the computer itself ha a timer that only go to hour anyway before automatically logging out the user i would do the same thing for any guest complaint so all the guest can enjoy their stay here on january st i wa working a morning shift when the head housekeeper came to the desk in a tizzy saying that the housekeeper were throwing a fit about a pair of room having too much trash demanding sheet be changed every day and being too bad to clean every day a a light clean i quickly wrote down in the book what she said then asked what room she wa talking about i wa surprised when she said n s room i wasn t sure what to believe but we ve had problem with extended stay room with a lot of people in the past we ve had a few unfortunate situation where the family caused so much damage that the room had to be put out of service for up to a month one room wa out of order for even longer and still smell faintly of wet dog when it rain in those situation i tried to stand up for the family and ended up in more trouble because of it i asked n to come down whenever she had a chance and when she did i cautiously explained what the head housekeeper had told me and that the housekeeper wanted them to bring their trash bag down themselves our sale manager who i adore wa at the desk when this happened and she chimed in that it made no sense she had seen the room and they weren t that bad the housekeeper were just being dramatic i said oh okay nevermind then sorry and thought that wa the end of it i had never seen the room so i had no way of knowing i wa just passing on what housekeeping had told me thinking that a a coworker she would understand the misunderstanding i didn t think anything of it until j n s sister wa heading to work one evening i wished her a good night and she responded with hostility confused i said i m sorry to which she replied no you re not i had no idea what she wa talking about since a far a i knew we were friend when i got off work i rushed to the gas station for donut a a peace offering then over to our sister property where j worked night audit hoping it would just be a quick case of popping in finding out what wa wrong apologizing for being dumb then on my way home i realize now that going to her workplace wa not the best idea but in the moment i wa only thinking of her a a friend who wa upset about something when i tried to talk to her from across the lobby because she stepped away when i tried to offer her the donut she accused me of harassing her family citing the event with the car asking her nephew to share the computer and even saying that i had told her family they couldn t use our grill late at night the last one surprised me because the night in question i went out and lit the grill for them at pm i even said it wa fine for them to use the breakfast cart a long a they had it back by morning she then said i had called her family filthy i tried to insist that i had never called them filthy i didn t think that at all and that all the other time were misunderstanding she told me to get out and leave her and her family alone i left confused but i wa going to keep to my promise to leave them alone despite how much i liked them i didn t want to cause more heartache or trouble the gm called me into the office the next day to ask me my side of the story and admonish me for writing the housekeeper comment in the book he said that n wa absolutely insulted by it that i had told everyone her family wa dirty n hadn t said anything to me about it before i felt horrible i really like her family they re all nice people we re supposed to document everything to pas on to later shift and for future reference date of complaint who made complaint against whom note from housekeeper etc everything go into the book the only people who see it are n myself and brett our night auditor i had mostly written anything to keep housekeeping happy but i had never intended it a an insult i asked the gm what i should do how to make it up to her in some way he told me to leave her alone and keep my distance until she had cooled off so that s what i did for the first week i ducked away whenever she or her family walked through the lobby hid my face and only spoke to her family when they came to the desk a the month went on her family wa friendly with me so i started to relax we chatted joked and i helped them with whatever they needed even bending the rule a little bit when they wanted something from the breakfast area late at night however n and her sister continued to be openly hostile towards me even a month later n would glare at me if i so much a tried to say a word to her i attempted to apologize twice once a couple day after the talk with the gm and once a few week later when i worked up the nerve other than that really the only thing i would say to her were hello and is anything to pas on or strictly work related question needed for me to do my job properly these were met with either ignoring my existence entirely a flat no with rolled eye get out of my face or just don t talk to me most day she walk out the moment i clock in before i can say anything i ve had to ask our maintenance man about anything going on this is still going on over a month since i passed on housekeeping s message over a month of hostility from her ha left me feeling miserable i used to love coming into work i ve been at this hotel since it before it opened i helped set up the room and clean up the construction debris i see this hotel a sort of my baby and i love seeing it do well coming to work wa exciting who would i meet today whose day could i make a little brighter cheesy sure but it wa fun i just love making people happy even the worst day or most abusive guest couldn t dull how much i enjoyed doing my job even hockey team were a breeze but now i dread it i dread coming into a work place where my coworker is openly hostile towards me for a misunderstanding i ve had day when i ve felt physically ill at the thought of just having to say anything to her our staff is miniscule there are only fda one of which only work one day a week and na any drama is more deeply felt than at other job with larger staff there s no escaping it i don t want to cause her or the hotel any trouble i just want thing to go back to the way they were before when we were still friend i don t want to be treated like a pariah at the job i loved am i an asshole for being fed up with her behavior

good morning fellow front desk warrior and lurker in the back i haven t posted for a while which is great the holiday tanked our occupancy which isn t awesome for business but it s fantastic for my soul no recent homeless people hijinks though i m probably due for one and becoming a vampire ha the added benefit of not seeing management which is great it also mean i have zero idea what is happening at my property at any time turn over new trainee breakfast area remodel who know i m just the na let s talk about my gm we ll call him charming charlie cc is a ish male who sort of look like those conventionally attractive model you see in magazine dead eye nice jawline no soul etc his personality is that of someone who is used to being handed everything because he s vaguely charismatic if you re into that ken doll kind of thing and good looking we quickly found out that he is also one of those people who will delegate all of his task to everyone else so he just show up whenever he want and look busy he wont answer the phone when you call like of the time and then he will text you an hour later saying you called he will also not answer his phone if we call past pm emergency hah better call our poor poor overworked agm who is burning out so fast i m surprised they re still around but i digress why is any of this relevant well you see our full time breakfast lady is sick with bronchitis i knew her shift would probably be covered by someone else but since i never got a call or text i just assumed she wa coming in que the poor year old boy who came into my lobby at am this morning with the opening line hi the only thing i don t know how to do is cook the food at first i wa exceptionally confused but then i realized that my gm had asked some kid from another property to cover breakfast also that he doesn t know how to do breakfast now i am a night auditor i know how to do most of the breakfast set up but not all of it so after frowning for a solid sixty second i put up my away from the desk sign and try and muddle through the set up with this half asleep teenager we manage to open on time but then the kid say i m really sorry for the trouble but charming charlie said he talked to you yesterday and everything wa good to go did he did he really well that s funny because i don t remember the last god damned time i received a text from charming charlie then at am a woman i had never seen before stroll back into the breakfast area and asks the kid what she s supposed to do turn out she is a housekeeper with no breakfast training that he asked to come in and help the year old without breakfast training did i mention that we have a hockey team in house wheeeee i am clocking out at am on the nose and enjoying the first two day off in a row that i ve had since october hopefully nothing burn down
so i worked at this breakfast franchise downtown over the summer it wa pretty disorganized but i worked with a friend and it could be fun one saturday morning busiest and hottest day of the summer during the beginning of a hour double girl walked in they looked like trashy off brand cardi b with attitude one server had the section they sat in but he said he didn t wanna serve them a they probably were the bad type i said i d take them since you can t judge a book by it cover i later came to regret that decision i get them water and ask to take their order of them weren t ready and told me to come back the th one looked like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed and ordered me to take her order she wanted an appetizer of chicken wing she said she wanted chicken wing and scowled when i didn t know what that meant i asked before putting in her order and told her we don t do that since it come prepackaged and ready to cook with a mix of flat and drum before i finished talking she immediately asks to talk to my manager who told her the same thing and i take drink order when i get back with drink she demand to know where he food is i never put the order in since she talked to the manager and assumed she didn t want them anymore she said if it s not mostly flat she d send it back to the kitchen she also demanded that they come out before the entree like duh it s an appetizer she ate plate and demanded they be free because they weren t to her liking the girl ordered their food and she requested a specialty drink which take a while to make so i couldn t put in everyone s order plus i had other table she wasn t happy about the minute wait when she got her food she threw it on the floor because the broccoli wa raw we steam out vegetable but she didn t say she wanted it saut ed when i asked she asked me if i wa new because i wasn t very good at my job and said that it wouldn t be long before i wa fired i wa really over her and her friend since they just let her be rude without telling her to chill while dealing with her i lost a table since i wa to preoccupied with her b to look at the tablet and they changed table section still i smiled got them their many round of drink and tried to be a nice a i could even though i knew she wa giving a tip at that point they were there for over an hour so i wa just waiting to leave their check everytime i passed their table she looked irritated even if i wasn t greeting them and just getting other order when i wa getting dish from another table she called out and told me they wanted their check i already had it ready in my pocket but my hand were full and no one else wa ready i collected the cup from there table and told her i d be back with their check she instead decides to throw her money on top of the dirty dish i m holding and loudly say i m not getting a tip so i need to bring back a receipt i wa so fucking mad but i had to keep the smile up i had to get her cash out of a pile of spit out food in the dish room my manager said i should ve just thrown it out with the food after that i returned with the actual check and she wa mad because i handed her the wrong one a if there s not others i had to give out and asked for her change my restaurant doesn t keep a lot of change so we just round to the nearest dollar i gave her the cash and she screamed at me over the cent she wa owed i ran around looking for penny and she continued to berate me all together their bill wa around and i made dollar in tip from the other so everyone kinda sucked i wa so fucking glad when they left she d also made a mess between the spilled food and her drink that i had to clean low on bussers but i wa just relieved my bos felt bad and gave me a free meal for dealing with them i really hate people but i love the money tl dr customer treat me like shit doesn t tip and throw her cash on her dirty dish to pay
i serve table in a cafe breakfast and lunch typically with mostly older clientele a lot of older people sometimes with their grown up kid and their grandchild we re doing a friday night fish fry for lent and i have been selected by my bos thanks to serve those night i had a regular come in and older gentleman with his wife who is now in an elderly care facility she doesn t come out much but they would both come the restaurant regularly with all their kid grandkids etc especially for the fish fry they come with their eldest son we ll call him keith and say that there s going to be more joining so i get a table ready and take their drink order for just the three of them normally i would set out water for everyone waiting but it wa slow that night so i didn t have to rush rush thing a i normally would so i took thing naturally slow and casually ten minute go by and the others still haven t shown up i go tell them that if they would like to order while they wait for the others or just wait whatever i m in no big hurry they just order a couple of appetizer and say they ll order full meal when the rest arrive i bring out the appetizer and let them enjoy it shrimp cocktail with a spicy twist they love it twenty minute go by still no family i ask if they are ready to order or still want to wait they say they can wait i have no problem with that and go to serve my other table my mom come in i smile and sit her and serve her food not really part of the story but that s what happened while i wa still waiting for the family another ten minute the family still isn t here it s been minute so far so i ask again if they are hungry they are pretty fed up with the rest since they live right around the corner according to them they order their plate the plate are actually named after them keith s bbq shrimp his recipe and the potato we serve in the morning are named after the last name of the parent i bring them their food and they sit and eat for a while longer i bring out their complimentary dessert they pay and eventually leave then five minute later five minute the family show up i ve already cleaned up the table and reset everything when they come in i turn around recognizing them and tell them that keith and their parent already left the son of the parent look at me and say i know we were waiting for them to leave they were tracking them with the apps on their phone waiting for them to leave so they didn t have to spend a meal with them i wa aghast my mother thought it wa a joke i assured her the tone of his voice told me it wasn t a joke he wa dead serious please spend time with your family especially the elder you don t know how much time you have left
this happened yesterday i work a a daytime fda at a medium sized family owned property with three unit on an european island we mostly deal with german folk who are generally very understanding and patient unless you don t give them what they think they ve booked in which case they ll fall into despair sometimes cry and yell at you like you re the one who allocated their room in the first place spoiler it not any of the fda s job to allocate room a you may know it wa christmas two day ago in our region both the th and th of december are bank holiday in an effort to give their employee more time with their family the property owner and administration board decided a few year ago to dismiss most of their hsk team every bank holiday and only a select few actually stay on duty guest are notified much in advance that room cleaning only happens if they request it the day before the th come and go without a hitch some guest get their room cleaned a they ve requested the th come along and all go well during the morning shift no guest seem to have an issue with cleaning happening the next day i arrive for the evening shift along with another fda at in come pumpkin head pumpkin head probably ha pumpkin seed for a brain look like a bald twelve year old probably forgot to take his med that morning and a you already know is an entitled cunt pumpkin head arrived on the st and wa checked in by the very fda doing the evening shift with me so we are sure he got notified about it conversation went more or le a follows before we unfortunately had to give in and find another solution ph hey my room hasn t been clean in two day what s up with that me i m sorry sir today s a holiday so there isn t room cleaning for the day unless requested were you not notified about bank holiday policy ph uhh no i want my room cleaned though i don t care if it s a holiday or not me you see sir at the moment we re out of housekeeping personnel they ve already gone home ph uhuh yeah but i want my room cleaned i paid for this stay spoiler he didn t so i have the right to get room cleaning every day holiday or not me again you needed to let u know that you wanted the housekeeper s service we only had enough staff to clean the select few room that requested it in advance and i m left without any option ph it s not u the guest that have to tell you you simply do it for u and that s that and if you had enough personnel to clean a handful of room then you should have enough to clean all room i don t care at this point i wanted to punch him in the face for the typical spoiled brat attitude in the end we asked the manager on duty for the day who by chance wa one of the head housekeeper to clean his room i heard later that when she knocked at their door she decided to be petty about it and acted sickeningly sweet borderline annoying just to piss them off a lil further i love her a for pumpkin head he got his room cleaned and a free fruit basket in his room today courtesy of the management this is only further proof that the shittiest customer always win edit formatting
if you read my other post i mentioned my current gm isn t the best and i suspect she is trying to replace all the staff she hired with the old supervisor well today i got a write up for a day i didn t work for an incident i tried to fix but wasn t allowed to so what happened i missed the meeting room which should have been set up the night before i worked or at least reminded about if pm wa unable to get to it it s both the pm and night audit s job to make sure the room wa ready for guest well it so happens the night i worked i got distracted by guest checking in super late like just before roll over at am so my usual night schedule wa mixed up and i wa already late on breakfast set up along with pre checkout i am also doing na because i wa forced to and had already from the moment i wa hired during the interview mentioned that i rather not do night because i tend to struggle with the first night if thing don t go with routine plus life happens during the day and i can t balance my schedule with night anyway on the day of the incident i actually remembered to check our meeting folder and noticed that there wa a meeting scheduled for the evening half asleep a i wa i informed the current supervisor that i missed the meeting room and offered to stay an extra minute to set it up properly if it wasn t already well one of our laundry lady fly out of the back going on about how horrible it wa that i didn t get the meeting room done and how i need to be talked to and it s the end of the world etc etc well the supervisor at first began to agree with me to let me just set up the meeting room the laundry lady just go kisathemistress doesn t deserve overtime for her mistake i already ask maintenance to help me set it up she will just have to talk with current gm tomorrow i just tell the supervisor it s no big deal if i don t put down the half hour since it wa my mistake but laundry lady wa already texting the gm about the horror she witnessed so my supervisor just got a text telling her to tell me just to go home for the day now about week later here i am pulled into the office after another stressful na i didn t ask for and finally talked to about the incident except i had talked already with the gm about missing the meeting room and how am laundry seemed perfectly fine with setting it up themselves like day after when i got the chance to talk with her and apologized for the mistake the whole time i m sitting there and my gm is saying she told me to get it done the day before the day i didn t work i tell her i didn t work on that date i worked the day after she said she didn t care it wa my job even though for the past day both the other na and pm could have got it done according to the meeting folder to set up the meeting room then she began vaguely threatening me with my job saying your super awesome at taking constructive criticism and you don t have to worry about losing your job or anything unless this happens every time on your shift not saying it will or i am expecting it to since your good at correcting thing right away don t lose any sleep over this it s just going to sit in your file three more and your suspended but don t worry about losing your job right away your doing great here i have the full conversation recorded and with me denying i wa ever told i wa specifically told to have the meeting room set up on that date also explaining why the supervisor wouldn t let me correct my mistake which she claim i said the meeting room wasn t my priority when i only said i wasn t able to get to that part of the shift right up until the supervisor arrived and we were talking about something that reminded me of the meeting room i never used the language priority with her this gm doesn t investigate incident nor remembers conversation when it s convenient for her she also rarely work and is hard to get a hold of if your na to discus problem hell i suspect she wrote me up only because i refused a shift last week because of my other job and i wasn t willing to cover a shift with only mintues of warning before said shift fuck this i m recording this crap and a soon a i can snag a fulltime or part time she forced me on casual despite promising hr at least at time of hiring i am going to compile a full report and send it off to both her bos and labour amp standard for investigation formally i should at least get my she owes me because she forgot my scheduled raise until another employee noticed and complained yet refused back pay if she s already threatening me i know exactly where this bullshit is heading and i need to make sure i can get a hold of my lawyer to clean this up in case it hit a fan sorry if this rant doesn t fit but it seems to be a theme of poor management and pattern i ve observed from her past poorly managed place

so my roommate and i came up with an idea for award superlative for the our holiday party for the restaurant i ve got some pretty good idea so far but i need a few more potentially category specific one for bartender and food runner but i ll take any suggestion or idea for any all area thank you guy
so i wa responding to another redditors tale and my response turned into a long assed story of my own so i figured i should not post there so i ll make my own amp x b i absolutely hate the one that don t get that they cannot check in at midnight because it s now whatever date they want it to be i had a lady last saturday night she made her reservation online using point at am for sunday she showed up shortly after booking after not finding her in the arrival i did a search so i wa like oh well your reservation is for sunday first she tell me that it is sunday i had to explain to her that while it is past midnight it is still saturday check in time for sunday start at pm now she had enough point to use to get a discount so you know she understands that it s not sunday after i explain that she change her story to well i booked at pm on saturday i told them when i made the reservation that i needed it for saturday and they said it wa ok while my brand can be booked past midnight they have to call u prior because they can t see if we ve run the audit yet so they need to know what day to book and all that good stuff i never got a call the room type would not have been available to be booked for saturday she booked it at am and she booked it online there wa no they involved so i started there i told her that she booked through the website and at what time she booked she didn t like that very much i also explained that since she is using point i cannot modify this reservation at the property level not me being a dick those field are not editable on our side i could provide her with the reservation number and would authorize a late reservation but since it wa for saturday the rate would go up and her room type would have to be a different one than what she want because it s presently occupied she asked about early check in i wa like well that will depend on the morning staff and the time the room becomes available for housekeeping to do their thing turn out even after explaining everything rather well i think she actually meant early check in a in just check her in now i started at the beginning and went through it all again again telling her all she had to do wa call the reservation line she left no showed sunday so i ran her a such so we still got the point reimbursement her complaint to corporate wa of course wildly different than what i ve described like ridiculously so she left out the entire saturday night thing she left out the fact that she wa trying to check in a day early or that i referred her back to them her complaint stated that i just flat out told them they had a reservation but didn t have a room for them and there wa nothing i could do so they were left stranded in town and had to sleep in her car even though there are other hotel within a block and all visible from our parking lot she also went on a smaller rampage complaining about how rude and nasty the girl on sunday morning wa apparently getting an early check in didn t go her way i replied with a very thorough retelling of the event they had already given her her point back though which is bullshit i m not technically the one that responds to complaint but i could not let that go without providing the actual fact i know they don t care but i do
yesterday wa saturday most of you know friday night and saturday night are the busiest at the hotel we have an indoor pool so this time of year we get a lot of entitled people wanting to use the pool tax time also lead to a lot of local riffraff coming in we have been having trouble with pool towel disappearing we get new one in put them out and then next thing i know we only have again endless cycle well i wa working alone and like it always happens i got a rush of room trying to check in all at once i m just doing my thing knocking them out smiling and keeping the crowd happy about three room into the line i notice a man ha walked into the lobby and is standing off to the side he is in his swim trunk completely dry i smile at him showing that i see him and then continue the line i get through another room and then he decides to tell out in the lobby excuse me we need towel down in the pool i looked up from the counter at him pretty shocked i looked at the line who are all also looking at this man and then back at him to respond yes sir i am the only one here so it s gonna be a few minute i will get them down there a soon a i can the man then look at me mouth wide open a if he expected me to drop the line in front of me to take towel down to the pool remember he wasn t even in line he wa standing off to the side he roll his eye throw up his hand and say this place is unbelievable he then turn and walk back down towards the pool i obviously have a look of surprise on my face because the guest i wa in the middle of helping said wow i continued checking the line in got it knocked out went to the laundry room and got a cart of the regular bathroom towel no more pool towel to be found anywhere and start the walk down i walk into the pool area to see the entitled man in the pool with his wife he look up roll his eye at me again and say well that took ya long enough i put on my fake customer service smile and apologize in the back of my mind i m trying to figure out what the rush is he is still in the pool so he obviously didn t need them yet but i just put the towel on the shelf and walk out some day i hate people
i interviewed for a server job at a local restaurant not a chain a few week ago and never heard back today they called me back asking me to come interview for a server job after my first interview i called them and the person i talked to said they thought they had a full staff any advice for my second interview i have a stutter btw think that one of their other hire backed out
okay so this just happened a few second ago i had this dude call the property and ask if he could use his hotel coupon to get a room at the hotel brand i work at now i ve been here fucking year now and i ve never heard of using coupon for a room not any message from corporate or anything from my manager about how to put a rate like that in so i asked if maybe he wa looking at an online price and he said no that he wa looking in a coupon book he got for travel i told him that he could bring it in so i could look at it because we were currently on the phone mind you and that i could see what that wa because i ve never heard of a coupon being used to anything close to our property brand amp x b after hanging up the phone i immediately call my gm and ask her so um do we have coupon for room to be dollar anywhere and she wa like uhhhh no why and i explain to her what this dude just said and she wa confused a well she said to let him show it to me and see what the hell it wa because she had no idea what on earth it could be from i could offer him one of the main at most discount rate but that wa it amp x b so he come in around minute later with a coupon book that offer an dollar rate for our property but doesn t have our number listed but some other phone number you are supposed to call it said just to show it at check in and that we would give them the rate um i can t be crazy right like this isn t real i tell him the number isn t ours and that while i see that it say this i m not applying it because after i hung up with him i called my manager and she didn t know what it wa either there wasn t anything in our system to let me change the price to that rate amp x b he said that he wa aware that the number wasn t ours and had to google our number but still wanted the rate i told him that i couldn t give it to him because no offence to him but the coupon didn t look legit and since my manager didn t know what it wa the lowest i could give them wa a one of our discount rate him and his wife i m assuming didn t like that and said that why can t they just get the employee rate since he work with our brand doing stuff i said is he ha a way to book it online and get his employee rate then that wa fine but i can t just give out the employee rate to people who say they are employee amp x b he said he didn t want to do that and honestly this encounter wa getting sketchier a it went on he then asked for another hotel of our brand in the area and i told him one about minute away and he went on his way do hotel use coupon like i m legitimately wondering because i ve never heard of this and not like free stay voucher but like from those high school coupon book coupon

i swear if i have to deal with making one more reservation on the phone in which someone say their name and address at lightning speed expecting me to get all the perfect detail from it one more time i m gonna flip my lid not to mention when they are driving in their car and their phone is on speaker and i can t hear a damn word they are saying because all i can hear is your mumbled voice and the fucking ac blasting because you have your phone in your cup holder and then you get mad at me when i can only hear the bare minimum excuse me i ve gotten to the point where when they say it all super fast i just deadpan ask for all the detail slow a fuck and take my sweet time making sure everything is spelt perfectly by going over every letter just read slightly slower than usual please i beg of you
my favorite restaurant in town a small but extremely popular breakfast lunch place recently went from counter service to table service note that rds of their seating is outdoors which is fine except that they won t seat there even in nice weather with the table service and when we enter the hostess doesn t approach u she wait until there s like or party and then take the name in a random order my boyfriend and i came twice in january but walked out because we were waiting min to be seated while there were plenty of open table we went this weekend and endured the wait but the service wa just awful it took like min to get water my drink and entree were wrong i didn t send them back because they were both kinda edible the server wa trying and new though i tipped and felt bad about it and left a note asking for better service i love that place and the server they just need to get their act together we went to a popular ice cream chain restaurant yesterday mind you i m allergic to almond not severely enough to worry about slight cross contamination but if i consume almond i ll have an incredibly itchy throat and some difficulty breathing usually just a benadryl and ton of water make me feel safe i don t carry an epi pen because it s really easy to avoid almond after choosing my ice cream flavor both nutty but not almond the server asked if whipped cream cherry and nut were okay i completely didn t hear nut so i said yes then he handed it to me with almond basically everywhere on it i felt bad but asked him to remake it because i m allergic and didn t hear him say it he questioned me on being allergic to almond but not pecan or walnut but he remade it and i apologized for misunderstanding
i m a barista and in our store we offer stamp card similar to purdys if you buy drink you get the th one free now on our card it quite clearly state that in two section the first in the last little icon where you stamp it say next drink free and also at the very top of the card in big bold letter buy drink and get next one free a lady came in today headphone in talking on her phone and start to order her drink in chinese i softly tell her that i don t understand and she proceeds to try to order in english she state that she ha a free drink and she rudely demand that i combined her stamp card together by her tone of her voice and attitude based on this second interaction i complied because i knew that she d cause a scene if i didn t we usually try not to combine the card but in most case it depends whose working i usually combine them for people who are nice haha the lady acquired stamp on her stamp card and she asked me to combine them which mean that she ha stamp therefore the next drink she order is free she decides to order two drink so she would have to pay for the price of one drink since she s redeemed her free drink from the card i ask her if she wanted to start a new stamp card i receive the silent nod and then i give her the new card with one stamp on it now here here is where i wish i never asked if she wanted a new card because she rip her headphone off and loudly demand why do i only have one stamp i should have two so i start to explain to her that since i combined the card for her stamp stamp it meant that the th drink wa free since she collected stamp i m also pointing to the area where it say this on the card this entire time i m explaining to her she begin to sigh and raise her voice even more saying that she should have two stamp since she bought two and that the th drink is free even though it clearly say the next one th one is free i repeat to her again that she must have stamp on her stamp card to qualify for the free drink and she fulfilled that requirement by having me combine the stamp card together she begin to raise her voice even more saying that it s ridiculous that that s the rule for the free drink qualification to which i just show her the card again pointing to the text that say you must have earned stamp for free drink she sigh super loudly and point at me and utters something i didn t understand in chinese probably because she knew i didn t understand chinese i wa honestly shocked at her level of entitlement i witnessed today i never thought i could experience something like this working a a barista when i worked in retail i wa used to this so it wasn t a out of the blue a something like this especially over a cup of tea
godspeed everyone
so because it s valentine s day tonight at the restaurant wa incredibly busy tonight because i m in australia so we re a bit ahead i work the bar at a busy restaurant and really there should be two people working the bar one to wash all the glass and run drink along with another who just make the drink ala it s just me trying to do a billion job at once it wa super busy and i wa getting very frustrated and overwhelmed but a the night quietened down a big group who had been there for a couple hour ordered some drink i made them and ran them out and a i wa placing them down one of the guy at the table lean over and say you re doing solid work there mate we ve been watching you all night and you ve been getting smashed but you re doing well it made my day just wanted to share
it always seems like drunk guest reveal their most unflattering side of themselves so here is a story of such an interaction i ve worked in hotel at the front desk for over year so i have my fair share the first hotel i worked at wa on a college campus so we were commonly booked out with guest arriving to watch football game of course these guest are never just here to watch a football game they re also here to tailgate and go to bar some people would start tailgating a early a in the morning so they were constantly drinking all day it doesn t help that in our city there wa many bar directly on campus which were about a minute walk from a hotel so many guest checked in already hammered on football night a lady and what i assumed to be her husband come to check in at night i assume the lady is in her late s or early s i guess i could have known from checking her id but i don t normally pay attention to the age when i m checking guest s id so i m checking her in and she proceeds to tell me that i look handsome and so i blush then say thank you then she proceeds to tell me that i can sleep in her bed tonight after which i blush even harder and awkwardly and uncomfortably laugh mind you this wa with what i assume to be her husband standing right next to her then she proceeds to ask me if i m specifically year old to which i respond no i m year old and i proceed to be totally creeped out and confused then the guest left me alone after that and i didn t hear back from her
a post in another sub shook this teenage memory loose so i figured i d share it when i wa a kid i used to work school break at my uncle s golf course i did a little of whatever wa needed but mostly i wa behind the desk in the pro shop ringing up green fee cart rental etc and making tee time reservation one summer this absolute twatwaffle wa trying to get me to bend the rule for him and his buddy about tee time and wa being a bit of a bully because i wa a young girl when i wouldn t give in to his crap of course he pulled a you know mr l your bos well i m really good friend with him i d hate to have to call him and tell him how unhelpful you ve been i responded with i do know mr l but i call him uncle r and i know for a fact he ll be on my side want me to call and check he of course backpeddled in a hurry it turn out he did know my uncle everyone who golfed there knew him he basically bought the place so he could play golf all day and socialize and i saw them in the bar later chatting i went up to my uncle and gave him a hug and while standing there with my arm around him asked the other guy how did that tee time turn out for you and your friend any issue he stumbled for a second and then assured me that everything wa great nothing super exciting but it gave me a chuckle to remember so i figured i d share
this happened year ago i wa and working for a large prestigious law firm i had to fly with a senior partner and the general counsel who wa our client to another city for a case these are two older men who both have a large paycheck and have the attitude that can come with it before we leave for the airport the secretary that made the hotel arrangement told both of them tonight there is no suite available but you will have a suite tomorrow and for the rest of your stay she told them this more than once we get to the hotel guess who stand at the front desk demanding a suite and making a scene i just stood to the side looking horrified waiting for my room key they finally got room with an adjoining door for that one night then they fussed about it in the elevator i told his secretary when we got back and she wasn t surprised she said she knew they would do that i just don t get how people can act that way the hotel cannot magically make a suite available just because they think they are special
i mainly work late night like till am so naturally i cannot sleep until like am sleep through most of the day until my next shift and repeat they asked me to take an emergency party of last night for this morning and those kind of party are great money so of course i said hell yeah then also work the normal floor after double but i also worked super late last night so i couldn t fall asleep until the usual am the alarm clock app on my phone apparently glitched out and force closed while i wa asleep a random number called me which woke me up also seeing the notification that unfortunately alarm app ha stopped that woke me up minute after i wa supposed to be there so i frantically got ready and sped over gm wa pretty mad and tried to send me home but i refused it wa a legit technological error even though it still is my fault i had no intention of running late so i wa able to stay and made good money i should call that random number just to thank them for calling and waking me up because i m sure i would of still been asleep for way longer lol
i had to wait on a group at the beginning of my serving career who i still get nervous about seeing whenever they come in table wa comprised of parent and teenager while i wa taking order the dad presumably got a facetime call i had already taken his order i don t think it s rude if you take a call a long a you ve already communicated your order to somebody however the man turned his phone around to show me to whoever he wa facetiming it wa the front camera and i could see his entire screen throughout their entire visit i felt uncomfortable and kept seeing him pick up his phone in suspicious angle which made me feel like he wa taking picture video of me i wa a pretty popular cam model a little over a year ago and it made me feel like he recognized me from there and wa showing me off obviously this is kinda self absorbed to think but why would you take photo facetime of your waitress at a normal sport bar without telling her the worst part is his wife didn t say a single thing to him and even got mad at him for overtipping me when imo if i m gonna be your model for the night i should get paid extra amp x b tldr a guest repeatedly took picture of me and facetimed to his friend what i looked like made me very very nervous a i wa a popular camgirl before this job and i have a constant fear of somebody recognizing me ever since this happened i ve been paranoid it how do i get over this situation footnote like i said in the title i m mainly venting with that said refrain from commenting unless you think i m in the right or have anything useful to add i don t want to see any question about why it matter because i ve explained why it matter thank you for your understanding
it s a long one tldr at the end about year ago i worked the front desk of a rather nice hotel off a highway in kansa this particular part of the state wa pretty empty but wa on the route to several important place most of the guest were nice a few hard to please people here and there luckily i worked night so usually by the time i started most of the guest had already checked in those who came later at night were usually tired from traveling long distance they just wanted to check in and go to sleep some people were night owl and would hang around to talk usually that wasn t a problem but sometimes on the night of this story it wa am the time i cancel any unclaimed reservation is am i have one paper notice still sitting in the reservation box i m about to start the final audit for the night when the automatic door slide open i smelled him before i saw him stumble in looked like late forty early fifty obviously drunk and carrying no suitcase i straighten up and brace for the unexpected instead of yelling or making demand the guy asks how my night is and if he s still in time to claim his room i laughed and said you just made it are you soandso that s me his speech is slurred he reached forward and put a supporting hand on the counter do i need to do anything just show me an id and let me scan a credit card i reply with a smile he say nothing just fumble for his wallet he hand over the thing i asked for i start entering the information out of the corner of my eye i see the guy eyeing me up it s horribly obvious probably because of how drunk he wa it s not a new thing you get all kind after all three week into the job i had started wearing a ring so i could tell customer that hit on me that i wa taken though truthfully i wa single at the time a i hand the guy his key and an envelope with breakfast ticket he grabbed my hand softly you re really beautiful he say in a sort of creepy way he probably thought wa sexy i somehow manage to keep my cool and smile a i take my hand back thanks it s just the standard uniform will there be anything else are you single he asks clearly just going for it thanks to the liquid courage no i m married i say with a smile a i flash my fake ring the tension that had been building in me started to ease this is where all the people who hit on me normally backed off i won t tell if you don t he say with a sloppy wink while flashing me a ring of his own now i just feel sick not only is this guy drunk and creepy he s married too i frown i m really not interested and i think it s time for you to go to your room i point to my left the elevator is just over there the guy s smile remains wide a he make a show of trying to peek around the corner without actually moving where he kind of sound like he s trying not to laugh i sigh just there i make an extra turning motion a i point again literally just around that corner i can t see it he say in that same tone still not moving more than his head he shoot me a creepy look and wiggle his eyebrow while saying could you come out here and show me the door that lead to the front desk area is foot from the elevator door it close quickly and lock automatically so i say sure copy me i gesture in the direction he should go while walking over to the door making a bit of show of turning the knob he beam wider and rush around the corner i poke my top half out of the crack i ve made in the doorway and point directly at the elevator they are right there your room is on the third floor have a good night i shut the door before he can reply and run into the laundry room the tv with the camera feed on it is in there because that is also where the manager s desk is i watch the man stand there for about a minute before getting in the elevator only when i see him exit it on the third floor do i sigh in relief my eye scan the other camera feed mostly out of habit and i see it a big truck still running is parked right in front of the main door there is no one inside curious i investigate sure enough the truck is still running it s also taken up all the space where people usually unload their suitcase for family member or hotel staff to take inside the door are unlocked so i peek inside the whole thing reek of booze only then doe it really click that super drunk creepy guy drove here himself also the truck is a stick i can t drive stick which mean i can t move the truck even if i wanted to so instead i just turn the car off and take the car key inside the next thirty minute go normally i ve calmed down and moved on with my night i almost shit myself when the phone start to ring the guest phone hardly ever ring after pm unless something is very wrong i answer the phone quickly hello this is front desk what can i help you with the voice on the other end is instantly recognizable my tv remote won t work i look down at the display on the phone and confirm my fear it wa the room belonging to creepy drunk i hold in a sigh and respond have you made sure it s set to aux that tended to be a problem for some reason just press the button that say a u x the light should flash red nothing happened creepy drunk say without pause the light didn t come on a short pause can you come up here and fix it for me the tone wa like rotten honey i shivered no i said firmly if you come down here with it i can give you a replacement we had a whole drawer of spare just in case will there be anything else please i really need you up here i just know something is wrong with the tv no you can either come get a new remote or wait for maintenance they get here at am then i hung up normally i wouldn t do that it s super rude but he wa drunk and freaking me out i m the only one working no one would notice if i vanished for a few hour and it wa obvious this guy wanted to live out some sort of hotel fantasy it truly felt like he wa trying to turn his night into an adult film for the next few hour i locked myself in the back room i did paperwork and watched the camera all wa quiet eventually i felt safe enough to walk the hall in order to slip receipt under door a i try to be silent i start to go over the breakfast stuff i need to complete downstairs in my head i work mostly on autopilot until i get to the third floor door after door i slip paper through crack i had just finished slipping paper under another door when i hear the one behind me open i had slipped a receipt under that door just a few second ago assuming i had maybe woken someone somehow i turned with an apology on my lip but nothing came out i couldn t breath the paper slipped from my hand creepy drunk wa just standing there he wa staring at my butt and he wa naked fear filled my whole body and a he reached out a hand like an invitation i bolted i ran all the way down the stair and locked myself in the back room with my eye fixed on camera feed i called the police it only took a few sentence to relate what wa needed the woman on the phone talked to me for the next few minute she kept asking if i wa safe and i said it looked like creepy drunk wa still in his room when the police show up on the camera i hang up and greet them already long story short i give the officer a keycard and lock myself back in the back room i call my manager to let her know what is happening luckily the guy doesn t put up much of a fight no yelling or denial just a guy in sweatpants staring at the floor i quit that job not long after i just never felt safe there again amp x b tldr creepy drunk try to hit on me i say no so he end up flashing me i call the police and soon quit my job

hey all night auditor here i have a fun short little tale for everyone from tonight i get in to hear that there are a few angry people on property so it go i suppose i walk to front desk to see a monitor with maybe half of the display working apparently one of the day shift darling mistook the phone for a football and spiked it into the screen before i came in for the night now i m just genuinely hoping none of the aforementioned angry people come in requesting any info from the right side of my screen

after year of weird as customer that have zero concept of personal space i finally told one to bugger off started with the usual crap of why don t you have a phone charger can i have your lighter also known a the game of how many of my possession do you think you re entitled to and lucky me i know you re understaffed but i had to wait second for a drink this service is awful whilst legging it up and down the stair to ensure that these knob have had their fill of tequila i wa grabbed by the wrist we can t let you leave we need you here for u now i m familiar with drunkard but every time someone touch me at work i have a bad habit of freezing not this time i glared at this booze ridden as and for the first time held my ground you can politely ask for a drink but if you even try to man handle me so that you can get shot then you can first consider your lack of empathy and then realise how dumb you ll look getting booted from your own party whilst i m busy self congratulating after my triumph the pickled asswipe retreat into the crowd lesson learned entitled drunk back down easy
so i m a front desk agent and i am unbelievably frustrated at my manager because of how she treated an interaction with a guest i ve never posted here but i figured hey maybe i ll get some sympathy karma and i want to bitch and complain so here s the tale i call the manager that never followed through on her threat it all started particularly normally it s a decently busy night at the insert brand here i m the only front desk agent on duty but my manager is popping on to help when it get busy we just had a rush of people so she had popped on to help cut the line down and wa just finishing thing on her end when he walked in you ever just know that someone s gonna be a problem this wa that perfectly encapsulated it wa an older couple but the woman immediately sat down while he approached the desk i give him the standard greeting all smile and pep and his response is my name is insert name here i am a top tier extra shiny and special member with brand name are there any free upgrade available the way he said it got across that he wasn t asking he wa telling me that he wanted a free upgrade great start but you know what whatever it s not that busy he s a cubic zirconium no skin off my back if i give him a pair of slipper and a robe to keep him happy let me see if we have anything available i say a i begin looking to see if we have any decent view but i barely get a chance to even look before he pipe up with his next demand how doe the parking work ahh the parking somehow i knew that this wa going to be the straw that broke the camel s back our parking is unique we are at a downtown location so there is a small fee all the other hotel in the area have similar fee and ours is actually a dollar or two cheaper than some of our competitor for parking the parking garage we use is technically owned by the city and we just rent a certain amount of space from them so there is really not any negotiation about parking we charge because we get charged for it end of story the parking is directly behind u it s come and go a you please it s all by your license plate there is a small fee of when i booked i specifically checked if the parking is free i never pay for parking and it told me on the app that it s free i immediately know that s wrong we get people complaining about paying for parking all the time you d almost believe that we were really the only hotel in the world that ha the audacity to charge for parking so i know for a fact that everywhere you can book from the reservation line to the app to online reservation vendor none of them say free parking we dealt with all those year ago i pipe up with something along the line of i apologize for the confusion sir but there is a small charge for parking if you can show me where it say we have free parking i might be able to do something about it i say knowing full well that it doesn t say there s free parking but he dig his phone out and after a second or two of scrolling he shove it in my face where i read this message gt parking is available at location across the street please make sure to stop by the front desk to give your license plate to avoid additional fee he must have seen parking is available and read it a parking is absolutely free babyyyyyyyy woooooooooo but nowhere on here doe have the word free so that s what i tell him i apologize for the confusion but the message say parking is available and you need to give u your plate in order to avoid getting a parking ticket like i said it s city parking they ll ticket your as in second flat if you re not in our system up to this point i ve been trying to use direct quote or at least semi accurate paraphrase but i don t exactly remember what happened next because he went into a tirade and started ranting about how he never pay for parking and threatening to leave and go somewhere else and blahblahblahblahwahwahwah this is also the point where my manager step in they went back and forth for a while with my manager playing hard damage control and douchey guest continuing to threaten to raze hell over all coalescing into him grabbing his stuff and walking out at which point my manager say if you leave now we ll have to charge you for a late cancellation he come back asks her for her name demand to have her business card and the business card of the general manager and he say if you charge me for this bullshit there will be hell to pay before he stomp out his wife quietly behind in tow at this point i ve already written up the note on the reservation that the guest wa informed that there would be charge and not to waive the cancellation fee i am prepared to charge this asshole he wa clearly wrong at every step and he tried to threaten and bully his way to free parking and a waived fee my manager step out back to write up a guest incident report in case he try to escalate this with the brand i am feeling good about the situation and then my manager come up and tell me that me that if he come back we are to offer him free parking and she ha set up the reservation to waive the late cancel fee what the fuck i ll admit here i wa looking forward to charging him i wanted him to throw a stink and waste his time and energy ranting and raving with a furiosity that would make the little spat here pale in comparison i hate bully and dude wa blatantly and obviously bullying his way through the world this wa sweet well deserved and totally compliant with our operating standard and procedure revenge and i am flabbergasted that she s willing to forgo it i even called her out on it i directly asked why we were doing this and she said because it s not worth the trouble and i m the manager like yeah you are the manager and what you say go but why why are we making an exception here for this trio of goblin stapled together in the rough shape of a person when we are clearly in the right i have the strangest feeling that if this happened when she wasn t here and i waived the late cancel fee and offered free parking i d be getting a stern talking to by her the next day but the fact that she s a manager mean she just ha different rule to play by i guess so there that s my rant story doe anyone else have stuff like this happen to them am i crazy here by trying to hold him accountable for his douchey action this isn t the first time i ve felt like this about my manager action before but it s certainly the most egregious event of this nature i ve experienced since i started jesus this ended up being a lot longer than i meant it to be sorry
long time lurker first time poster i ll try to keep this short two guy pull up in a now very obviously rented corvette and they refuse to go park it in the lot they have to have it front and center and don t move it for any other guest to get around they have chain on iced out watch the whole they ve got a code and a form to use our f amp f rate too which is maybe plus inc so the total for one night wa barely they also wanted an upgrade to a suite but we didn t have any available the card declined they both stand in the lobby talking about how they tour with so many big name and big rapper how they re flying in and out of ny and la i try to make conversation while they get fund transferred but really can t do much else especially because the big bos wa trying to check them in i m still in training so i had to just watch and take everything in and small talk them they were friendly enough but after a while they specifically wanted me to go show them their room they refused to go with anyone else but me until finally our security took them up they started talking bad about me to security apparently very vulgar stuff who eventually tell them to quit show them the room then brings them back down basically after two hour of u not budging on letting them in and their card declining they left to try another property oh and they also pulled out a wad of cash from their pocket at least and had s laying all over the backseat of their rented car
so here i am starting my shift i m printing report and doing my thing and down come a young couple not super young but i m getting old and they re younger than me dude cool tatts man where d ya get it i have a rather nice sleeve if i do say so myself and i wear a polo me thanks i got it when i lived in texas dude oh didn t get it around here me yeah no not around here none of the shop around here are all that good dude oh do you like music me i do like music dude cool i like music too they re either drunk or slightly stoned legal here i don t normally post thing outside of bitching but it caught me off guard and it wa slightly cute we also have the drag queen in house and my rather steady chick that the casino pay for coming in tonight it might be a tolerable evening
i work at a small cafe in a park only one server on the weekday and two on the weekend and there s a group that come in pretty regularly i have to take a deep sigh whenever i see them it s two lady and an older man and it s the same routine every time they order around two item and a drink and when i tell them the total they all feign shock at the high price and omit almost their whole order and leave with a drink every time yet they keep coming back so today they came in and ordered a panini i told them the total wa not including tax a minute of are you sure and that s so expensive pass until one of the lady give me in single and a fist full of dime and quarter and tell me to ring it up so i can tell her how much she still owes me including the tax mind you her whole group wa sitting outside rather than coming inside to the cash register i take another deep sigh i count it all and come back outside and tell her the remaining amount is she hand me two fist full of penny and some quarter and tell me that should be enough i had penny scattered over the entire inside of the cash register podium counting her penny she gave me around worth of penny didn t even bother to count why do people do this
so genuine question for all of you normally i would post a story but nothing interesting ha happened a of late but for the past hour i keep getting people coming into my hotel and most of them either ask or i see their pet and when i let them know that unless they are a service animal we do not allow pet every single one ha asked me can i just pay a pet fee obviously i tell them no but are there some place that even though they do not allow pet they will allow them into the hotel but the guest will be charged a pet fee i mean obviously if the guest check in and we find they snuck in a pet then of course we charge them the fee i mean most not pet friendly property that i know of do but so some place charge up front like that
this happened a while ago but i felt inspired by some of the free cancellation post on here tonight we had a guest call u because she wanted to cancel her room that night free of charge due to her partner being sick we declined the request but advised her to contact fecking com because they are who she booked with we then get a call from someone at fecking com asking if we d allow the same guest to cancel free of charge because her nephew got into a car accident and wa in hospital i know i wa just a confused no mention of a sick partner in the conversation at all just her nephew being in hospital do some people not realise that they call u too
just a mini rant here mobile formatting sorry desktop user our pool hour are posted in multiple place and we inform guest of them at check in and yet i ll still come in for night audit and there will be people genuinely surprised that i m showing up to kick them out and lock the door i feel like i m pretty nice about it too the pool close at and i usually won t head over until sometimes the people in there simply didn t realize what time it wa and they ll leave promptly if they need to change or anything i ll say you know what no hurry i ll come back in or minute so you don t feel rushed but sometimes i ve had guest just refuse to leave or they try to beg me to keep it open usually drunk people i can t stand it when i give them the old okay i ll be back in but then they haven t budged when i come back grown as adult will whine at me for more minute in the pool some night it s bad enough that i want to tell them i m not your mommy if you need someone to drag you out by your ear then i d be happy to call the police for you thankfully it s never escalated to that
while we were during the slow season at the hotel with about check in it wa fine to be alone because we were sitting at a cool gt occupancy and i never really felt like i saw most guest besides checking them in now we are picking up to averaging about every day only hit that when we have a big group coming in i went from literally sitting in the back office watching video on my phone stuffing my face with whatever sounded good on postmates to not being able to take a lunch break or any break at all waiting for a second of peace so i can put the front desk agent will return momentarily sign up and run up stair to try and go to the bathroom i say try because i m usually full of anxiety and knowing the second i walk back downstairs there is going to be a line of people we have a mid shift from am pm which help with the check in but i think the real problem is after the guest are checked in if we are around we should always have people at the desk all night mainly because most of those people that checked in now want pillow blanket towel need the wifi password calling to ask general question ect it is alot for one person i am checking in a guest and having two people calling me at the same time putting them both on hold only to have them hang up and call me back a minute later asking me why i put them on hold so long with two people it is great because you can both take a call check a guest in or what i like to do is take turn so no one is answering majority of the call or checking in majority of the guest honestly i am getting a little burned out i am fine and peppy until about pm which is my usual lunch break time i use that to get a great meal in and watch a you tube video or a minute episode of a tv show it s a great way to kind of shut my brain off and relax for a uninterrupted minute then when pm hit i can sense my mood and demeanor change i will say everything with my customer service voice but my expression is more blank emotionless tired by pm i am begging to go home using the last bit of my energy to explain to the night auditor about the night to pas on any note and to change and finally go home gm say i got approved by corporate to up our budget so we will be able to have people at the front desk again finally peace

few year ago i wa working in a hotel that s very luxurious and had a long history in london at the hotel we often serve royalty and celebrity one busy afternoon a of everyday a group of people came in for afternoon tea and i wa assigned to serve them we have a set menu of pastry scone and cake and all you have to choose is the tea that you d like to have with your cake one man in the group had a grumpy face the whole time he wa there he didn t even look into the menu and said that he wanted tea cake i told him i m sorry sir we have no tea cake but i can offer you scone it s the closest that we have to tea cake smile he definitely seem annoyed and said what how can a place like this have no tea cake i said if you can give me a moment i will ask our chef if we can find you any smile i took the order from the rest of the table and went to ask our pastry chef around the kitchen if they can find me any tea cake none of the chef have any so i ll just have to serve him scone i went back to let him know and he burst at me saying something along the line of such a big hotel with it tradition and history and you can t find me a simple tea cake how can a hotel like this doesn t serve any tea cake i am completely baffled and this is unacceptable i am making an official request to your head chef right here i name not gonna name him here just in case i get in trouble gt lt a member of the parliament is making a statement and request to your head chef that a hotel such a this should have and serve tea cake you should have it in the menu bla bla bla i looked around his table and i can see his friend are looking at me apologetically and mouthing sorry to me i briefly told this to my manager and went back to work from the way that he s speaking and telling me his name and such i m guessing he s an important person but honestly i m not from the uk so i don t really care and really didn t know who he is
all my colleague decided to direct the french customer to me whenever they had a complaint i noticed they were always annoyed and sometimes it is our fault sometimes not here s one case that stood out for how entitled the french guy wa he had room in a grand villa style where technically it s separate room but arranged together to form a huge room with a courtyard two pool and sunbathing area that day we were thinking he wanted to pay for the other half of the room which wasnt paid for yet he come to reception pissed off and shoving his phone in my face saying there are worm in my room and you said minute ago you will be there no housekeeping ha been there yet trying my best to make sure we re not at fault i respond sir those are termite they exist naturally and it s literally a never ending war between u and them you notice how most of the hotel is now plastic and painted steel that s because we had to replace the wood with those material there only one housekeeper working the evening shift after pm so he ha a lot of work on his hand but i ll go to your room to check it for you oh fuck now it becomes my problem the french guy s mum ha asked the housekeeper to fumigate the room not knowing that obviously poison is used in the mix so now it becomes my problem the thing that get me is he make a big fuss about every little detail like wow you don t clean your room and what happens for two week when we sometimes leave room checked however unclean because we are short on manpower and there are other room which need to be cleaned a this room will be vacant for week then i get to the process of his aforementioned payment a i did not know if he wanted to pay tonight i didn t prepare his invoice this took minute however with him breathing his sigh at me fussing insulting groaning and acting like a toddler not getting their toy he said thing like oh because it is you it is slow sop for invoice at check out is the night audit will print out all invoice for u since he ha the entire night to do so and morning shift simply take the complete invoice and show them to the customer when they check out he wa pretty arrogant in trying to show that he had a thai airway platinum amex card which i had to see the benefit of afterwards turn out it ha an insane interest rate so i feel happy that he had his money taken away he once again said can i get any compensation for the termite i honestly fucking lost my cool at this point respectfully sir a i said we are not responsible for the action of mother nature then realising i raised my voice at the prick and for u it is a never ending war between them the fumigation is an unforgivable mistake however your mother wa the person who asked to start the fumigation this wa verbally confirmed and therefore we are not fully responsible we will not compensate for the action of mother nature tbh at this point i think something inside him realise he wa being a total dick to me he lowered his voice and changed his tone to a soft one i then decided why not give him one cocktail per over in his group so i asked him how many over s were travelling with him and gave him that many cocktail voucher i still haven t seen him write a review on any ota site and i hope he doesn t because i know he s definitely going to make a mountain out of a termite hill question for other redditors are french people normally like this or is this guy an especially big dick
hey haven t posted a tale in awhile here had some doozies but this one is the most recent see this morning we had noticed a shady man hanging around the hotel lobby and chatting with a guest that we already had our eye on for other shady behavior they go up to his room and are there for awhile then we see him come down back down to the lobby until we decide that he need to go security talk to the guy and he end up leaving later on that morning our houseperson is cleaning the lower lobby restroom off of the breakfast area and find hundred dollar bill in one of the stall being a responsible employee they bring it to the front desk to await it s owner however the crew instantly identify the bill to be fake normally u s currency doesn t have chinese character printed on the back a counterfeit pen confirmed that the bill were indeed fake before we could call the authority however who should appear at the desk but the shady man from earlier he walk up to the front desk and tell the desk staff yeah so i left a few counterfeit bill in the bathroom downstairs would i have them back excuse me but what obviously we tell him no but then he get all huffy and is like but that s my personal property you need to give it back to which we tell him that his personal property is highly illegal and we would be turning it into the authority he resigns his fate and leaf the hotel never to be seen again but wow what kind of audacity doe one need to have to openly admit that kind of stuff the kicker is when we called the police to report the counterfeit bill they told u that since it wa his property we should have given them back seriously our gm texted her neice who is a cop in a neighboring district and wa shocked that we got that answer from he metro pd we ended up calling our local secret service branch and they took in the bill for investigation

i have a question for receptionist here a we have never had this problem before how did you deal with a customer who arrived with an unpaid reservation with no card or cash so we had two guest from insert country name here arrive for a night stay they were booked in our cheapest room type and we upgraded them due to overbooking in their file it wa mentioned and highlighted reservation unpaid collect payment upon arrival i handled this check in initially and they explained they had no thai baht and no credit card i wa taken aback i called my manager over and she explained that we will have to use their passport a a deposit to make sure they don t leave the country we had an in house exchange place so i explained to them that they could go change their euro into thai baht and pay for the reservation they said they can go to an atm and grab money for the hotel room and they needed the euro a that wa their emergency cash then i got it they had maestro card which can t be used on the machine at least in thailand maestro debit don t work for some goddamn reason so i said to them that they can take the shuttle bus to the city to use an atm and or rent a bike so they can be able to have a form of transportation for a low cost by the way they still haven t paid and this happened this afternoon and it s currently near the end of my shift which end at pm my question for veteran receptionist is how should i deal with this in the future without getting manager involved edit should note that the property i work at is a star non chain property not a backpacker s hangout
this wa a few week ago and i didn t work that particular night where all hell broke loose at our hotel but i wa going through our dooking com sent message folder and saw our gm s response to a guest that made me go daaaaamnmmnn at about pm on a busy thursday night our entire pm went down for no reason and without any warning turned out the company had a server error meaning every single hotel that used the same software wa fucked and that they had no idea what caused it or how long it would take to get it back up but that wasn t all there wa a snowstorm that day temperature wa about c f at night it dropped even lower at around midnight our hot water stopped working because it wa so cold and some equipment exploded guest started blowing up the phone the na phoned our gm in a panic the gm frantically called up every plumbing company but nobody answered her call she told the na to try calling again at am and keep trying until someone answered in the mean time we tried to soothe the guest some were grumpy some understood some screamed the gm said to comp everybody s room once our pm wa back up that seemed to calm most of them down except one guy his dooking com message read a follows no hot water to take a shower for entire stay no bathtub a advised in the advertisement i should get a free night stay i had to go to another place to rent another hotel last minute to take a shower both day that is horrible both day stayed at your place had no hot water for a shower and no one came to clean the room at all i think a night free stay for another time of my choosing is in order for not providing basic room requirement also we had no bathtub a advised in the advertisement just a shower which we couldn t use anyways come on seriously you should have a plumber available to fix everything it the cost of doing business man note our room either had a shower or a tub and it s clearly stated everywhere and if this guy wanted a tub instead of the shower he could ve let u know but he didn t without the pm our hk wa fucked some hk didn t come in because of the storm double fucked they barely managed to flip reserved room and didn t have time or resource for some of our in house guest but did provide fresh towel hot water wa fixed the next morning either way i guess the message and his bad review made my gm finally snap her reply read a follow dear guest i understand that you weren t happy about the situation but thing do happen sometimes that are out of our control please kindly do not tell me how to manage my property we have been respectful and to all our guest that night who were affected we refunded them had a few laugh about it with them they understood that it wa due to the extreme cold when i did receive the call about the issue it wa midnight and let me tell you that none of the plumber that i called answered me we are in the great north also we did not charge you for both night furthermore the water wa fixed the very next morning so before you decide to be mean or lie make sure you do it for the right reason regard gm my gm is extremely nice and good humoured i ve never even seen her mad like ever so this really surprised me i guess it wa the stress of running property with no pm yeah our sister property wa fucked too pm finally went back up after whole day so all s good for now tl dr guy lie about hot water my gm put him in his place

kind of a vent rant apology in advance a it s am here and i m hour in to a night shift we had a guest book room with u for night for the next week a lot of guest when booking these kind of stay tend to go with the non refundable rate because it s cheaper than going with the option to include free cancellation or modification to the booking this particular guest seemed like a nice guy they re a group of workman i think doing a job in the local area and one of the three gave me some pizza when i wa having a rough night health wise which wa really sweet so their bos made the booking a non refundable yesterday and he came down earlier asking if we can cancel one of the room he had booked for next week we always make it clear whenever we do a booking that non refundable is non refundable which mean they cannot cancel or make change free of charge we do allow this under certain circumstance but at the moment we are awaiting renovation and can not afford to lose money due to that and it being such a quiet period for hotel we didn t allow this and politely reminded him of the term of non refundable booking now he kick off big time he start badmouthing my colleague and ranting about how he s going to make a review on crapadvisor about how we are a bad business and how we should allow him to cancel the room because it s good customer service blah blah blah the thing is we can and do reply to our crapadvisor review we had a similar situation in the past where they totally falsified a review and badmouthed the hotel because his company made a mistake double booking his room and we wouldn t let him cancel the room they had booked with u now we are not a fancy hotel we re a star place and one of the cheapest hotel in the city chance are this guy wa trying to cancel the room with u because he wa booked into somewhere a lot classier than u now back to today s guy he s yet to post his shitty review about u we told him straight if he doe do the crapadvisor route then we would reply with what truthfully happened and that it would make him look like an idiot not the exact word said but you get the idea for lying i get so fed up with people thinking that crapadvisor review are a good threat to get their own shiny snowflake way even when it s a complaint about something else not just policy people threaten to go to what we call social medium thinking it will scare u into giving them what we want not realising that when they do platform such a fecking com come to u for our side of the story or give u the option to post our side of the story a a reply to their lie i haven t seen tonight s douche since we spoke but chance are he ll find other reason to worm his greasy way to get what he want apology for the long post rant over i want my bed

yesterday i had a couple with a pretty easy order fried rice and beef and broccoli when i checked back after two minute they called me over and showed me their fried rice which wa raw gummy and basically completely inedible i got apologized profusely on the kitchen behalf and went right away to make another one five minute later i had a brand new fried rice from the chef and i brought out an additional beef and broccoli to complement their first one i let them know that i wa worried their beef and broccoli would get cold while they were waiting for their fried rice remake so i brought them a new one a luck would have it the second fried rice wa fucked too raw gummy basically disgusting to look at now i had a to get a manager visit fuck my manager kindly offered them free dessert to go we also took off the fried rice obviously and the coke off the check i must ve apologized about ten time but they were pretty cool about it and let me m know it wasn t my fault at the end they left me on literally made my night and i know we screwed up their fried rice twice so they had every reason to be upset if you guy are out there i just wanna say thanks and you re the best edit we had two pot of rice and the first one wa from the first pot which wa definitely no good but we used the second pot which i thought wa better since it wa le gummy looking at the second remake it seemed fine but i guess i should ve actually tasted it with a spoon to make sure it wasn t like the first one so i guess i m partially to blame they also shared a glass and a half of wine a well a an appetizer i didn t include that in the story because it didn t seem relevant sorry about that total wa wine beef overpriced i know appetizer total approx after tax

this one happened the night before last occupancy for room a lot of our guest are here for professional conference and meeting right now not too many leisure traveler at am my alarm panel start going off the alarm panel is different from the ear shattering alarm that go through the entire hotel the panel is more of an annoying beep beep from the control cluster in the back office it give u time to investigate before emergency service are alerted and more importantly before the property wide alarm go off i knew that the alarm system had been acting funky so i dispatched my security guard to the site where it said that a pull station had been activated he came back on the radio saying false alarm the pull station lever wa still in position i attempted to clear the notification on the panel but the panel wasn t cooperating with me and i just knew that the alarm wa going to sound sure enough it went off but i wa able to silence it within a half second that one didn t raise any phone call although i m sure it woke up most of the guest since the light were all still flashing and making me very nervous i called the alarm company and asked for a tech to walk me through the step to make sure that the alarm did not sound again he walked me through and seemed to be very knowledgeable of my exact panel configuration he told me that he had been there just the day before so a he wa walking me through the step sure enough one of the button actually set off the alarm and froze the panel for second before i could silence it i told the tech that s exactly what i wa trying to avoid and he apologized profusely and told me to call his personal number if anything else happened at this point all of the panel light are back to normal but now the phone is ringing off the hook because at least people are now wide awake in the middle of the night and probably thinking that there might actually be an emergency out of all of the phone call no one wa throwing a tantrum of the call and people that came to the lobby were satisfied to hear that it wa a false alarm and then they went back to sleep only two guest actually had a gripe and even they were not nasty towards me they were understanding that it wa a situation outside of my control you better believe i took care of the night for them and more tl dr alarm went off in the middle of the night because of a glitch alarm went off a second time because i wa trying to fix the problem almost no complaint and the one that i did receive were very polite they got everything they wanted
this bitch ordered a dirty martini but it wasn t to her liking so i got her another one still wasn t to her taste so the bartender made another her friend look at another table and asks me what drink is that over there and i tell her what it is and if she d like to order one herself she say yes and i have the bartender make her the mix drink then after drinking it a little she claim that it ha coconut in it and that she s allergic to it i apologize even tho it wasn t my fault and go check the drink menu the drink she ordered doesn t have any coconut in it at all only one drink ha coconut in it and it wasn t hers so i go back and show them the menu to say that their drink shouldn t actually have coconut in it but they both wildly exclaim that they can definitely taste the coconut in it so i give up i ask my manager to take the drink off their tab which he doe next i come to give them their tab and to my surprise their drink cup is empty and there s a bunch of liquid on the ground she give me this attitude point at the ground say i spilled it and look away from me like she s the fucking queen of whateverthefuckland i dont say anything cuz i m shocked i ve been a server for year and whenever customer spill something they re almost always apologetic and slightly embarrassed but she wasn t and after i didn t say anything she point at the empty glass and say look you can see the coconut on the glass i m always nice to customer even when i shouldn t be my coworkers tell me all the time but since today wa my last day and she s the worst customer i ve ever gotten i straight up calmly asked her did you spell it on purpose then we start getting into it before my manager come over and tell me to go do something else but she s still yappin omfg i hated this bitch she spilled all her drink onto the floor next to a hot grill where me or the chef could slip next to plus how could she completely spill all the liquid out onto the floor and yes it s possible she just had a big accident with the drink she didn t want anymore but judging from her attitude when she told me she spilled it she definitely did it on purpose and wanted to give u a hard time thank god it is my last day

i had a regular a few year ago he would order a large coffee with half of a small creamer in it our creamer machine only did small med and large no half shot so you would have to put in a small shot then dump out half of it if the coffee wasn t exactly to his liking he would let you know not in the usual sorry i don t think this is right he would yell that is not half of a small cream and would refuse the coffee until you made it to his liking ugh i do not miss working there
having to explain to people why we can t price match an obscenely low rate from a rd party is so frustrating one time this lady wa like i saw rate online for like ok can i see them and when i asked to see it somehow they were looking at the wrong hotel but just had it or suddenly it wa showing hotel name in vermont not texas today this old couple asked for their reward account to be applied and i forewarned them that their point would not be applied but their night towards a status raise would he then said annoyingly and dramatically do you know what the rate in ota name offered wa cue my uninterested as what i don t understand why you guy can t offer me that like i don t know don t care and don t see why you re complaining you got a great rate but won t get point so you re mad also that rate wa offered most likely because they had a reward account thru said ota boomer irritate me
what are some of the crazier scam being in industry that you have witnessed one scam that ha stuck with me is below i have worked in the restaurant industry since i wa basically year i started to manager full time about year ago back when i served i had witnessed what i thought wa every scam out there obviously i wa very naive from when i started serving going into management because i realize the scammer only get more creative one that i will never forget i wa the foh manager and there wa a gm we were the only manager for the restaurant the gm wasn t the brightest guy the only reason he wa promoted wa due to the previous gm getting fired and the owner wanted to bring someone in on a lower salary from there i transferred to this location a the foh manager one afternoon the gm wa working and it wasn t very busy only a younger guy at the bar drinking this guy ha a tab when the guest wa ready to pay his tab he asked the bartender if she could run his card for the tab and add in a tip he said his bank atm wa too far away and he didn t want to drive that far the guest offered to give the bartender of the tip and she would give him so the bartender obviously wanted to make this happen for the tip the bartender went to the gm who wa on the office to explain the situation the gm without even giving it a second thought said ok so the bartender run tab my shift started at pm a soon a i walked in the door the bartender wa so excited and couldn t wait to tell me about the tip she explained the story and i just shook my head i looked at here and asked if she thought anything about this wa off she said no i asked her what kind of card did he use she said it looked like one of the pre paid amex card i then explain how we were scammed by this guy she asked how i explained that the guy probably only had enough to cover his tab with aloha the tip are usually added later and even if entered right away it won t process though until the end of the night when the restaurant batch all transaction this bartender wa young and new to the industry so i wasn t really upset with her she did the right thing by asking the gm the gm should have known it wa a scam or know that something wa just off the stupid thing about this wa after i explained to the gm why it wa a scam he still said i wa wrong i told him nothing about this make sense there are atm on every block some where the gm response wa that he had great instinct about people i told him that this time his instinct were wrong keep in mind that the gm wa the type of person that think they are right of the time when in reality it s more like the opposite and only right of the time i also told him we cannot give the bartender the other he argued that he wa the gm and once we swipe the card it ha to be approved that s when i explained the tip don t officially come out of an account until the end of the night just to prove my point i called amex on speaker next to the gm the only info i had wa the last four of cc guest name and transaction i gave this info to the rep explained what happened to the rep the rep couldn t give me too much information but i asked if she could answer just one question is there enough money in the account to cover the tip and she said no then she said there is barely enough to cover the tab even after this the gm tried to say it didn t matter it would over draft his account the rep jumped in saying actually it won t and it s likely none of the tab would be covered needle to say when we explained what happened to the owner of the restaurant he wa not happy the owner even asked me one on one if the gm wa that dumb

it is a truth universally acknowledged that every hotel ha or ha had at some point at least one mr x mr x is that regular guest whose dreaded call come when you least expect it at pm on a busy day with a nonchalant i ll be here around tonight which make the entire team sigh in unison oh no not mr x our mr x not only always reserved at the least minute and did not take no for an answer but he also haggled price like his life depended on it demanded free upgrade to a specific type of room and exhibited all around terrible behavior he would regularly go out a couple of hour before co time on the day of his departure and tell the fda he d call u to let u know if he extended or not leaving his thing in the room and of course we were supposed to hold the room until his majesty deigned to call i actually had his thing removed once because he hadn t called at pm and when he came back in the evening he threw a hissy fit because if he hadn t called to let u know he wa leaving that obviously meant he wa extending his stay he wa unpleasant to the housekeeping and breakfast staff wa pretty dirty wrapper on the floor of the room etc and generally pretended to be a nice person until someone disagreed with him or dared to be taking care of another guest while he had need to be attended to the indignity which is when he would flip his lid you know the type mr x had managed to extract a comp stay from our management because of an extremely shady lost piece of luggage complaint supposedly we d lost it while we were keeping it for him supposedly it wa very expensive branded luggage etc he then proceeded to not show up for the comp stay which meant we lost a room during high season then called one week later to get his comp stay at a new date saying the original date hadn t been confirmed and it wa our fault for misunderstanding him management gave him the second date comped a well now a you can imagine i d been dreaming about blacklisting mr x for age but no dice we re a small property and management ha a pretty loose policy on rate a long a you re inside budget upgrade comping breakfast etc which is good in some way since our fda have a lot of decision power we have a very competent front desk team but our worst regular know this and will try to take advantage of it every time mr x wa coming fairly regularly and giving management that sweet no commission piece of business in addition of how difficult it can be to actually blacklist someone until the joyous day of reckoning that is during his comp stay mr x wa staying in the same room with his ex wife and their toddler who they were having a custody battle about we found this out because mr x s other adult son came to fd in the evening to get a second room for the previous mr x just in case they had a fight which should have alerted u during the night all hell break loose and they start fighting screaming throwing thing at each other etc the na who ha plenty of experience and take shit from exactly no one call the police but they don t end up doing much except giving them a warning since it s a mutual domestic dispute and there is no actual injury the next day is a saturday which mean no management which mean i m in charge i m fom but since it s a small property and we re always understaffed i work a lot of fda shift i call our gm who tell me i finally get the pleasure of throwing him out guy ha done his usual shit gone out the room and told u to hold it until he confirmed he would extend so i call him on his mobile and tell him that we won t charge him for tax or extra and he can take a much time a he need but all of his thing need to be out of the property by the end of the day and he won t be staying with u again ensues screaming insult threat demand to speak to the gm a well a strong implication that he want to talk to a man i m a rude insignificant small fry and can t tell him what to do etc i say nope to all the above a politely a i can manage he end up coming back luckily considerably subdued and exit with family and belonging in tow fighting with his ex all the way to the door the comical afterword of this story is that he keep calling periodically over the following month asking for a room and get told every time that we re fully booked until the gm finally get him on the phone and tell him that the breakup is final and there s nothing he can do to get u back
a few year back i wa staying at one of my favorite hotel that i ve frequented enough to know some of the staff very well i also had a very high level guest status in their reward program a i wa doing a lot of travel and staying at one property or another almost every night for stretch up to several month at a time at very nice property well i get in one evening and get in line to check in and wave hello to my buddy bob working the front desk solo in front of me wa some grumpy guy moaning on and on about how he wanted a specific room and bob wa explaining that not only wa it not available they only had one room left and it wa a suite at a higher rate now bob is a nice guy and it wa late enough that he told the guy that he would give him the suite at the regular rate but apparently that wasn t good enough and he wa just ripping bob a new one about not having his preferred room free and asking if they had any late arrival who had the forethought to make a reservation bob could bump to the other room and bob explained that he couldn t do that well after seeing what bob wa going through i did what any hotel connisure with more point than i knew what to do with would do i whipped out my phone and booked the suite in their app in addition to the room i already had the guy finally relented after enough time had passed that he figured he wasnt going to do any better and got bob to give him a free breakfast and parking and wanted to take the suite bob go to get the room for him and take a look at his screen doe some typing and then just stop and look right at me for what seemed like an eternity i put on my biggest grin and gave him a little wave and watched him resist laughing so hard i thought he might stroke out after the horror show of telling the guy sorry they were now fully booked and all of the nonsense that ensued i waited for the guy to clear the lobby and we absolutely lost it i told bob to give the room away to someone compliment of my company a long a he got a cc from them took my key and went to bed chuckling about it a i fell asleep from then on everyone there heard that story and i went from elite status guest to legendary member of the family every subsequent stay i posted this a a reply to another post a long time ago and a few people asked me to make it a thread so here you go

alternate title the homeless are gonna run this place soon i just had some bike toting scroungy dude tell me he wa gonna sit in my lobby and wait for a guest couldn t give me a name or room number so i told him to leave he go outside but is still on property so i pocket the pepper spray and go tell him to leave he act all defiant and even step to me when i pull out the can so i hose the jerk he take a few aggressive step in my direction so i duck inside to grab the bat and hit him in the upper arm i can guarantee he doesn t even have a bruise this p o s ha the nerve to call the cop on me that s just funny though but the cop i understand their perspective i really do and i have nothing but love for of them i had to kick a belligerent cop out one night story for another time that said being told to just call the cop in these case and wait for them to come is so unrealistic they know a well a i do that for a regular trespass call the response time can go from forever to maybe never meanwhile this trash lord is mouthing off or causing a scene for however long they want sometimes even getting bored of doing whatever they please and wandering away still on property mind you just out of sight rd shift i don t leave the desk the icing on the cake though is when the say that if i feel threatened the best course of action is to run and hide lock myself in an office or room and just wait do nothing so let the homeless be dumpster fire until they threaten me then run away and give them free reign to be dumpster fire until the police eventually show up the frustration i feel right now honestly make me wait to both scream and type a ridiculous list of profanity but i m still at the desk and you guy don t need to be reading around my sailor shaming vocabulary it make me want to quit but besides the wave of unkempt trespassing crazy talking breakfast stealing halfwits this job is almost too easy
of all the thing that i could dislike about my job side work is the worst most specifically being a closer all of our side work is the closer responsibility not the manager the manager is only responsible for making the closer get everything tidied not the individual server responsibility that mean that if say three people don t do their back of house side work then youre stuck doing a much larger share of cleaning than anyone else and whats the penalty for not doing side work well you the individual closer could call anyone and ask them to come back in and do their side work they skipped but ha anyone been written up nope but ive seen back of house closer getting written up for not wanting to clean for those who just left honestly im having more problem with the employee and management at my job than the customer and thats not good
we do a lot of event at our hotel so we have a large and experienced event staff i work in the event side of the business and i work in one of the more client facing side position recently we had a fairly small event in one of our ballroom that wa expected to get smaller because of corona virus panic we already knew they were going to ask u to remove some table and chair and we just needed to ask how many to remove but the main client hadn t come in yet a soon a she came in she walked around the room and started complaining about everything i couldn t even get an introduction in before the complaint started she finally circle around to the back of the room and asks where my manager is i am already dressed better than a manager would be but she assumes since i am younger i am not one i don t even want to deal with this at this point so i call over the manager and a he is walking over she tell me everything thats wrong i tell her oh you don t need a manger i can have all that done for you she ignores me but just to be proactive i call over a houseman to get it done i explain it to him in front of her she ignores me manger get in she explains it all to the manager he go to tell the houseman and halfway through she cut him off and start explaining it like he hasn t already heard it time the houseman get it done in about minute and we were hoping that would give her some confidence to just let her deal with the staff in the room a opposed to calling a manager every time nope they ended up having to assign a manager to the room a she refused to even speak to anyone else she would complain and tell u all her problem but then insist on speaking to the manager about it at this point we all just avoided her making all her request take twice a long because she had to call the manger personally to have him explain her request in person half the thing she asked for could have been done by the staff already in the room the other stuff just required one of them to have someone come take thing away or bring thing at the end of the event she wa happy at least so we can say we did our job but jfc if she wasn t annoying
i ve made a post here before and i ve got several more story to add this is by far one of my favorite in my last post i mentioned working at a well known seafood restaurant well prior to that i worked at their sister restaurant but this one wa italian we had a bartender i ll refer to a brenda sometimes brenda will pick up serving shift to make extra cash well on this one particular lunch shift brenda had a two top in which only one of the two woman would speak to her when the other woman wa ordering she would look at her friend and say tell our server that i want blah blah blah brenda isn t shy so she say i m right here you can just tell me lady looking at her friend tell our server that i don t look at people who serve me they re beneath me brenda just rolled her eye and wa like fuck this she didn t have any fuck to get into it with this lady turn and burn the lady never looked at brenda or spoke to her directly the entire time brenda took it all in stride and didn t let it affect the rest of her day but she didn t forget that woman her face wa burned into brenda s mind a few week had passed and brenda came to me with a story of poetic justice apparently while on her lunch break brenda had visited a department store at the mall just up the street from the restaurant and guess who she ran into the lady who wa too good to look at brenda wa an employee there hanging up cloth without hesitation brenda walked up to the lady and said hi remember me no you wouldn t because you don t look at people when they re serving you well i m a year old in medical school who work to pay her tuition you on the other hand are a middle aged woman hanging up cloth for a living she then grab a many cloth a she can and throw them on the floor and say have fun picking those up but i won t be looking at you a you do because i don t look at people who pick up cloth off the floor she walk away i asked her what the lady s facial expression wa but brenda said she didn t bother to turn around and look she got her justice and kept walking i really really really want to believe that brenda s action kicked that lady into being more respectful to others edit forgot to add that about of employment in my hometown is blue collar so for anyone to be uppity to another person is just stupid we were all on the same playing field so not surprising to find that woman working retail and we have a decent amount of people in our city but not enough to be lost in it meaning that it s still small enough to run into the same person more than once

so i m working the front desk afom at the start of a huge city wide annual athletic event this event brings in more than visitor to the city we are fully booked and there ha been a constant stream of arrival all day our hotel had about of it s room blocked off for team and the rest were general public we had around room note the athlete are all adult in their s s this isn t a kid tournament a gentleman arrives at the fd and say he need to check in his team who are on their bus and will be arriving shortly i spent a good minute trying to find reservation under any of the name he listed or the team but came up with nothing i head back to sale and after about minute of research we find that this team doe not have any room at the hotel they had made contact after the previous year s event the sale department gave them a quote and faxed over a contract but the team never sent the contract back so the room were never blocked for them in fact the sale associate who worked with them left shortly thereafter so there wa no attempt to contact the team when they didn t send the contract back they also never sent u a rooming list they were expecting room for a week and we were already oversold and praying some guest didn t show up because there wa no where to walk them to within a mile radius the sale manager and agm get involved together we explain to the gentleman that his team doesn t have room and why this guy completely lost his shit in the lobby which wa full of people he get escorted to the door by several employee however he yell that he s not done with u his entire team is going to be arriving at any minute and they will be back for jason he named the sale manager which isn t really jason but that s what i ll call him jason wa terrified he thought he wa about to get his as kicked by an entire sport team we couldn t see a way of blocking all of them from entering without causing an even bigger scene there were guest everywhere a constant stream of people going in and out the front and we just didn t have the staff for this kind of confrontation the only way to jason s office is by walking down the hallway adjacent to the fd but the entire front wall of his office is glass even the door there wa nowhere to hide the bus pull up we know it s them because the team name logo is all over it i run back to jason s office to lock the door and jason begs me to stay inside his office with him because he know the glass door is flimsy a shit and he s afraid they are just going to bust through the glass he think my presence will stop them from getting violent i wa very obviously pregnant like month pregnant so i stood in the middle of his office between the glass door and his desk an entire line of huge dude storm down the hallway and stop in front of the glass wall one guy try the door i wa just standing there staring at them through the glass with my hand resting on my swollen belly and jason sitting at his desk behind me basically trying to sink into the floor and disappear they ask me to open the door ummm nope they start screaming through the glass and i start cry because i m nervous and terrified some of the guy walked away in disgust but a few of them continued yelling for a couple more minute then they called him a fucking coward for hiding behind a pregnant woman stormed out yelling obscenity through the lobby got in their bus and left and that my fellow front desk friend is how i used my baby bump to save the sale manager from getting his as beat it probably wasn t the best of choice had i more time to think about it i would have never stayed but it worked and all turned out fine well fine for u at least i don t know what happened to the team or where they ended up amp x b edit to add we considered calling the cop but we didn t know if he wa actually going to come back with the team people say crazy shit when they re angry and we didn t want a bunch of police in the lobby making a bigger scene or the bad press we d get if we had an entire team arrested we would have called if they actually got violent but they just did a lot of yelling and then left

so this my friend is a story of a time of a busy lunch i had in my restaurant there are no host just server trying to greet everyone but we get busy we don t always spot people at the door bartender get too busy to greet too and manager a well we re part of a hotel so we re always busy doing something cross related so most of the time it s sort of understood you can grab a table and wait for a server people are pretty understanding i wa busy this one lunch grabbing a coffee for someone and when i came out i saw two new lady at my table imagine two middle aged lady with suit on they were attempting to order with the busser who had a very confused look on his face our busser s english aren t great and they are not comfortable with order i jumped in and waved him away with a smile and he looked relieved lady one is brunette with short hair a little quiet but sporting a frown like she had been paralyzed that way lady two is a bit younger with blonde hair and flaunt a sickeningly evil smile i can smell something bad already me hello there lady so sorry i wa helping another guest but i can help you now he s not a server so unfortunately isn t trained to take your order can i take it again lady one no turn her head away me uh haha um if you don t mind just giving me a rehash so i can put it in real quick lady one head is still turned away from me lady two we already gave it to him and we re in a hurry and make sure my salad doesn t have dressing me which salad is that lady two you can ask him what we ordered me miss i need to take your order myself if you just don t mind telling me they both stare at me just stare and i m done with it so i just smile and go okay i speed walk to my manager through the weed of our restaurant jungle i find her and explain what happened she is a little topsy turvy stressed from her duty she go okay and head to them i see her talking and she walk back to me i ask her what s up what did she say manager oh they re fine they said they re just waiting on food me noooooo i explain what happened again in more detail me and then they refused to confirm their order with me they re not waiting an order because no one put it in manager oh oh my manager seems to wake up she rush over to them and next thing i know i see the lady angrily getting up to leave my manager throw me the thumb up sign and i walk behind them to make sure they leave lady number two is walking by the table and loudly saying what a disgrace this establishment is what a embarrassment i wave goodbye and cheerfully smile at them me bless your heart lady have a great day outside today it wa pouring rain outside that s it that s the story just simple sweet justice a lot of the time with certain manager you ll see a different outcome you worry that the customer will end up being right even when they re wrong i think it happens more often than not especially if your job is kind of shitty but it didn t happen that day and that s a win
so ok being at this a long a i have i m no stranger to property being bought and sold all the time a one of my previous owner described it the hotel is always for sale if someone is willing to pay the price i can respect that however our property went up for sale a few month ago we were really close to a closing date so the manager called a meeting and told everyone what wa going on the deal fell through at the last minute so while we are no longer listed we are still technically for sale anyway saturday night at the pm shift change this guest stomp up to the desk flipping her shit that her room wa not cleaned me and the girl are going through the standard response oh wa your dnd up blah blah blah i retreat to the office to pull the housekeeping list for the day and this woman is just carrying on about how we re just making excuse and how low class and trashy this all is and how she know we re for sale but this is just an unacceptable way to run a business she make a point to tell u that not only wa her dnd not up but they intentionally left it on the floor sticking halfway out of the door for u to know that it wasn t up really so a dnd that look like it fell off your door handle is not supposed to look like a dnd but whatever our sign and door handle do not agree with each other very well if you turn the knob with the sign on it s pretty much gonna be on the floor it s a design flaw that we are not in the position to do anything about we have the brand required sign and door handle i don t think too much about the her comment we apologize offer her fresh towel and toiletry and to take care of her trash but tell her the room wa marked by the inspector a a dnd she start up again at how unprofessional we are and how dare we expect her to sleep in an unmade bed she bitch for a few more minute and go back to her room in the morning i m talking to the executive housekeeper and the morning desk associate and tell the ehk about the for sale comment she know a we all know that we re for sale but we both find it odd that this chick so readily know a i m giving my breakdown of event to the morning desk clerk i tell her about this room being pissed they didn t get service she proceeds to tell me about her check in experience with these folk the husband start off telling her he know we re for sale and tell her the listing price then of course he try to pry information out of her number of employee longevity of those employee and then of course revenue information she tell him she s just a desk clerk and told him he would need to talk to the realtor or owner he keep trying and keep talking about the asking price i go back and mention it to the ehk because wtf we are both very intrigued about this but decide to just pas it along to the manager so she can talk to the owner if you ve never managed a hotel that s been up for sale or managed throughout the sale there are a few thing interesting about this most hotel sale listing do not include the sale price those are available with revenue report through the broker after nda is signed no one with any business purchasing experience is going to flippantly tell an employee of that business that they are up for sale let alone tell them the price they booked rd party every potential buyer that ha stayed with u in the past few month ha a reservation set up through the owner a a comp and every one of them knew not to discus business with the desk clerk i had a couple last week that were asking about local industry and commerce which is of course fine i m happy to answer those question but these folk were straight up asking about revenue and shit that the staff is not going to just tell people we googled the shit out of these people and found that they have an llc on the west coast a well a an llc on the east coast that is listed a being an apartment company the wife is natively a local but they both live on the west coast now and seem to be in town for the holiday after my googlefu i m hoping that they don t actually have the mean to purchase the property because of course to buy a branded property you have to be able to not only qualify for the loan but also prove to the brand that you have the capital to take on the required pip if you intend to remain in the brand i m really really hoping these folk don t have that available honest to god there are not word to describe the level of douchebag coming off of these people they re just dripping with it i know of employee that will walk if these dildo do manage to somehow buy the property me the desk clerk that had to interact with them and the ehk i ve never done it outside of daily report but i m super tempted to email the owner about these folk amp x b a an update i wrote an email but at the end it sounded like the ramblings of a madman so it s sitting in my draft folder when i walked into the office this evening though there is a note on my manager desk with these folk contact info asking for it to be passed onto the owner a they are interested in making an offer guess i should start job hunting just in case

i worked on a cruise ship for one contract and it wa the best and worst experience of my life traveling the world for free wa incredible but the guest are the reason i won t do it again i did three week of training on a ship out of miami and then my permanent ship wa in australia longest hour flight ever i wa told that australian were nice like canadian maybe the one i met were just aholes my favorite story is this one i worked at guest service otherwise known a the complaint desk i think we were doing a day cruise in the south pacific and embarkation day is always the worst there wa always a line halfway across the lobby which is huge complaining over the tiniest thing we were a couple hour out of the port when a couple come to the desk mg mean guest me me obvi mg i want to get off this boat me i m sorry sir is everything okay mg no it s not i want to get off me we will not arrive to our first port for day sir is there anything i can do to help mg everything suck and i want my money back i don t really remember what he wa so angry about but he stormed off after a few minute of yelling at me but wait it get better so on board every department is connected with an online application that track guest issue mainly complaint we re supposed to check for new post at the start of every shift and i see one from the dining room they wrote that a man and his wife came in for dinner were seated by the hostess but didn t like that table so the man got up and wandered around the dining room before sitting down at another table the maitre d came over to them with a dining card after they were seated and said that they could have that table for the whole cruise if they wanted but apparently that wasn t good enough the man then got up stormed to the front of the dining room threw the card at the hostess and left his poor wife still sitting at the table of course it wa mg a few day go by and i read another report this time from security i don t know all the detail from their report but basically mg got in a confrontation with some security guard and didn t feel safe because they were surrounding him mg refused to leave his room until the end of the cruise and wanted all his meal from the dining room delivered to him it doesn t work that way but that part isn t crucial to the story fast forward to the last day of the cruise they never left and i see an email of a scanned letter that wa given to our manager it wa along the line of i apologize for my behavior towards the staff it take me a long time to feel comfortable being away from home but my favorite line wa i take most then scratched that out all of the blame for the incident with security we all got a good laugh from the letter and then we wondered did his wife force him to write it sorry for the long post i just wanted to share that

they ask for pepperoncinis i don t know why but they do it s a given the second is when they ask for four side of wing sauce for their pizza gotta have that variety the third is when they run you around even when their drink is completely filled they don t need a pizza box right when the food come out just ask me for an atrocious amount of ranch the fourth is when they butter you up with oh you were sooo sweet you were so good you were absolutely so amazing buttering me up doesn t pay my bill janice
let me start off by saying that i really do enjoy my job this is my rd hotel and it is by far the most organized and positive environment i ve worked in so far but today i got an email from my gm that rubbed me the wrong way my hotel is currently still in the slow season post holiday new year so despite my front desk still getting hour there hasn t been much to do especially during the weekday when it s mostly business traveler we have trouble finding busy work after there are no check in no phone call no guest request nothing to straighten clean stock etc a the fom i can sometimes do back end paperwork stuff to occupy time but recently my front desk agent have taken to playing solitaire seriously just straight up microsoft built into the computer solitaire not even online competitive stuff since the computer block online game just plain old solitaire it s so basic that we ve even joked about how we re all going to be giving our grandparent a run for their money with our skillz and honestly i didn t think anything of it because jesus christ it s solitaire it s not like they re all on youtube or their phone or something but today my gm who is strictly one of those m f office chair gm sent me a nasty email detailing how he caught the am shift girl playing card on her computer after check out time i really don t even know what to say to him personally i think it s cruel to expect people to stand at a desk for hr and stare at a wall it s not like my agent have been soooo wrapped up in fine tuning their future solitaire career that they ve been ignoring guest or shirking on their duty it s literally just something they ve picked up to pas the day during down time for the most part i m happy with my front desk staff and don t see the point in reprimanding them for trying to keep their mind from melting due to boredom end of rant

ok so i m at a casino hotel so when i say general manager i mean for the entirety not just hotel manager but gosh i love it when people say i know gm name i play golf with him you should probably comp my room or something stupid along those line because i know him too si and he s probably played golf with every damn person in this town you are not special lol and he rarely give comp to people if at all so idk but i love when people think that knowing someone higher up if they actually do most of the time people just lie about it is gonna get them anything when of the time it s really not gonna do anything
just happened a lady come down i had to deal with a few kid so i assume it s their mother or another relative so i wait for her to ask for something i ve told to different group of child we don t have instead she asked do you have a match or lighter i m confused but shake my head and say no i don t smoke and if i did it would probably be a vape because i don t mess with traditional cancer stick only high tech one jk jk she look at me in disbelief you don t have match or a lighter i shake my head and she roll her eye and take a seat on the couch it kind of irritates me because i m being scolded for not enabling her in shortening her life if i did have a lighter it d be one of those zippo lighter with a personal engraving on it which i sure a hell wouldn t let it out of my sight at work anyways just a few minute ago i find her asleep i wake her up and confirm she doe have a room but she isn t in a good mood perhaps a fight i decided to give her minute far more than enough time for her to get her emotion in a line also because i know i m not going anywhere for a solid hour so i could keep an eye on her if she decides to stay awake then that s fine but she just can t sleep i gotta talk to her in minute though hopefully i ll be alone for the rest of the night after her i have talked to her she say that she will stay awake but didn t move much i didn t have time to wait though a i need to help a guest with their tv
this is a long one hello fellow fda i m here with another tale from my room independently owned sunshine inn this is a tale from last work week and encapsulates the worst night of the hotel life i have ever experienced last saturday i wa working shift we have had some long term stay guest that have been rather problematic for our staff refusing hsk berating staff sneaking pet into the room and general bad behavior their house apparently burned down and red cross is paying for their stay they will be identified a shitty guest and and have two room in our property s smoking section they were staying across the hall from a man who had checked in for just a few day who will be identified a meth guy meth guy had been problematic for different reason he checked in claiming to be a good friend of the family that owns the hotel but wa somehow unaware the family wa out of the country and had been for three month despite this he felt it wa necessary to remind u of his friendship with the family literally every time he interacted with staff he had a penchant for wandering the property shirtless and shoeless and walked into our lobby with a lit cigarette multiple time this guest also called the front desk five or six time asking u to call him a cab and wa informed each time that all cab company in the city were out of business at some point last saturday shitty guest and got into some sort of feud with meth guy i tried to be uninvolved with this a i wasnt inclined to trust either party on the matter shitty guest called me complaining that meth guy wa harassing them i wrote this off until meth guy entered my lobby to inform me that shitty guest dont belong here and he told them to leave i told meth guy to mind his own business and hoped that would be the end of it oh how wrong i wa shitty guest and meth guy got into a battle of calling in noise complaint on each other they went back and forth a few time and i wa preparing to evict all party involved when i received a call from shitty guest saying that meth guy had exited his room naked and wa running around the hotel in the nude this greatly concerned me and i immediately locked the lobby to go search for this guy i went to his room first and nobody wa inside so i changed the lock i then spent minute combing the property for meth guy with no success i returned to the lobby knowing meth guy would eventually go there for key a i locked his room when i returned i had two guest that were angrily waiting for me wanting a refund one guest informed me that a man matching the description of meth guy had attempted to forcibly enter her room five separate time during the night she wa refunded and left without much more fuss the second alleged that meth guy had pulled a knife on him and had attempted to rob him he did not request a refund and returned to his room i called the police at this point which i hate to do because i m the only employee on the property and it s hard to deal with police on the premise and conduct the hotel business at the same time the police arrive and begin to search the property it is at this point that the night auditor arrived early for her shift which i wa tremendously thankful for i asked her to go speak to the police near the back building while she wa doing that meth guy entered the lobby requesting new key fully clothed thankfully i wa able to stall him in the lobby long enough to covertly text my night auditor and have her bring the cop to the lobby after about twenty minute of arguing with the police meth guy wa arrested and his wife wa also removed from the property swearing the whole time that the owning family had betrayed him by having him arrested i ended up staying late at work that night giving a statement to police it wa an incredibly stressful night shitty guest ended up staying over the next night despite my note to not extend them so i suppose in the battle of the methed up sex offender and the family of shitty guest the family win this round
so had a panic attack today fun stuff new year s eve and day are always the worst in any hotel i ve ever worked in we have been getting lot of demand and request from guest and also lot of complaint over every little thing sometimes people lie to get compensation which is always a joy but no for some reason all that wa happening since i came in today at pm and yet this is the one that got me for some reason so my coworker did not check in this particular guest because our specific policy say that the person name who is on the reservation is the only person that can check in a room for security reason she explains to this guest family that their name were not on the reservation and therefore could not check them in they were pretty calm and said they understood and they left their bag with u to hold so they can kill time and get something to eat while the main person who wa paying for all the room would come in they said she would be here in probably min depending on what time her plane land main guest call the desk and start the conversation with why i can t check them in and before i can even answer her she cut me off and tell me that she can give me her id and card info over the phone and that she ha three room and she stay all the time and she threatens me with leaving a bad review for each room ok lady like fuck all the way off and at this point i still have not said a word and she immediately asks for a manager and when i told her that it wa just me and my coworker she questioned my level of authority and asked if my coworker wa higher then me to which i replied no she then just rip into me and because i kept getting interrupted and not being allowed to explain anything i completely shut down my heart wa racing my hand were shaking and i couldn t breath so i put the phone down and walked to the back and sat down just trying to breathe and freaking out mind you i m human so i get annoyed with guest and thing sometimes but i m usually pretty calm but i don t know why but this triggered a panic attack and i haven t had one in the longest time so it kinda freaked me out my coworker ended up talking to her and taking no shit from her and said she could speak to a a manger tomorrow and that we were not going to call a manager and make an exception to this rule it s just been an awful holiday a far a work and i m ready for this people to just leave good start to the year y all
this is gonna be short because otherwise i m going to go on a whole tangent basically the kitchen wa batshit crazy amp order were taking way too long for absolutely no reason one of the woman at work got upset and started work place drama i finally completed my training and got bored despite how unrealistically busy it wa today they only let me have one table at a time for some reason so i have a group of four young woman i do my greets i serve them well they say they want lot of our little candy i wa honestly glad because candy they re leaving all separate check which is a bitch to deal with but i got it gave them their candy they really tossed the wrapper all over the damned table a i wa cleaning up no le i really don t understand the point of this what wa the point lmao wrapper don t leave your damn wrapper on my table lady please just hand them to me or at least ball them up also i only had one table and it wa kind of annoying because i got bored despite literally helping the other like server and running food etc i wa bored and only made because they only gave me one today when i wa supposed to have two but anyways that s all doe this happen to you guy a lot
honestly the not even my clientele i am grateful to work in several job in the south where my clientele treat me with respect a a trans woman but i hate being told i m cut throat and i m only out for myself people being envious because i am making money and they aren t but they want me to feel bad because they don t have money yet they spend half their time sitting at the host stand i m a black trans woman in the south no other server ha to walk up to the table and hope they are properly gendered because someone can have an issue with trans people and they can take it out in my tip no other server ha to worry they are being treated differently because their employment doesn t want to offend no other server ha been bullied by another employee and reported it several time and instead of feeling protected they are feeling they are a part of the problem nexus because he dislike trans and make it known no other employee walk into work realizing they are different and fearing today is the day they will be let go it just make me uncomfortable and piss me off that anyone who claim to care about me and claim to have a good heart doesn t realize in a world that hate people like me i have to be guarded and i have to hustle because i have missed job for being trans they can walk in and get a job many job won t hire me because i am trans and that s why i m still here making in hour because i know my pool is smaller than theirs
howdy and haylo my fellow shift monkey tonight i bring you a tale of woe and cowardice to make your spine shutter and my knee weak so sit down gentle reader and avail yourself of my tale two night ago standing at my spot in the lobby mostly surfing reddit mostly trying to appear busy and professional probably failing one or the other only the fate can decide that regardless a i stand there i spy a fuzzy little dude hop out from behind our coffee machine and run straight to our rear lobby door once he arrives he begin jumping up and down a though trying to trigger the door somewhat surprised i tried to trigger the door with a broom so he would run out not happening he bolt off somewhere and the chase is on i lose him under some furniture but i won t be defeated this is my turf fleabag and i know you haven t paid your room and board bear in mind i had no desire to kill him merely move him outside so he can return to his normally scheduled ratly duty so picture me running back and forth through the lobby at roughly in the morning chasing a rat with a broom yes very mid s i know my favorite moment wa when a random lyft driver stopped in to use the bathroom and found me sweeping up nothing i m sure he noticed the huge pile of nothing but chose to continue on to his relief i lost him again at this point though i suspect he had taken refuge under our lobby phone booth it is just for show imagine an all wood booth like you d see again in the s nothing to do at this point but wait i can t leave anything out to try to control his path since the lobby is about to start kicking i just have to hope like hell he either stay hidden or come out again before am hit he did this time he run right to the front lobby entrance and again start hopping up and down i had lucked out a this door isn t a giant po and the control for it is right next to my pc i open the door and the little guy scurry away into the night to do whatever the hell it is rat do when not running about in my lobby after the firework i peek behind the coffee area to discover a roughly inch diameter hole in the wall complete with rat droppings under it i write up a small note for my boss to have orkin come earlier than usual and finish out the night i purposefully did not tell my relief a he is a notorious gossip fast forward to tonight we have instruction to be on the look out for any potential area they could be but assurance that the trap are all re baited ingres and egress point have been sprayed etc etc et al cool bean on with the show do a few property walk run the audit typical night now come the cowardice listen i am not a large guy by any mean but i am also not afraid of jack and or shit having worked my fair share of notells people just do not frighten me well minus mike tyson for obvious reason getting back on point i had just finished a property walk and wa settling in for the next hour or so before the next i stupidly set the flashlight that i carry on a little cubby that wa just slightly too short for it to fit into so i have to sort of wedge it between the shelf and the bottom of the counter it hang perfectly or so i thought about an hour after this i am standing in front of said cubby putting together key packet it is at this time that my haphazardly hung flashlight give up the ghost and fall out of the corner of my eye i just see movement and hear what can only be described a scurrying y all i jumped roughly foot straight up i wish i could say i wa exaggerating but i can t i ve even rewatched the tape and i m fairly certain my foot were just shy of the top of the counter by about inch on the way up though well i full force kneed the marble countertop i dropped instantly and curled up in an assball and tried my damndest to stifle the string of expletive flooding my mind my only saving grace during this the fact that the audio wasn t set to record and my boss don t get to hear me shriek like a year old at a flashlight god my knee hurt only and a half hour to go
it s just about am here on the west coast and while i ve already had my saturday night share of confused looking food delivery driver searching for an address that doesn t exist thank you guest who just drop location pin instead of typing in the name of the hotel you re staying at here in the middle of this hotel district i ve also just had an unusual one a young man wearing a nice shirt and tie knocked on my locked lobby door we lock the lobby door when there s only one person on site but since we re not quite a hotel and in a very quiet neighbourhood i don t generally see much traffic after hour a it is i opened up and asked how i could help him he held up a magazine specifically a watchtower magazine he told me he s heading around the neighbourhood to talk to night worker and i thought that wa a pretty clever idea even though i told him we couldn t accept any unauthorised material to display in our lobby and that it s just not something i m interested in myself he very politely wished me a friendly good night and headed off toward the hotel next door i hope he find some other night worker who is down to get the jw talk otherwise i m sure it ll be a looong night for him i gotta say in the five year i ve been doing this job i have never had a missionary come to talk to me after midnight at my job anyone else ever have some unusual nighttime visitor
i m invited to a friend birthday to a newish restaurant it s been open about month tacqureia type place caters to the something crowd she call a a week ahead say a party of about will be there everyone show up within min of when she said it so happens it s a saturday and one of the dating apps are having a meet up so the place is pretty slammed we get our table seated drink order are taken the server is being shadowed by a trainee i don t think anyone expects lighting fast service in this scenario at least most of u didn t long story short drink slowly come out then eventually a couple order come out then nothing etiquette eventually wa overcome by hunger and those with food began eating the server and the kitchen were obviously having a bad night and the server didn t have his system down because a lot of the order were just wrong and ticket were going to the wrong table but that s not the point of this story the point of this story is when faced with adversity how well do you handle it while other s are not unfortunately one of guest in our party failed miserably we ll call her lisa lisa s food along with others didn t come out it likely didn t get put in or went to another table but instead of having a polite conversation asking about what s happening she proceeds to resort to passive aggressive insult about every time the server pass by or an employee is within earshot the speed of service is critiqued how simple it is to make a taco how she s not tipping this guy repeated threat of yelping best way to win over the staff of any business lisa eventually get her food and of course it s not good enough and the server again is riddled with passive aggressive insult enough to the point where other guest are annoyed with her behavior they begin to lay into her she is now obligated to start defending herself for her shitty behavior to the server credit he comped the meal but lisa had to get the last word in with some smarta comment despite his effort lisa successfully managed ruin her meal and other s in the process a feat i haven t experienced in quite sometime i don t really condone the behavior but it wouldn t have hurt mine or probably anyone else s feeling if someone back of house did something to her food

a snowy morning in my small mountain town and a quiet night audit for a weekend with several large tour in house but it s never that easy is it our pool is closed from to since there s only one person on during graveyard but last night our pm shift gave a guest the ok to one of our guest to use the pool room to exercise at am while her family wa asleep of course when one person is in the pool room after hour that mean other guest decide that they can use it at any hour too and at our town resident sex worker wanders into the lobby having clearly just come out of the hot tub to grab some coffee she wa just wearing an oversized button up shirt but it wa long enough i didn t feel right saying anything until her guest came into the lobby a few minute later wearing just his swim trunk old man hairy chest bared to the fluorescent lighting of the lobby he asks her for his shirt back she undoes the button i prepare myself for her chest to be out i prepare myself to ask her to put the shirt back on i silently thank the god she s wearing a bikini underneath it never that easy in the worst timing for a wardrobe malfunction taking off the shirt cause the shoulder tie to come undone a family walk into the lobby to check out and her chest is bared to them luckily the guy wa at least semi classy and covered her back in the shirt and the family wa understanding but holy shit le tit now

year ago in the s i did a short stint at a theme roomed hotel attached to the at that time world s largest shopping mall we had themed room type the truck room had a chevy with bed in the back traffic light and road sign all over there wa a roman room with a round bed and statue making up the decor there were a couple other type a well the room themselves were quite small but commanded top dollar and wa a destination hotel plus it wa built in to a million square foo shopping mall water park amusement park a you might imagine it wa very busy on long weekend and special occasion christmas wa an exceptionally busy time but like most hotel business dropped off in the new year so when february th approached the hotel pulled out all the stop in advertising for the big occasion this year the th wa a friday and the monday a statutory holiday so they were packaging it a a night stay with romantic dinner breakfast in bed rose petal in the bathtub etc etc the hotel and the shopping mall were simply smothered in advertising hawking the romantic weekend the ownership group that owned both the shopping mall and the hotel were known to be notoriously cheap they had given the entire print campaign to a new untried company that offered a steep discount the print campaign included banner flyer poster insert tent card etc etc when the material arrived in early january the banquet department wa tasked with distributing all of the content a battalion of pilipino lady slathered all public space with poster you couldn t swing a dead cat in that hotel without hitting a poster i wa the shift fo the evening after the poster went up and i wa in an elevator going to do my room inspection all fo manager had to inspect room a week and submit maintenance request and housekeeping report i wa alone in a guest elevator and glanced over at the promotion poster it looked odd but then the door opened and i stepped into the hallway in the hallway wa another poster and i examined it at length something wasn t right but couldn t put my finger on it i wa sitting in the back office when it hit me i went out to the desk and looked at a poster we had behind the agent valentine s wa misspelled vanlentine s with an extra n there were pallet stacked with box and box of the various print material and on every product every instance of valentine wa spelled vanlentine i think that when you look at the sign printed in big red letter with heart and cupid shooting bow and arrow your brain just automatically recognizes the word without you actually reading it that is why it took me a while to figure out the spelling error i took down all of the material that were on display around the front desk i sent an email to the director of sale pointing out the error the next day i wa on my two day off and i assumed it would be handled by my return when i got to the hotel after my day off i wa surprised to see the same sign up outside of the staff door but i assumed they just forgot to take that one down so i peeled it off the wall and brought it inside with me i wa very surprised upon getting into the hotel that all of the sign still containing the miss spell term we re still up everywhere when i checked my work email i did not have that email at home in those day a email wa very new i had a message from the do telling me they were just going to run with it it would be too costly to re create everything and they didn t think it could be done in time someone somewhere along the line had signed off on the proof that were sent to them by the printing company so when they initially contacted the printing company to tell them about the error the company said tough shit you approved the proof english wa not the first language of the printing company owner really it wa like more his fifth or sixth language i personally thought it wa a joke for a hotel of this calibre to continue to use that material but ultimately we only received about half a dozen report over the entire time the content wa up
i have been a night shift worker for year now it started with getting to my mind making me feel lonely not being part of all the activity because i have to work not being part of all the general group that work in the day and not being able to talk to a lot of guest now i have started to feel the effect on my body my lung are not working optimal i don t smoke and i am generally not sleeping well anymore sometimes hour before a shift i have asked to have a few le night shift and a few more day shift to be more a part of the staff and to talk to more guest they basically didn t do anything about it even though i showed them what i could do by making a system in the store room and routine for the kitchen staff i also wrote in my report about the few small but good experience the guest had of me since we have a question in the report for just that i started becoming so tired that my posture became very slanted and i started to feel a pain in my arm which according to my physical therapist came from my neck i had a sick leave for a week and then a few week later the pain got worse i powered through but then i just said that i couldnt come in to work for a few day then i got a mail from the gm it basically read i really hope you re not going to go on sick leave again it s very hard for other people to work your night shift your job is not that tough anyway so you can just keep your arm calm during your shift and since then they decided to hire extra people to work if either of u working night got sick allright i thought now they got extra people who could probably take some of my shift so i could take some day shift nope some day shift got available in the beginning of the fall and i asked if i could work them and get a few le night but they told me they couldn t do that they didn t give me a reason i now have some trouble with my lung undiagnosed my arm ha gotten better but not perfect and now they put up a new question in the night shift report that asked how we were doing on our shift i wrote that i didn t do well after a few day my bos asked why i told him that i couldn t sleep well that the improvement i did didn t matter to people and that i still felt lonely he basically said yeah same a bit over a month later i got so tired that i fell asleep while walking then the gm sent me a mail and said that it wasn t cheerful enough to write that i didn t have a good shift she also sat me down in the morning and told me to think more positive keep in mind that i have arranged party and activity for the employee no one else ha done that and countless other stuff that i have changed for the better at the hotel tangible thing that i can point to i could do a lot more but when i ask the management for help they don t do anything and wait for me to do it but sure i am the bad guy good thing that i got receipt between me and the gm and other management at the hotel of how they have treated me but now i am stuck in a job that i have to do until my health give in or go down in pay because i have to go for another job that ha le hour and pay le sorry for the long post even though i tried to keep it to the essential update just found out i might have a good reason to report them to the authority for this

my background i worked a a server host bartender key holder for different chain corporate restaurant over the spam of year or so i ve been completely out of the industry for about year now recently i ve started taking a new medication that give me weird dream but an overwhelming number of them are nightmare about being in the weed with my table showing up to work and my section is already full etc even before this medication i had these type of dream every month or so so they re not completely out of the blue tl dr people who have been out of food service for a while do the dream eventually stop
i work at a sport bar a a server i love it so far and i think i m good at it this is my first time ever having a serving position i work really hard and don t mind doing extra side work and staying late i worked on sunday for a lunch shift a nice family came in and i still had about minute left a well a about other table finishing up so i took this table they let me know they didn t plan on ordering until halftime i had gotten them drink and an appetizer and then told my manager they were going to wait quite a while he said it would be fine if i transferred them to someone else i let them know and said i would be sure to tell the other server about the food allergy they had mentioned for a little boy at i reminded my manager that they weren t going to order and that i wanted to transfer the table he said it s only can you just wait until or or bro i didn t ask again and i ended up serving them when they did finally order they were my only table for over an hour because the new server had come in and taken my section i wa very frustrated by the whole thing not because of the customer but because of my manager i felt that he had disregard for my time and it wa entirely unnecessary since the new server had come in i made in an hour i also felt awkward because i had already told them they would be getting someone new i tried really hard to not let it show that i wa ready to leave i wanted to give them good service and not try to rush them or anything it wa just overall very frustrating i m a very mild mannered and non confrontational person but if this happens again i think i might have to press the issue more because i don t think that wa fair of him to do
me hi there how can i help you today customer i want one of these hand me coupon me i m sorry but these coupon expired last year we don t have any coupon out right now customer not missing a beat so are you going to honor them
so a the title suggests yesterday my town university had a home game along with a large scale basketball tourney for kid and some speech convention for high schoolers needle to say we were packed we had call ahead large group a and another all at noon we open at so we set aside space for them assuming anyone who got there around wouldn t be gone by y know normal restaurant stuff so around or before ish some guy and his wife walk in and ask if were open i wa hosting that day and opened i just accepted it and said something along the line of not yet but i can get you seated anyway because i had a server there already and she wa bored so i took them to the server section and they rejected the spot and requested something in the middle of where we were saving i told them i would double check what all this server had so i could get them a close to what they wanted and they just walked their happy as over and sat down right in the middle of our reserved section now our manager is also pissed at this but is all about being nice to customer so she didn t make them move i then walk back over and bring their menu and stuff to the new table and the get very upset a to why our tv aren t on they ll come on around when we open to which they say thing like oh around will they come on or what and a bunch of whiney patronizing stuff anyways i go back to the host stand and no joke within the next hour and a half we get walk in s a and about walk in gt s along with the large call aheads now we are not a large restaurant and obviously can t get these people all in at once not to mention who just show up with people without calling so the other host and i along with the gm spent our day frantically trying to menouver these group to get table despite the fact we couldn t pull thing together because the tv couple wa literally just hanging out in the middle of our movable table with no sign of leaving any time soon to top it all off almost every group wa rude about the wait and rather than stay towards the waiting area they crowded the entire restaurant and got in everyone s way their kid were just running around treating the place like a damn playground a well moral is sit where the host tell you to sit or at least ask to move if you have above what we can sit with one table call ahead please control your child in a public place
so i saw a post on here that reminded me of this story i m on mobile so apologize for my format we had a guest come in and my service partner got sat the table a woman came in by herself i greeted the table a to help out my co worker the lady wa nice but spoke very softly hard to pick up what she said i had gone through my whole greeting and sale pitch that is when she told me she used to work here but didnt understand our membership card which gave me some red flag however she got her drink and free bread from me to await taking her order from her server she ate her free bread and drank her drink then she just left without ordering both me and the other server were scared and sad that we may have messed up we are both new to this location and never saw this lady before that is when another server and manager explained that the lady is homeless and pull this trick i wa relieved but didnt know how to feel about it she needed the food and cool air in the hot weather of texas so i just thought hey she needed it and i m okay with this i wish i could help her more but couldnt the server wa relieved but like me unable to know how to feel about this she took up her section and the server needed the money worse than me so i gave up a table to let the server make up what she lost in the time how would yall feel about this situation i mean i cannot be upset or angry but same time she lost money a she lost her slot in the seating order due to that if i didnt give her one of my table it would have lost her some real good money for the night i have no kid the server ha so in the comment explain how you would feel or handle the situation i would love to hear from others thanks for listening to my story i hope the lady is okay
i ve bartended for two year been serving for almost six currently serving at the super popular italian chain wink wink i ve been there three and a half year i ve been the number one server there for the majority of my duration this is a fact not arguable i ve never had a guest complaint my score are astronomical comparatively i get a dumb amount of guest that compliment me to manager or email the company i have so many yelp review that yelp ha started removing some because people don t even mention the restaurant they just rave about me i don t mean to sound like my ego is over inflated but i m the shit that being said i have outgrown it i go to work every day super comfortable nothing can happen during a day that i can t handle i m complacent soft and squishy i feel bad about myself because i should be pushing for better thing especially since this is my career i don t want to move up to bartending or management there but i m young and i love the hustle and the benefit are great so what s the move keep a few day a week there and find a new spot more and get a job there that s exactly what i did i scouted out a bunch of finer dining place in my area turned down a couple of offer found the place i really wanted to work crushed the interview and got offered the job now i have crippling anxiety lol i dealt with it in the past but i haven t had it this bad in year i have been having server nightmare i can t get to sleep i m stressed because this is a whole step up it s actual food the head chef is the owner of the place he got back from china month ago and ha a featured part of the menu inspired by his trip it s rotating everything is fresh there s shit on the menu i don t know how to pronounce all these new wine to learn i feel like i m drowning even though i know i m not saving people life it s just food on the table i need some word of encouragement from my server family
i don t know if we are allowed to talk bad about server here and if we are not let me know and i ll remove it so i don t eat at fancy restaurant a lot over nope however i had just gotten a big paycheck and i wa with friend so we decided to go to a fancy restaurant we were sat and the waitress came and immediately asked if we would like chip and salsa i thought it wa like when olive garden give you bread stick so i said yes she left and came back with the chip and salsa waited til we started eating and then she left and came back with the menu turn out that you had to pay for the chip and salsa i wa a bit miffed but let it go she then decided to get our drink order and i asked how much a malibu sunrise would cost she said she didn t know because she didn t drink alcohol i asked if she could find out and she said yes i asked for a sweet tea she came back with our drink but forgot to ask about the malibu sunrise we ordered and soon got our food she rarely checked on u talking with her friend by the bar wa more important she finally came to drop off the check i asked for a to go box she said she would get it instead she went to the bar said goodbye to everyone put on her jacket and walked out the door we had to ask busser for a to go box i don t know if that wa normal for her but it definitely stood out for me
and she got close to my face and said what did you say trying to intimidate me out of saying what i wa going to say and i smiled at her really big put on my best customer service voice and proudly said maam i said and i hope god give you some patience because we are all trying our best here and i am very sorry to hear you had a bad experience but please dont be so rude a we are all trying our best here and she wa so surprised i responded all she had to say is well your best is pathetic and then she left and i wa so mad at her for threatening the host who btw had nothing to do with her horrible service because she is the host and not a server i started cry also who tf scream at a year old and a and lecture them about god and hell and their soul because your food took longer than you wanted it to like wtf and before anyone say anything trust me i know i did not react the right way i am a very nonconfrontational person i have never ever in my entire life ever argued with a customer and i am always so polite but the combination of using her religion to threaten and demean two teenager pushed me over the edge i wa so shook by me responding because i never do and i felt bad i cried for like half an hour also im only at my first serving job if it matter but ive been working there for about eight month now
i work in a restaurant that us the bare minimum staff we recently got a new gm and she ha decided to double or triple the labor used in the am so now the night shift is a skeleton crew by that i mean that we have cook dishwasher busser server shift lead and host only fri sat sun from before she took over we had a host wed sun from close pm so they could help with all the closing cleaning at night i m the main night closer so i worked wed sun from pm to close i have a bad back but closing by myself for the last month screwed me up so bad that i couldn t even get out of bed my back feel like someone took a hammer to it when i m still but it s even worse when i bend or twist ha anyone used worker s comp and how doe it work i messaged my bos about it and she s making it seem like i need to file for disability and they re not responsible i know for a fact that all the sweeping mopping vacuuming cleaning the boh and re setting it and also all the large tray are what caused this thank you for any advice

i work sorry worked at a casual upscale restaurant in british columbia i wa there for a year i mention bc because employee get great support from the provincial employment standard act esa an employee must be written up three time before there can be a serious threat of termination the write up ha to be co signed for it to count in december for example i showed up to work minute late it wa completely unlike me and after the shift i signed a write up no problem it wa my only documented transgression while working there i feel like now is the right time to tell you guy that wa not kind to me i wa attacked and robbed mid year court case ongoing and have been attending two kind of therapy for my ptsd and my beloved mother passed near the end of the year from terminal cancer her diagnosis came about a month after i wa attacked i tell you this for context not for sympathy nobody at my work even remotely knew about what i wa going through i kept everything completely compartmentalized what i m trying to say is my professionalism wa not affected anyway with the arrival of management decided to really tighten the rein they were cracking down on everything with all that going on my gm and i decided i should take january off mom s birthday would have been mid january upon my return i wa inexplicably held to an extremely intensive standard turn out giving me that time off put the restaurant through a little strain ok not my fault i wa told it wa totally fine and even preferable for me to take the vacation my first monday back wa the first snow day in vancouver where transit wa actually running i arrived at work minute late but wa the second person in the building after the bartender my first and second day back i performed well enough to get decent tip but management could tell i wa stressed so they put me on probation a conversation for which there wa no record and no co signage furthermore according to the esa i mentioned earlier you can t just randomly put an employee with only one write up on probation at the end of the meeting my gm said see you saturday because that wa my usual schedule monday tuesday saturday unfortunately a new manager had been hired in to do scheduling and gave me shift outside my availability which i missed a head office manager call me on friday and when he realizes i didn t know i wa scheduled again outside my usual schedule he say don t worry about it my friend if your bos need you she ll call you in here s where shit go down gm call i say i wa called off by an ho manager she hang up on me i figure out a ride to work and text her that i can be there in she tell me no just come in for a meeting tomorrow tomorrow come and i tell her i am having severe anxiety and wish she would call or text so i understood what i wa walking into in order to help manage my anxiety and i get this text your final paycheck is in the mail no severance no explanation no legal justification and apparently no severance pay i ask to be contacted so the term of my firing can be properly explained to me one of the top dog a man we ll call kevin call me a few day later he say you are an employee not our emotional responsibility we don t care if you signed the warning if the gm say she spoke to you and there s no record it still go on your file if we terminate another employee for missing shift time in month that ha nothing to do with you because that s our discretion speaking about it is actually a breach of the other person s employee confidentiality look i m sorry your mom died and you were assaulted etc but that s not our problem take a look in the mirror and take responsibility for your trauma our only duty to you is to pay you if you show a you can tell kevin is lovely i ve filed with the government and will be demanding severance for wrongful termination i ll keep you guy updated edit i realized i forgot to address kevin s statement about my coworker missing shift and the unclear wording of that portion of my tale allow me to explain my coworker missed shift in month with the weak excuse my dog is sick she wa given pas after pas after pas until they finally started writing her up for her inability to show up to work day before i wa put on probation this other girl wa finally fired the esa say that employee must be held to the same standard obviously this is so that everyone understands the term of employment and what behaviour are acceptable and which one are ground for termination the fact that she wa allowed to completely just not show up for work time and not be terminated is a completely different standard than the one i wa held to when kevin mentioned this in his statement to mesh used the excuse employee confidentiality a a way to cover his as for inconsistent and unfair treatment of employee sorry that i didn t include this originally i hope this clarifies thing if anyone is interested find information on bc s esa here http www gov bc ca gov content employment business

for context i work at a small room property where we only have one desk attendant on shift at a time a such we do solid hour shift and don t get actual break we take break to eat when we have the chance it s currently in the middle of our slow season right now and there is very very little to deal with during my shift so i can take a break to eat pretty much whenever i want i wa taking a moment to eat some dinner when an older woman came in through the lobby door she just walked straight through into the hotel and i had no reason to think anything of it a few minute later she come back in through the front door again this time she still walk straight through but give me this weird glaring kind of look a she doe it should be noted that anytime anyone come through the lobby i am always standing ready to greet and assist them unless occupied with another guest of course or so minute go buy and this time she come back through the lobby again but from the inside of the hotel going out the front door once again giving me a strange glare a she doe so but not stopping or saying anything to me this happens two more time until the last time she stop in the middle of the lobby and just stare at me i ask her if i can assist her with anything and she say i can smell food and i can tell that you ve been eating internally i m thinking ok and i tell her yes i have been taking a break for dinner she tell me that i am not allowed to eat while i am on the job and that she is going to report me i tell her that is not true and a we do not get break we are perfectly allowed to consume food whenever we like she snap back with saying don t lie to me i ll be having a word with your manager and wanders off about minute or so later i get a call from the woman from her room where she state i can smell your food in my room and you need to stop eating now this is getting really strange and ridiculous this woman is literally on the other end of the hotel and there is quite frankly no possible way that she can smell my food outside of the lobby let alone somehow across the hotel in her room i m right out done with this woman and her ridiculousness at this point and tell her that quite plainly there is no way that she could be able to smell my food from her room and she can speak with the owner in the morning who will confirm to her that i am permitted to eat while on shift she yelling at this point say this whole hotel smell like food because of you and it s ruining my stay if you don t fix this problem i will be contacting your corporation and filing a formal complaint i had long been done eating my very much not at all fragrant turkey sandwich at this point and decided to wander down to where her room wa to see if there were any offending smell wafting about down there i get to the end of the hall where her room is at and it doe in fact smell like food down that way it smell like someone in a room near by had microwaved some delicious lasagna or something i call back to her room and tell that i have investigated the problem and that it appears that another guest of the hotel ha prepared some food and apologized for the inconvenience but that anyone is allowed to eat food here and there is nothing i can do about the fact that she can smell it she snap back at me saying this is a hotel not a restaurant why would people be eating here this should not be allowed and i am still reporting you yes whatever lady you do you a little while later i get a call from a woman saying that her mother is staying at our hotel and that she had just called her very upset saying that she felt unsafe because there were noxious fume inside the hotel and that her mother had said she tried to report the problem to the front desk but that no one wa at the front desk because they were too busy eating and were ignoring everything and asked me if i wa aware of the problem and if she needed to contact authority because of it at this i could not help but let out a laugh i explain to the daughter of this woman who she had called to complain for her now that the noxious fume were someone microwaving food in a room near by and there wa certainly no hazardous substance or any threat to anyone s health at the hotel and that i have personally spoken with her mother a number of time over the last hour her response surprised me a i wa prepared for more ridiculousness she just said oh it sound like she is in one of her mood sorry about that i ll take care of it and i haven t heard from the old woman since what is wrong with people like this it s like they are a classic stereotype of an old miserable person that just want to make other people miserable in any way they can and manifest problem for them to complain about i look forward to seeing if she report me in the morning

i work second shift pm at a hotel chain the offer a complementary breakfast after breakfast is cleared most of the food get put up in the back kitchen the exception to this is the cereal dispenser which remains on the counter with a cover over the handle which usually work a a deterant from people helping themselves usually last night about a couple of teen came down off the elevator and go to sit in the dining room this is fairly common teen traveling with family who don t want to hang out in the room go wandering for a quiet place to hang out no big deal until i hear the cereal dispenser i can t seen it from the front desk but it is a distinctive sound i loudly say from the desk the cereal is for breakfast only i hear another bowl getting filled i then walk around the desk and look into the breakfast area the two teen are sitting there conveniently avoiding my glance i notice that the cover ha been placed back on the dispenser i started to repeat my statement when the phone rang i figured that they each got their bowl i had told them to stop everything should be okay right i walk back to the desk and take the phone call and continue my duty ten minute later i hear the cereal again i quickly pop up the desk manager will be back directly sign grab the cordless phone and walk into the breakfast area i look at both of them still trying to avoid my gaze and very loudly say guy the cereal is here for breakfast only the girl say oh okay the boy on the other hand decides that he is in the mood to argue well if it s free at breakfast why can t we get some now i had been trying to be nice because i didn t want to be that uptight bitch but i wa annoyed now yes the cereal is free for breakfast i pointed to the sign on the wall that state the hour for breakfast a you can see breakfast is over the cereal is one of the option that we provide it is free for breakfast not for when ever you feel like coming down and getting it i turned away from them grabbed the cereal dispenser it s not super heavy just kind of bulky and carry it into the back kitchen i then make a huge show of locking the back kitchen area i put on my fake at customer service voice and say you guy have a great evening
first of if this sound kinda weird it s because the conversation wasn t in english and i don t know if i got the totally right translation for everything so i work in the service area of a theater there are a couple of story i could tell but this particular one happened just a couple day ago and wa really weird i never had this in the year and a half i m working here yesterday i wa at one of the bar right next to each other we have sort of booth where each of u ha their own set amount of drink snack and their own till i wa at the very end of the bar right next to the door of the auditorium shortly before the break started a man sauntered out of the auditorium went to my booth slapped the counter and demanded an employee beer at first i didn t even get what he wanted and said that we only have normal beer he insisted on an employee beer after looking at him more closely my inner alarm went off and i asked for an id that confirmed he worked with our company for context we do have special price for employee usually about half of what guest pay but you usually recognize employee if they are part of the cast and crew of the production we are hosting they usually wear a badge that tell u they are cast and crew other people we recognize by their uniform and colleague we recognize by face because we work directly with them not only did this man not tick any of those box he also reeked of alcohol back to the story after i asked him for his id he told me he didn t need to show one because after all he helped build the stage set when i doubled down because i didn t know him and needed to see that id he got condescending proceeded to mock search his pocket all the while saying he didn t need to show me and to just sell me that beer i didn t back down and the discussion ended with him wanting to speak my bos my shift supervisor wa just a couple meter away because she wa waiting for the door to open so she could turn the music back on she had followed the whole conversation and immediately announced her presence the man went to her and started the same discussion with her she only told him the same thing that i did he even mentioned working for a company i never heard of before and got further angry when she told him that this wasn t the correct company at that moment the door opened and a lot of people came into our area the man sort of waved her off angrily and vanished into the crowd later i heard that he told another coworker at the same bar just two booth down the same thing and he got away with it because the coworker wa new and didn t think anything weird about it he just asked another coworker which price employee pay and off that man went the nerve it wasn t a huge financial loss and i get that our normal price are quite high but still i also feel bad because i thought for a second that i should warn the others at my bar about him but then i got overrun by customer and forgot
hi i d like to book a room for friday and saturday night i m sorry we are currently totally booked for saturday night but i do have some availability on friday i really need saturday night a well if i can t get saturday i might a well keep driving a couple hour to another hotel and get the second night there i ve stayed at your hotel many time before are you sure you can t just squeeze me in oh you ve stayed with u before well why didn t you just say that silly sure let me pull one of my extra special super secret room out of my asshole so you can stay on saturday
the bar is one large half circle bartender b hey wheres your section my bartender b i m right here doesn t even make eye contact with her coworker lazily motion to half of the bar b okay cool i m this other half and we are today the middle is ours to share b not even looking her coworker in the eye only focused on the po screen yea i m here too this is all mine motion to the middle of the bar technically if the bar wa split directly in half fairly i m seated in b s section but b is the one taking care of me b well yes but we re sharing you gotta remember to share b still not looking her coworker in the eye to me that s huge disrespect at this point yes i m in the middle thank you very much b okay then she seems shy and like she s trying to avoid a verbal altercation here in front of guest i m honestly struggling with how to tip b after witnessing this restaurant work is a team effort a a server i understand tipping but i would also never speak to my teammate that way i m technically not even in her section so i literally want to tip to cover tip out if any after listening to this thought
so this happened around early september i m a busboy at a sea food restaurant a town away from my town we get up to hour wait over the summer into late december it get crazy especially when the band play which is every night and people start dancing so i m not sure if other restaurant use tray for bussing i ve only seen them used in fine dining place which is what we re considered except we seems right below that title if you ask me because of how hectic it get anyways i m clearing plate stacking tray and bring them to the kitchen this is constant until closing and then some if we still have table it s around pm when this elderly couple call me over while i m cleaning a table and i m thinking cool they re gonna want some extra tartar sauce but the wife surprise me with complementing my work ethic i wa having a shitty night and this sparked a flame in my heart the husband continues off his wife and also compliment me while referring to my name tag which is also a nice boost i thank them and get back to work after an hour or so it look like the couple finishing up they call me over again and the husband slide me a i ve never received a side tip higher than so i wa shocked i tried to hand it back but he insisted i went mock the rest of the night week later i m clearing off this top when this lady surprisingly say my name i shift my gaze to see the couple from before and of course treat them like good friend i greet them and shake the husband hand a few minute later i walk passed the husband and he slip me another and at this point i m like what the actual freak i firstly accepted it this time and he told me how he appreciates a job well done i thanked him before i got back to work just a story i thought i d share since it wa such an anomaly to me
alright so figured this belonged here so i came into work literally jut now and i go into the bathroom poopoo time and i see that the toilet ha been totally moved to a new spot epic i work at a japanese steakhouse and the bathroom is connected to the bar and i had to clean it up myself i ll explain better someone had gone edit ok i guess i type terribly my bad i ll explain better someone had gone into the bathroom picked the toilet off of the hole it cover and then moved it to a whole new spot sorry for any confusion
i have had multiple guest over the year i have worked in hotel ask for thing so many homeless people or just those down on their luck looking for a free room or a free cab ride to the other side of town people ask for free phone charger that other guest may have left behind free laundry service and other random commodity all for free today a potential guest walk up to the desk he reek like cigarette and ha a nasty sickly sounding cough being pregnant and not wanting to catch his germ i kinda scooted away to talk with him at a distance he wanted our cheapest room available i tell him that i will need to see a credit card and id he ha id but no cc so i tell him that there is another hotel on the other side of town who will accept cash a payment but it s the only one in the whole city that will do it he want me to make an exception i tell him no meanwhile he s open mouth coughing over the whole desk and reeking up the place while i have other people coming in to be checked in i tell him there s nothing i can do for him and i have guest to help he start pulling everything out of his pocket and putting in on the germ ridden counter maybe he ha a secret credit card it s a bunch of paper and envelope and cigarette after i check in the other guest this guy asks me for the phone number to the hotel i mentioned i write it down and give it to him he call tell him his name and phone number and walk off he come back and asks if there is someone who can give him a ride i tell him that i can call him a cab but it may be awhile because i just called a cab for an actual guest and they estimated a minute wait we are in a relatively smaller city no uber or lyft or anything like that he is irritated and asks how he is supposed to get over there how the fuck did you get here to begin with dude i remind him that i can call a cab he asks if i m gonna pay for it uhhh no it will be le than five buck if you can t afford that you can t afford a hotel room that is gonna ask you to put down a deposit so in come the guest that i called the cab for which ha also been an issue during his stay but that s another story he asks this guy for a ride and he say that he doesn t have a car and is taking a cab the guy asks if he can take his cab i really don t know what wa going on with this guy he seemed out of it but not on drug just generally out of touch with how society function amp x b edit for spelling error
so a if to balance out the bad i already had this sweet older gentleman came into the lobby and informed me of a truck backed into the parking lot asked if i had known about it i didn t and he explained that it had been there when he had come back about minute before i came on shift at least people light off drinking beer looked shady from how he described it i told him i d investigate this guy already informing me of a potential safety issue went even further and insisted i call him if anything happened it wa so sweet i just have a soft place in my heart for guest that actually give a shit about my safety but anyways i go to investigate out of one of the side door facing that part of the parking lot and lo and behold it wa there backed in beige light off at the time i didn t know the color so i called the man to confirm it this guy declares that he s going to check it out for himself he come back and tell me it s empty so crisis averted we joke and he go back to his room but that really did make up for the other guy having an attitude with me from the get go so to that guest who went above and beyond what you needed to do thank you you gave me a good smile i ll miss guest like that once i leave this place
so our hotel ha a restaurant that is inaccessible through the lobby working am shift i get the question where is breakfast served at least once for every checkout i have that day my response is always the same our breakfast is served at our full service restaurant restaurant name here located out of our front door and to the right and the response is always the same so we have to go out the front door yes and to the right so we have to go outside yes and to the right in order to enter our restaurant can we go out that side door if you d like but that lead to the alley way not the restaurant so we have to go outside yes and to the right i ve inquired ton of time with management about getting sign on the front door located across from the elevator that say something like your breakfast awaits just through these door or something like that which can direct people but they say it s tacky i don t think it s any more tacky than having the same exact interaction time per morning

so i quit serving a few month back and just decided to stick with my day job i couldn t handle the two job and being the hardest working server at this red robin i just gave up on the industry and felt pretty damn good about leaving their ass amp nbsp anyways i ve been going out to eat now and every time we go out my girlfriend like to mention that we were both server and we are happy that we left the restaurant industry amp nbsp now i get she is just being happy and lighthearted but i don t like it when she say that to working server omg when i wa serving i hated hearing people talk about how they used to be a server and they were so glad they left amp nbsp do any of y all enjoy those type of encounter i am genuinely curious to know the sentiment here so i can give my girl some feedback
this is a big rambly dump of a single shift i had it s a bit long but i wonder if any other bar worker have had similar experience week ago i had the worst shift i ve had in my professional career i work at a bar that turn into a club and a we re open the latest in the area we close at am am we get incredibly busy to start one of my manager called in sick so i had to start my shift hour earlier this involved working a few hour of our food service and the very first customer i served argued with me for minute because her favourite meal wasn t on the menu and then because her son didn t like any of the drink available with his meal deal and then finally because she thought it wa too expensive and then in fabulous customer tradition complained that her food wa too cold but her son s food burned his mouth our team leader gave her free dessert and she ordered all of them for just her and her son and expected them all free and doggy bagged to go roll forward a few hour i go to change a barrel and the top explodes and cover me in beer my bos wouldn t let me go home to wash or change so i look and smell like i m just fallen into a swamp when a coworker come in at the start of their shift they complain to the team leader about it who basically tell her to deal with it a it start to get busier into the night pm this family come in they ask for moet we don t have moet i apologise and suggest our fanciest prosecco or white wine they scoff and tell me specifically to get some class for even suggesting anything other than champagne they order about drink and change their mind about of them after i ve poured and served them they refuse to pay they call my team leader over and tell him i ve messed their entire order up my tl say that s not a problem tell me what you want and i ll get it for you no no they wouldn t want to waste product they ll just take these drink for free thankfully my tl stand up for me and say whatever they drink they have to pay for around am the other local bar close and about people flood into our person bar we re serving a quick a we can impressively so everyone s partying it s starting to become a better night and then come an asshole let s call him slurry douchebag so drunk he can t even order his next drink i say if he can say it he can have it but if not i m not serving him any alcohol he suddenly find his voice and tell me he s gonna punch me out and start trying to climb the bar i radio a doorman and he s immediately thrown out not even minute later another guy reach across the bar and pull my hair to get me to serve him next everyone on the bar and even those waiting to be served were absolutely shook we refuse to serve him he later come up after last call apologises hand me tip and asks for his drink now i tell him we ve stopped serving but appreciate the apology he rip the pound coin from my hand and tell me i m useless and to top it all off i got put on solo rebottling duty basically carrying all the stock up from the cellar to restock the bar which is honestly a more effective weight workout than any class i ve taken in the gym and then my taxi took minute to arrive so i didn t get home til am and i had a shift at am the same morning it took all my self control and responsibility to not quit the next day
backstory the first hotel i worked at wa located on the beach a i had worked in the hotel industry for over year i have many entitled people encounter thankfully i have left the industry and enjoy not dealing with traveler who think they can demand everything and pay nothing for it they treat you like dirt while being paid close to minimum wage this story happened in the early s so way before internet booking and advanced computer system our computer terminal took minute for the computer to get you logged in this is not a joke it took that long and once you logged in you never logged out that station wa yours for the duration of your shift our hotel computer system wa so bad we had to pre block all room for the incoming guest to know how many room we truly had leftover cast jg jerk guest me op bos front desk manager story our hotel wa sold out one night and there were several people trying to see if they could get their reservation extended for another night jg come down and say i wanted to extend his stay one more night i explain we are currently sold out but we can put him on a waiting list for any room that might open jg said well what if i choose not to leave are you going to kick me out i replied no but if you stay your rate tonight will be this much it wa about three time what he wa currently paying he smiled and said no i get government rate because i am a government employee i said with a smile while you are a government employee we do not have to offer government rate a you didn t have a reservation for tonight he did not like this answer and said you cannot do that my reply sir do you think we will extend your government rate if we have to put someone up in another location while you pay of the price it would cost u to put another person up because you would not leave the hotel management will never allow that to happen a we would definitely lose money he wa shocked i said that too him and said fine put me on your list i turn around and see my bos standing behind me with an aggravated look on his face i tell him sorry i know i wa full of crap and i just made that up on the spot my bos replied with an evil grin no you didn t that is exactly what we are doing and now that you warned him i can do exactly that and thank you the guest decided to leave and get a room somewhere else
so i wa working in the restaurant tonight a a favour because the restaurant manager wa near exhausted our kitchen is open for food between pm and pm on a friday night and we do our best to make sure all guest are aware of this to avoid any issue it s i m polishing glass and tidying up ready to close and move upstairs when this group of three come in asking for food i politely apologise and say our kitchen closed at and then went on to suggest a couple of nearby restaurant that my still be serving food to which they kept interrupting me and local place that deliver to the hotel i start to take their drink order and one lady say to me but we re resident of the hotel are you sure you re not serving food and i again politely explain no we re not serving food at all after pm our chef have both gone home at this point and i m not qualified to cook safely so i can t even make for them a sandwich it s worth considering friday we have a local business group that come in to the restaurant and have an early breakfast meeting our breakfast chef came in at to prepare for it and he wa doing a split tonight so he left at and wa back in for so a bad a i felt for karen being in a meeting and not being able to have the chance to eat my sympathy lie more with the chef who ha done split shift for the past three day in a row
we currently only have one working elevator in a room hotel and sold out it s been day the elevator company did a shotty job fixing something so we re waiting for them to return to fix it again this ha been a disaster even though we still have a working one wait time are kind of long people will come to yell at the front desk about it expecting u to just magically make it work and it s on my last nerve here s an interaction i had with someone guest so only one elevator work me yes unfortunately the cut me off guest laugh and say in a condescending tone so what you just only feel like having one running you clearly don t care about your guest s time he wouldn t let me try to explain that we re doing all we can but it s out of our hand he just walked away then when he come back from dinner maybe hour had passed he look at the one elevator still out of order and condescendingly laugh again this time saying un fucking believable you re really going to just stare at this broken elevator all night absolutely insane he expects u to he able to perform a miracle just because we re a business i don t understand how people can t understand that we have to go through rd party company just like they do which we don t have control over
i ve worked with two such gentleman max i worked at this italian restaurant for literally night and quit immediately why my first night i m getting to know my coworkers and hanging out while it s slow and she tell me that we have to take shift to to watch our supervisor max i thought it wa really weird but when max went outside for a smoke i wa told that the iphone we had up on a shelf near the counter we were at an establishment where you paid at the counter and we brought your food to you wa to have it camera left on and not be moved to watch max at the register because he regularly stole tip and cash from the drawer it wa known by all my coworkers and the kitchen staff and it wa known by management but he must have known someone higher up or something because he still had a job if that wasn t weird enough he always seemed very tense very shifty one day he came back in and reeked of plastic it wa a weird synthetic scent i d never smelled it before in person but i immediately knew it wa meth based on description my so had given me his brother used to be an addict this dude wa a meth addict who regularly stole from our register and regularly took smoke break to smoke meth even smelling him made me feel sick and i asked the same co worker if that s what he wa doing and she confirmed that for me he even went outside one day to greet someone in a black van and talked with him outside for a good while a dealer maybe idk but that wa more than enough to make me quit i wasn t getting paid enough to keep a drug addict from stealing all of our tip every night like i legit couldn t go to the bathroom if it wa just me and max at the register donald far le serious than max but i worked at a cracker barrel and this guy donald came off a this super sweet old man goofy made dad grandpa joke wa super friendly etc but then a coworker pulled me aside during my first week and told me to watch myself around him but more importantly to watch my tip i knew she wa right when most of the staff left work with in tip one night but somehow donald had made around he claimed that he wa just a favorite by customer but i knew better over time that cutesy old man demeanor dropped away because if you even stood near his tip for too long he d get kinda nasty like he wa super protective of his own tip because he knew full well what he wa doing to everyone else s i am super glad i don t serve anymore don t miss that stuff one bit
two middle aged woman came in to eat yesterday it wa valentine s day so obviously it wa a little busy but all my table had been so nice up until this point and i wa in a great mood i took their drink order and they seemed super nice at first once it get to taking the food order one of the lady keep pointing at one meal while calling it something else so to be extra sure i explain to her that the picture is of something else a catfish plate come with extra shrimp and what she s asking for is with no shrimp and just regular fish she say that s fine she want the cheaper plate so i bring it out and she start talking to me like i m a child saying that i know this isn t what she asked for i tried to explain that that wa the plate i showed her on the menu so she asks to see the menu i bring it over and she literally prof my point and continues to just be an asshole so i say i ll just go have them make the order it take a while so i go to ask if i can get them anything while they re waiting she cut me off and go you know you could ve just had them add the shrimp in the most rude tone at this point i could feel myself getting red and i didn t feel like explaining it wa different fish so i just asked again if she needed anything and she scream yelled no i went to the bathroom to cry because i knew my other table could tell what wa going on tried to recollect myself brought out her new food she complains about it again then try to grab my hand and say it isn t my fault i guess she finally felt bad i just took my hand away asked another server if they would take the table for me ended up taking that coworker to dinner and let her keep the tip i wa walking around all red and obviously teary eyed it wa so embarrassing and then one lady that i wasn t serving stopped me and gave me a little note i thanked her and wished her a happy valentine s day got home and there wa inside
is it true that host have to set the table after the busboy clean up the dirty table i work alone on my shift and it get overwhelming when i had to rush around the restaurant to set the table right after the customer leave so that the table becomes available for the next group especially when there s a waitlist forming behind me and the phone keep ringing i always felt like that s a too much work for a hostess we have only hostess working a hour shift on sunday but then i saw people posting here that their job have to make sure the bathroom is clean and at least i didn t have to do that
this past year my mom wa diagnosed with multiple myeloma a blood bone cancer where long period of remission are possible but that always eventually come back during a slower weeknight shift bartending serving my coworker and friend quietly checked in with me about how she wa doing and what shift he could help cover over the upcoming month i d have to be taking off to travel across the country and help her through a stem cell transplant unbeknownst to either of u a nearby table of regular overheard our conversation the rest of my interaction with them went a usual with me applying our friend of the restaurant discount exchanging pleasantry and my coworker and me cheerily waving them goodbye a they left after busing the table my coworker walked over handed me the check and said this is yours and don t you dare put it in the cup we pool tip and keep the cash in a cup by the register the regular had left me on a gas card that one of them must ve happened to have on them i d mentioned earlier that i d be driving to my mom for logistical reason and a note wishing me and my mom well and you got this i promptly went to the walk in to cry my eye out and feel my faith in humanity restored edit thank you for all the support and kindness and the silver y all it s been a hell of a year and to everybody also dealing with watching a loved one get hit with this top shelf asshole of a cancer i m with you and sending all the love
tonight ha been an annoying night partially because it s been busy and partially because i m itching to get drink with my dad after work anyway my shift is winding to a close and the rumble in my tummy that only hand fish and chip and cider can satisfy is getting louder when in walk a a member of the city police at first i assume he s looking for my coworker a i happen to know this cop and know that he and my coworker are bros but he s not today it s all business he want to see the camera after he make a quick and wonderfully overdramatic check of the lobby to make sure there are no guest he tell me there s a gorram stolen car in the parking lot cue flashback in walk a guy who look familiar hm doe he look familiar just because he s stayed before or because he s on the dnr he pass over his id and i do in fact recognize his name he used to stay with u all the time and he wa always a fucking tool about one thing or another often time we will ban people for that but apparently he managed to keep himself from being that much of a tool because his name wasn t on the dnr probably because he and my bos liked to talk motorcycle even though my bos didn t like him a a person speaking of i notice outside instead of his usual motorcycle a metallic orange dodge charger flashback end the cop describes the stolen car to me it s the metallic orange dodge charger what a fucking coincidence further coincidence the guy prefers first floor but got put on the second because we re so busy not just any second floor room but one with a camera literally right outside of it it also happens to be the camera with the best view of the parking lot i pull up that camera right a i do dude s girlfriend come out and the cop charge off guess who s on the dnr now motherfucker
i served a family of the other day and they ended up being at the restaurant for hour finally i give them the bill and they pay up they thank me and said it wa great a they re leaving i hear one of the woman on the table ask if he left a tip he say yeah of course a he s scurrying out the door i go over nothing on the table they paid in cash so it s not even like it wa a card tip he straight up lied to make himself look good bad enough that he didn t tip in the first place but jeez what an utter cretin

this happened a couple month back i actually heard this story from my manager our restaurant ha wood chair they re sturdy and old we had a guest come in she wa one of couple seated at this table in my section i guess when she got up to go to the bathroom her nylon snagged on the chair most pantyhose wearing woman know that snag are an unfortunate reality of wearing pantyhose you can snag them on basically anything it s annoying absolutely but definitely not uncommon anyway this woman go storming up to my manager going on and on about how we had ruined her whole evening because her nylon got snagged and she had just purchased them that day and she wa demanding to be compensated my manager asked for the cost of the nylon and then went and got exactly from the petty cash and gave it to this customer who smugly went back to her table for the rest of the evening and tipped le than on a bill we all laughed about it later over a shared bottle of staff wine you must have some serious stuff going on in your life to make that big of a fuss over a pair of nylon
i recently started working a a bartender food and drink runner at a mid range italian restaurant on saturday we were slammed the entire evening there wa barely enough time to restock our drink fridge and after having worked for almost hour i wa ready to leave after cleaning everything up but two six top decided to stay for a full on hour after our advertised closing time one of my task a bartender is washing and drying all the glass so everything is clean for the next shift which obviously couldn t be done since they still had all their glass i wouldn t expect people to immediately leave once it roll around to closing time but an hour is excessive especially when they can clearly see u cleaning everything up my manager even got frustrated and he s one of the most easygoing manager at the restaurant no idea how they tipped but i hope it wa decent
just a shitty night when i came in there wa a table taking up both the top in my section and a top so i only had two top and one four top in my section the bartender had them and said they were an awful party and about minute after i got there they closed out their four beer and said they were going to wait for the rest of their party before they order the bartender offered them to me but since she had just told me how awful they were i said no it s fine they stayed the entire night they were there at least until i left none of the other server let me have a four top in their section so i got four table the entire day and made this is in addition to me going to college almost full time i m one class short having a project due tomorrow an exam i need to study for with my textbook that still hasn t arrived and a shit show of a family life it s just been an overall shitty day and usually i look forward to work making me forget about my shit for a while but unfortunately i had one table at a time tonight so that didn t work i hope everyone else s shift went better than this one
yesterday i wa managing a shift during lunch with one of my server her head count for the lunch shift wa which is a lot during a lunch shift with only one server we had one too arrive a woman in her s maybe and her two elderly parent when they arrived there were many table still in the restaurant finishing up we have a big floor so it often appears the server isn t around when in reality they are on the other side taking care of table that s where i come in i sat the table watered them and got their drink order promptly made some conversation with them told them their server will be right with them i went to the bar got the drink ready and handed them off the the server to get to the table this took all of minute to get the drink on the table we don t have a bartender busser or anyone else just me and the server the server wa there and tried to take their order but they took quite some time to get their order in now this server is new to serving she doesn t have the year of experience some of the other server have only month and doing a lunch shift is a lot for her but what she lack i pick up for her while training her how to prioritize and handle matter appropriately when she is the only one on the floor their order wa oddly specific the two mom and daughter got bowl of soup and calamari to share a their entree the father got an actual entree and a salad that come with it they requested everything to be brought out at the same time the server communicated with me that this is how they wanted everything and i did hear them order it that way a well so she did everything she wa supposed to do correctly the dish are ready i put them in the tray in the kitchen and hand them off to the server she brings them out and everything is fine she return to the table and they say everything is fine we ll while i wa setting another table nearby they call me over and tell me one of the soup is too thick and the other soup taste burnt fine i ask if they would like u to remake them they say no they are rude and giving me dirty look which they were doing from the moment they walked in the door i start telling them about our rd soup we have and offer them a taste of it to see if they would like to have that one since they don t want u to remake the soup they chose they agree i go to the kitchen ladle up a sample for them and take it out now one of the woman agreed to taste and the other didn t when i asked she said no so i only brought one sample and of course the woman who told me she didn t want a sample grabbed it out of her mom s hand and complained to me about how i didn t bring her one fine whatever they agree to the new soup when i wa in the kitchen the soup de jour wa low so i told them to make a new one asap went back into the kitchen to tell them they were ordering two new soup soup ticket don t go to the kitchen since server grab it for themselves and told them to rush it the kitchen ha no sense of urgency when it come to soup they are constantly messing up the consistency of all soup because they don t pay attention and when the server tell them it s wrong they give major attitude and don t fix it promptly it s completely embarrassing that we can t manage to bring soup in a timely manner or at the right consistency but this is an ongoing issue that s been happening for a long a i have worked there and it s never been addressed the owner wa there and she specifically insinuated that i am not to comp their soup for them she is very finicky about making sure that there are no loss any other restaurant i ve worked at i would have had that luxury however where i am now it s not a thing we do even when sometimes it is on u i tried being polite and making conversation with the table watering them my presence on them wa overbearing for them but i wa getting shit from the owner to keep my presence there which in turn just ended up making the server look bad they acted like everything wa fine and then went home and wrote a horrible lengthy email full of lie claiming it took the server forever to get to their table claiming the place wa empty even though it wa the o clock lull and it wasn t actually empty claiming all of their food wa cold even though they took forever to eat it turtle pace claiming it took forever to get the order in but other table received their food before them probably because they were there before them and didn t take minute to choose claiming it took me to bring them a sample and then that it took me to bring the soup our after they reordered made a crack at me for asking them if they were form the area which i wa doing to make conversation because we have a frequent diner program and we also get a lot of traveler because of our location but in the email she suggested that i wa suggesting that something wa wrong with them not liking the soup because they aren t from around the area meanwhile i wa just trying be personable suggested the soup wa frozen and then we had to microwave it and that s why it took so long everything we make from scratch and we don t microwave a single thing unless a customer specifically request it which is normally only a cup of coffee because they prefer it piping hot saying their server wa horrible and gave bad service there s so much more i can keep going anyways the owner got the email and forwarded it to me and the server and now we need to go in early today to talk to her about it she s pissed but in reality this whole thing is the kitchen fault we both did everything we could if the kitchen could manage to get the soup right for once this would have happened if they bothered to get the new soup prepared in time they wouldn t have had to wait there would have been no problem with people like these people one thing go wrong and suddenly everything becomes questionable and they start twisting everything into a much worse scenario than it is fed up with the kitchen lack of urgency in regard to this sort of thing i plan on fighting this email with the owner yelling her about how this woman completely lied and also telling her that i am fed up with the kitchen and that if they don t get their crap together then i will not be held accountable for customer complaint regarding the food quality

this party wa such a light in an otherwise very frustrating few week at work lady from a book club came in and one of them brought her baby the first lady got there minute before the others started to arrive ordered a drink and told me not to worry about doing a round of water and that everybody would be paying separately the rest of the group trickled in and every time i went to the table i didn t have to yell or talk over anybody i wa never ignored the baby wa quiet everybody knew what they wanted and were low maintenance on refill and change they didn t leave the table a mess and everybody thanked me on their way out we re just a neighborhood bar so bill very varying level of pretty cheap but everybody left at least if not more it wa honestly just nice to feel really seen and acknowledged by a table they weren t a big money table but they were all just very sweet and pleasant to interact with and it wa so refreshing really made a hard week a little easier
so this is going to be a long one with a bit of backstory let get into it i manage a cake shop cafe we specialise in ready to buy birthday cake we are a very small store pretty much from every corner you can hear whats going on out the front we also have a camera view of the entire shop front with a viewing screen out the back so i saw and heard everything in the lead up to my encounter with the customer just over a week ago on a friday a very busy day for u a lady came into the store to buy a birthday cake for her son should be a very normal situation i don t usually pay attention to whats going on front of house because that s what the service staff are for i wa busy out the back making custom cake order for the weekend but my ear perked when i hear her asking for discount on the product in the display case our display is always full of fresh cake the cake she ended up picking wa only finished and ready for sale about an hour before she brought it i had a bad feeling she wa going to be a problem customer so i wa getting ready to go out to speak with her if needed but she ended up happily getting the cake after being told the cake were fresh and we had no discounted cake today by the service staff that s the end right no about hour later my co worker ill call him d from hear on take a call i didn t hear both side but d wa explaining it to me a the conversation wa going on i wa elbow deep in cheesecake so i didn t just grab the call myself so this lady is saying she brought a cake earlier today after she got home she ate a sprinkle out of the box that fell off the cake and say it disgusting she want a full refund or a replacement cake because she think the sprinkle are stale i tell d to ask her what it taste like and to explain sprinkle are just condensed sugar a colouring they don t taste great on their own and the batch in question wa delivered fresh to u just day before she asks d to promise we will replace the cake he explains we cant promise that but we would be happy to come up with a suitable solution for her if she could bring the cake and her receipt back into the store so we could understand what wa going on she scream at him over the phone it couldn t understand what she wa saying but i could hear the screaming coming from the phone she hang up before anything else could be said minute late i see her enter the store with the cake box in hand she will be called crazy cake b tch ccb from hear on d go out to try to help ccb he open the cake to see ccb ha jammed her own pirate decoration and candle in to the cake roughly the top destroyed some of the frosting is squished onto the side of the box and the happy birthday writing on top is damaged we have a pretty firm refund policy once a cake ha left the store it can not be refunded for change of mind and we are not meant to allow foreign object into the bakery her pirate decoration after going through ccb s complaint again d offer to directly fix the problem remove the sprinkle and replace them with a new layer of cream and chocolate flake or different sprinkle of her choice free of charge for her trouble he also offer to fix the other damage she caused free a well this is not good enough ccb yell at him that it bullshit and it not good enough the sprinkle taste like shit i need a replacement cake or a full refund d say he need to talk with the manager and asks for her receipt she doesn t have it d brings the cake back to show me ccb is angry and i want to deal with this a cleanly a possible so i call the owner and ask for advice the owner think the customer is shit talking to get freebie but agrees it would be better to have this end cleanly tell me to give ccb a half refund and offer to still fix the cake and give it back i take the cake back out to her and explain what i can do i make sure i m a kind and apologetic a possible at this point she ha been in the store for minute total the store is also full of other customer she still complains it not good enough and asks why i cant just give her a full refund and a brand new cake i say i m very sorry it ha left the store and ha had object put into it so we cant take it back the sprinkle are fresh and there doesn t appear to be anything wrong with it i m sorry you don t like them we are more than happy to replace them and refund half the money for the trouble the cake is on a little bench between u our conversation ha lasted second i see a look come over her face and she say under her breath y know what and she grab for the cake i think oh she s gonna storm out nope ccb open the box lift it open and brings it cake down on me at full force just some perspective i m a medium build mid twenty female ccb is at least and rather large i m lucky that i m quick enough to get my hand up to stop the cake so it doesn t come down on my head but of course it a light sponge cake with cream so it break up and shower all over me and the shop floor ccb immediately leg it out of the store d come from out the back having seen it from the security camera screen and follows her to the parking lot and take a picture of her and her car d say she tried to run him over getting out another customer also follows her and get her licence plate a well i m still standing there covered in cake in front of a shop full of customer i excuse myself out the back take off the cake covered apron and hat wash it off my arm and face then go out to apologise to the other customer in the store and start cleaning the floor the panic start to settle in me and i start feeling a strained pain in my right arm where i took most of the force of the cake box hit my brain still pretty foggy so i don t think to call police or security this is an insane story a it is but it just get worse not even half an hour later i m still cleaning cake from everywhere btw d take a phone call from our regional manager ill call him rm it a franchise we are singularly owned but governed by a head office rm is furious and demand we will be giving ccb s husband a full refund saying it now company policy that we give out refund no matter what d ask if he s heard the full story rm say no i don t care give the damn refund husband will be in to pick it up in minute then hang up when d tell me i immediately try to call back no answer so i call my store owner owner is pissed rm stepped in to do that but tell u to comply for the moment because if she wa violent before we don t want to aggravate the husband i have no clue how they contacted rm so quickly the only people with access to his number are employee my best guess is she went to a store in the franchise and lied her way to getting them to call him pretty much on the dot the husband come into the store he s quite and take the money from d we get him to sign a from saying he s taken the money just a he s about to leave he shout back so this mean you ll delete the picture d say no husband repeat you ll be deleting the photo i walk out the front stupidly i now realise and say i wont they re going straight to the police husband look me dead in the eye point at me and say if you do ill be back and it wont be cake you ll be cleaning off the floor i shout back a he s leaving now i can add threat to my police report stupid courage is apparently a symptom i get when scared i finished up everything i needed to and updated the owner and asked for her to download and send me the cctv and i headed to the police station to make a report no way am i letting them get away with treating people like this i made that initial report that day and wa going to come back with the cctv the next day but ohh it get crazier i get a message through our store facebook from someone who know ccb including screenshots from the ccb s facebook of her bragging about the entire incident she go a far a admitting to the assault and admitting to getting her husband to threaten physical harm if we went to the police so i took all of that to the police too a well a going to the doctor to get my arm checked he recorded elbow and triceps sprain damage and swelling also got him to make a note of emotion stress and anxiety from the threat the investigator think it will go to court for assault but i m still waiting to hear anymore from them i ve barely slept this week my arm getting better quickly so that s good at least i m so paranoid everyday at work that they ll come back or find where i live but i couldn t stay quite and let them get away with it ill update if anything new happens it been really nice to get this off my chest and write it down i would love to post the footage with this but i m worried it could effect the case quick update i went back to the doctor i have soft tissue damage in my right arm from my elbow to my shoulder from where i put my arm up to defend myself ive also been pull on light antianxiety medication sleeping pill to try and get some rest ive also been in contact with the police apparently ccb and husband have been dodging call and not answering the phone they say cctv and the social medium post isnt enough for them to be charged with out the opportunity to give their side of the story but if they dont answer soon a warrant will be put out for them and their car
first time posting and am on mobile so please excuse any error a little information for you i live in the deep south and work for a very popular local seafood restaurant in my area people come from all over the country to try our seafood and we are often very busy especially during crawfish season lent the owner are very nice people and will do almost anything they can to make the customer happy that is fine however people often take advantage of this and often are incredibly rude trust me between myself and my coworkers we have seen it all the place where i work employ a lot of high school and college student and in order to help u maintain a working life and keep up with school we close fairly early during the week night o clock monday thursday and o clock on sunday but when i say close i mean we stop taking order so someone could come in at on a monday night and stay until they just wouldn t be able to order anything yes this actually happened the most annoying part of all of this is that most of our side work can t be started until everybody leaf so this happened a couple of month ago probably around october this particular story isn t anything too bad but it just go to show how entitled some of the people we deal with are it wa a thursday night and during the late summer fall we usually aren t terribly busy we had started cleaning up and getting ready to leave about minute before closing and everyone wa pretty much ready to leave we had a couple of table but they were finishing up and i thought i wa going to get home early but of course that s not what happened about five minute before we close a big group of about or people came in our policy is if you are in the restaurant before you can order and of course these people took their precious time deciding what they want they finally ordered at and to make matter worse they ordered three order of snow crab which is very messy and easily take longer to get ready than anything else in addition it meant our boiler had to stay an extra fifteen to twenty minute waiting for the order to be ready so not only wa the wait and kitchen staff aggravated but so wa the boiler but their food come up and they take their time eating even though it is obvious we were closed and ready to go we had stacked the chair up on the other side of the restaurant which we only do if people seem to not be aware that we are closed or they just don t care the light in seafood market were off and just about all of my coworkers were sitting in the waiting area on their phone finally about thirty minute after we closed one of the woman from the table get up and start heading towards the counter i wa relieved a i think she just need a to go box but of course i wa wrong me hi do y all need some to go box rl rude lady actually i wanted to place an order to go this happens fairly often and usually people are understanding so like i usually do i told her our kitchen had closed thirty minute ago and that i wa sorry rl i just want some chicken it s for my daughter me i m sorry but we shut down our kitchen half an hour ago everything is turned off rl well can t you just turn it back on me i don t think they can do that ma am rl are you kidding me all i want is some chicken and it s not even for me it s for my daughter is there any way you can do it for me me everything is already put up or shut down rl pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaase pretty please rl began to beg like a five year old girl asking her parent to buy her a chocolate bar and it wa almost embarrassing i m not even kidding everything in me wanted to be like yes let me have the cook turn everything back on again dirty up all the dish we just cleaned and stay an extra ten to fifteen minute longer because you came in minute before we closed and just now decided you want chicken me i m sorry there isn t anything i can do rl can you go back and ask if they can do it me ma am i promise you they already closed rl can you please just go check i wa pretty aggravated at this point a i wa trying to do my side work and she had wasted a good five minute of my time but her insisting i go ask the kitchen to confirm what i already knew only made me angrier our kitchen manager work full day on thursday and she wa still there making sure everything wa being done correctly so i went up to her and explained everything that wa happening km kitchen manager what s wrong with you me this lady won t leave me alone about some chicken tender and i ve been telling her we are closed please just tell me you can t so she will leave me alone km well let me see if we still have the batter me km please before she could say anymore one of the cook confirmed that shocker everything wa turned off and the batter wa thrown away already so i went to tell her this but rl still didn t seem to get it me ma am they said everything is off and shit down for the night rl okay so what am i supposed to tell my daughter me i don t know but we can t make it rl this is ridiculous y all didn t even tell me the kitchen wa closing first of all that s isn t even our responsibility and secondly we told her and her entire party that this wa going to be the last order and the kitchen wa going to be shutting down after that i had been up since that morning and had come to work directly after school so naturally i wa pretty grumpy i wa getting sick of this lady but thankfully my supervisor walked back to the counter me supervisor can you please help this lady rl she said you can t make me a chicken basket i have the money for it right here s ma am or kitchen closed over half an hour ago we can t do that rl this is ridiculous i guess my daughter just won t eat tonight and she stormed back to her table my supervisor looked at me and i explained what had happened s if she need chicken that badly she should just go to mcdonalds there is literally one a mile either way down the road me i don t know but i am done with people the group ended up not leaving until o clock but i had gotten all my work done and wa able to leave after we had stacked all the chair i just wonder if she ever went and got chicken

trying to book a room online but it s now after midnight and the site had stopped working he say he book online all the time his whole family work for peschi so he know how the site should work i thought it wa odd that he said there wa a problem when he had just stated the cut off time but i offered him to use our computer in the lobby a maybe he wa trying to book for next day then his phone rang and he took a call i wa going to wait for him to end his call but he began pulling his card and id out and setting them on the desk so i began booking a room for him on my terminal before i ran his card i ran over the detail for his stay and checked that he wa okay with the price about he wa not he told his call to hold put it on speaker then began insisting he had booked online but it had stopped working and he should have a room booked for which might have been true however the site stop working at midnight and will only book for the next day i assume he wa cut off before actually reserving and i began to explain why the site wasn t working and he cut me off saying he wa aware his whole family work for peschi so he know how it work yet he still insisted on the original price and began telling me to call the number because since the site had stopped working while he wa using it he should get the pricing which the call wouldn t have helped either a the site again stop working at midnight to reset for the next day no exception i decided to try to descalate the situation and call my manager who again correlated no online pricing can only be booked online a they offer other promotion we don t offer in the hotel so i make my way to the front and once again begin to explain my apology sir but the online price are only offered online a they offer other promotion that we do not offer in the hotel he cut me off again saying he know a his whole family including him now work for the company but is still insisting he be given the online price because the site stopped working at midnight his call who wa still on speaker listening tell him to ask for a manager so he asks for a manager who i tell him is in at tomorrow morning he asks who i wa on the phone with then insists i call my manager back and tell him to come in to talk to him at this point i figure this guy is either trying to scam me or is trying to scare me into giving him a room and i m not having it i tell him no and said i wa sorry but if he worked for the company he should know the online cut off wa midnight and if he wa not happy with the price he could go somewhere else he and his call begin yelling at me and i began giving him other property option to which he threw his card at me and told me he doesn t need other option he ha a platnium card ohhhh my mistake your highness i pick it up from the floor and slid it back to him and tell him i m sorry but your card isn t good here he start yelling again and tell me i m a dumb stupid bitch noice and he know i m a stupid bitch because i work for peschi yes i do like your whole family y all i have never seen someone step in their own shit and get so mad about it he go white and start yelling again calling me obscenity accuses me of being discriminatory then call me a dumb white bitch i m mexican but ok then yell something about minimum wage and suing and walk out adding i d better hope he doesn t come back again i m bad at confrontation and i get the shake after a bit so once my jitter go down i take out my binder with all of the number of the surrounding property and call him in since i had began making a folio for him i still had his full name and address along with a car make that i got from my camera block they all agree to a dnr and since my guy had a platnium card i called my partner swanky property in case he decided to drive further and he wa put on a dnr list to all hotel in my area and at the one across town schnoogens i m not bothered by the yelling i get shitty attitude all the time along with all kind of entitlement everyone ha a platnium card when they think it ll get them somewhere my thing is of all the scam to try to use you thought going with my whole family work at peschi would work vato i wa born at night but not last night if you work here you know the cut off for online booking and bullshit is midnight tldr guy come in to get online pricing for same day after midnight get told no and get mad and he call his whole family stupid update he came back i ll post a seperate update

f i m pretty new to being a hospo i have been working at this restaurant for month a a part timer to support myself financially while pursuing my bachelor degree i often get drunken old men hitting on me at first i didn t know how to react and would feel shitty about it but a time go on i kinda have accepted the fact that it s just how it is like doesn t mean that it should be working in a restaurant people say shit when they are drunk and i get that so i no longer take it personally but the other day there were men they were huge buffy and all came in they were totally sober ordered mostly soft drink only ordered beer they were super loud but what did i expect men talking at the same time it would have been even louder if they were all woman just saying lol one dude actually touched my hand on purpose but pretended it wa an accident a i wa pouring his beer he began asking me for my name may i ask why do you need to know my name i asked c mon it s just a name what s the big deal i m sorry but i may have to refuse the request of disclosing my name oh c mon tell u your name a few of them joined in i smiled and walked away i came back and forth to deliver the rest of the drink order and started taking the food order my manager also came by to check on them a couple of time to see if they were happy with everything the same dude who asked for my name told her that i didn t want to tell him my name in a disappointed tone she asked me in private why i didn t just tell them just make up a name if i wa not comfortable with revealing my real name she listed out a bunch of name that could possibly suit my appearance i wa shocked that she asked me to comply with their demand anyway a i wa walking towards them to deliver them their food i could tell that she wa having her eye on me the same dude asked me again for my name this time in an even flirtier tone so i said ok so if you really want to know the of them suddenly stopped talking and listened to what i had to say you can call me february this month i had all of their eye on me i continued and next month i ll be march they were talking flirty to me the whole night i wa uncomfortable yes i went home that night with the thought that they would follow me lucky they didn t what i said to them wa total bullshit it didn t mean anything didn t stop them from being flirtatious towards me didn t act a a confrontation or anything but at least that got me away with that question anybody had the same experience with these type of customer how did you deal with them
i am happily no longer employed in hospitality but during my final semester of college i worked the front desk at a lower end brand of a major international hotel chain call it the fartyard by warriott the best part of that job wa my lovely coworkers and manager the worst part wa being blamed by guest for legitimate issue that were entirely out of my control such a the property being badly in need of renovation the astronomical price of canned wine at the market and service animal that were clearly pet being allowed at our pet free establishment being allowed by our gm probably the worst behaved guest i met were a couple who smoked in the room and when confronted with the evidence that they had smoked in the room refused to pay the fee they proceeded to scream at my manager and came up with some of the most ridiculous story i ve ever heard to try and get out of paying the fee we re not smoker i don t know or care about your personal habit and whether you consider yourself a smoker but before you checked into the room it wa clean and now there are cigarette ash and cigarette butt in it and it reek of smoke so you owe u we re from out of state we re not even from here all this tell me is that when you re at home you frequent hotel and cause similar problem my girlfriend doesn t even smoke she go to college they drug test you at college most of the pothead and cig fiend i know are college student i ve never heard of drug testing at college how could we have smoked in the room we were drinking last night we were so drunk we were blackout there s no way we could have been smoking sure it s true these lovely people had showed up around am on a saturday wasted out of their mind and had been checked in by our woefully inexperienced night auditor who had somehow managed to only collect the room cost not tax and fee the system auto suggests room plus tax when checking in walk in so i don t even know what happened there so the tax had to be taken out of their security deposit adding another wrinkle to an already deeply unpleasant situation my manager ha an amazing poker face and kept calmly asking for the despite the profanity and nonsensical excuse these people kept throwing at her finally the guest paid up probably the worst part of the whole ordeal wa how he stuck his finger in his mouth and made sure to touch each bill with that finger before handing them to my manager i don t miss that job good luck to all of y all still on the front line
i m not sure this is the proper subreddit but this happened a few year ago and is slightly different than most story because it not a complaint about customer but more an oversight by an drunk bos anyway i started a job a a line cook at a fairly popular bar near a college campus i had prior experience a a line cook so it wasn t all totally new it wa a bar that served typical bar food pizza wing burger and the like there are in the kitchen at once that handle everything from food prep to dish my first night wa a weeknight and not to crazy i got a brief introduction on how everything worked and the basic on how the equipment worked my second night which wa a friday i wa supposed to work with the same guy but he got fired or didn t show up so i wa alone i had no idea what most of the sandwich were because i never frequented the place before getting hired all the bartender server were half drunk and no help by so i grabbed a menu and tried to make the food by the description i had to make pizza and had never done that before i didn t know what size were what how long to cook anything it wa a nightmare and being friday night it wa packed i made it through somehow i came in the next day on saturday for the lunch shift it wa college football season so the place wa again packed this time another cook showed up and left me to do all the prep for the day while he got hammered with the server before we opened he wa a nice fellow and offered me some of his crystal meth to smoke when we had a break i declined so i ended up cooking alone again and luckily these drunk people were happy drunk and didn t complain about much i ended up working there for year and it turned out to be a very fun job looking back on it now i m not sure how i put up with all i did i don t drink so i wa generally left a the only sober person in the building including the drunk staff owner wa in there constantly hammered i ended up getting fired because they hired a guy to manage the place and he felt i didn t respect or listen to him i didn t but the firing wa a blessing because at my next job i ended up meeting my wife so i can t complain i have many story that are nsfw about my time there
so this happened tonight arrive get audit started no biggie an older late s gentleman come up and asks if there s a lot of drug activity etc around the hotel now i ve been at the hotel for year and while i can t say there s been none we re talking like maybe twice x a year we might have some problem i m thinking maybe this guy is worried about keeping stuff in his truck or something hopefully not asking where to get the drug however i tell him no not really and he launch into a minute tirade about the black truck he just saw next door at the gas station and how they are following him and this ha been going on for year and the police have told him that they can t do anything if no one is actually confronting him about anything how the fbi is following him via his phone you get the picture i wa really expecting hm to start yammering about trump in some fashion now i really wanted to just tell him that it sound like he is paranoid and that he doesn t need to call the fbi he need to call a psychiatrist because he need to be on some kind of medicine but what do you do you can t argue or reason with someone who is out of their mind delusional and paranoid so i pretty much just kept quiet trying to interject a few time to get him to shut up and direct him back to his room told him if i saw anyone or anything i would inform the right people which would be no one finally he went back to his room wrote something in the log to warn the rest of the staff about him he s here for day hopefully he won t bother other guest anyone here have any tip for dealing with the occasional delusional boomer

i have been in the industry for three year now a a full time night auditor like everyone else i ve seen some shit besides crazy insane story this also includes ignorance i often ask myself how guest have gotten to the spot they re in when they misunderstand very simple check in routine and policy now that common general ignorance i get just slip right by however twice now i ve run into this situation that really make me wonder how someone function i m about an hour and a half into my night audit shift and i ve only got four reservation left and it s a slow night awesome car pull up some young adult mid s maybe pop out with some luggage nice a check in they come in the delegater if you will approach the desk check in start like normal she ha two room one for her and one for her two friend we ll call her nat not all there nat and can you make sure we have the best view of the mountain too me well i can see on your reservation that you booked standard non view room nat i did not she pull up her confirmation e mail which doesn t have room type information which i find odd however it doe list the cheap rate she booked which helped me determine she did not book mountain view me i m sorry that the confirmation email did not provide room type option you may be able to find it on blooking dot com through a link there but otherwise your current booking state king room nat well can i upgrade one of the room to a mountain view me yes it ll be a upcharge so she agrees with the upcharge battle her authorization somewhat because it wa increased from her original quote because of the daily upcharge for her room type upgrade along with having to explain incidental but everything is cleared after a few minute they annoyingly buy some snack and off they go for i think in the moment the rest of the night nah i hear all three of them and the luggage cart from the elevator lobby a few minute later two of them wait by some bench near the elevator while nat come back to the desk nat so both of those room are on the same side i thought you said we were getting a mountain view i d like to switch room to their side me uh you were in room and even room number are facing the mountain nat yes me then you guy are on opposite side of the hallway even number room are facing the mountain nat but there are no mountain outside of their window it s just a parking lot me right it s midnight it s dark out and you won t be able to see the mountain nat we wanted to be able to take a picture and now you re telling me there s not a mountain view me there is a mountain view there won t be if i move them to a room on your side the mountain aren t exactly close to u so on any given night you won t see them when it s dark out nat uhh do you have a picture of the mountain view or something she still wasn t convinced i opened up a photo from our website featuring a mountain view image from one of our room i showed it to her and she go yeah we can t see that from the room and i have to remind her again that on any given night when it s dark out you won t see the mountain after some back and forth with me and her friend they finally took the risk and went back upstairs
this happened a couple of year ago but it wa the most unsafe i had ever felt in a restaurant i worked a a server assistant in a family steakhouse the original owner retired and sold his restaurant to some millionaire ceo who changed everything it wa a place of memory for a lot of the local and it wa affordable since you could order steak by the ounce but the management changed it to an overpriced steakhouse for the ceo to brag about to his friend and clientele when they renovated the place they split it into a bar section and family section in the bar side they only hired pretty young girl no guy on that side except for the bartender later they enforced a uniform that wa a short black wrap dress that showed their cleavage for some of the girl you could practically see their underwear everyone thought the dress wa ridiculous but only one girl refused to wear it the bar side also had le tip a most people didn t order a full meal the only plus to working on that side wa if you got to serve the owner he would leave for the tip those girl would try to get promoted so they could serve in the family section since i wa an sa i didn t really see much that wa going on in the bar side just that there wa a high turn around for those waitress one day a server in the family section abruptly stopped showing to work while it wa common for people to quit i wa surprised because she had really good work ethic and didn t give her week notice likewise a lot of server started quitting and the business slowed down during one of the holiday rush a girl who wa promoted from bar side to the family side wa complaining because she got really shitty table then a lot of the male server were laughing at her i didn t hear exactly what they said but it seemed like they were slut shaming her it wasn t until later that i found out why i bumped into the coworker who quit suddenly at a store we started to catch up when she talked about a horrible incident i had no idea what she wa talking about and she said you don t know she told me that the upper management asked the bar waitress to join them for a drink then they said you re going to climb onto this bar and strip naked for u of course they said no basically the management got them drunk until they did i want to mention that the type of girl that wa hired in the bar position were usually the same nice ditzy kind of girl who had a hard time saying no and for some reason they were almost always brunette anyways one of the girl s boyfriend called worried about where she wa the management told her she wa not going to answer her phone she did anyway but they ended the call another girl s friend were worried about her since she wasn t answering her call they enter the restaurant and see what s happening they tell the management that they re taking their friend with them and the management actually tell them no they eventually get her back one of the girl wa and their parent wanted to sue for her but she didn t want to and since she wa a legal adult they couldn t without her permission i didn t have any doubt that it happened the manager would often ask the girl if they wanted a drink sometimes they d ask me a well but i would always laugh and so no thx cuz i wa a lightweight even shortly before i heard about this one of the manager that wasn t present at that incident made a rule there wa to be no drinking during or after work at the bar but of course the owner s brother still offered me and the other waitress drink i got the f ck out of there i called my friend who also worked there and also told her to get out of there i had worked there for month without knowing what had happened my friend and i were the only one who didn t know both girl the guy never told u some of which we were friend with instead they just slut shamed the girl it happened to although they were really slow around the time they left the restaurant is still open unfortunately the next workplace i wa employed at had it s own share of sexual harassment the owner and the owner s son would grope the waitress when the head chef found out his own daughter had been groped he didn t do anything his son daughter and brother were employed there
so far my time at my new hotel ha been pretty good other than a couple of cranky people among other thing i don t have to deal with a many homeless people and the hotel in general is much le shady than my last one particularly since it s newly remodeled oh and i have security some night for the most part it seems like our clientele particularly the one i deal with the most are trucker and laborer and i m fine with that sometimes though the kind of people who come in can be a bit questionable once at about am an hour before audit a guy walk in he wa your stereotypical working class gentleman no hang ups so far other than a few missing teeth walk in hi i would like to have a room me cheerfully and with a smile yeah sure we have plenty available what kind would you like walk in just a single bed would be fine i give him a rate for a room with a single king sized bed walk in that sound great so uh i m working on that big project here in town would it be alright if i just paid for tomorrow night since most of the night is already over me slightly taken aback by the suggestion unfortunately i can t do that especially since it s twelve hour before check in time even if you arrived after the audit there would be a early check in fee walk in come on i m a loyal customer i ll pay for tomorrow night me like i said i can t do that walk in can t you call a manager or something there wa no way i wa going to wake up any of my manager for such an obvious non emergency me this time of night the manager s asleep so i can t do that sorry walk in other hotel let me do that me unfortunately i really don t feel comfortable doing that after that the guy just left now honestly i can t quite understand what he wa thinking sure a good part of the night wa over but it wa still the previous night and our check out time is at noon so basically he wa expecting to be able to spend up to hour here but only have to pay for no not going to happen on my watch

first post not english native blah blah to the story so a little back story i work at a coffee place where they leave some croissant muffin and such on top of the bar for the waiter to serve them easily when someone enter they seat wherever they want and then i ll go and take the order and everything there wa an old man that will always come in grab a croissant then seat at the table and shout the order at me even when i wa serving someone else it didn t matter that i wa standing in front of the fucking tray of croissant grabbing some for other customer for the most part i just gave him dirty look and asked him to just please wait to be served in a really nice way anyway one day like a couple month ago i got really tiered of this shit cause some other regular saw him and went to grab some for himself so i just stopped the new dude and he wa cool with it and apologized everything fine but when i went to take the old man s order i told him something like good morning please sir i ll have to ask you not to grab food from the tray at the bar they are there for the waiter to serve not customer what can i get you today i don t think he liked that cause he told me yes i won t do it again and i will never come back either i just told him okay that work for me got his stuff he paid didn t left tip of course and left without any more fuss but today oh boy he came back sat at a table not his usual one wired and when i wa going to get the order he looked at me stood up and left so yeah that happened guess he remembered he wasn t coming back or something
early in the autumn a few year ago i had a table that wa sat outside on our patio facing the main strip of our city after they were sat the city had begun to do work on the sewage system just down the road delicious our patio wa in the damage radius too it smelled like sewage out there i realized that this wa happening when i went to deliver their drink and wa nearly ko ed by the smell you d think that they would see smell what wa happening and come inside and tell the host or me that they wanted a table inside right away it wa bad nope instead they decided to complain about it to me when i came outside can you ask them to stop we re trying to eat out here hahaha no i cannot i actually laughed we have table inside though it s totally fine in there the two of them look at each other like i m some kind of idiot then the lady look back at me and with a bunch of attitude go we wanted to dine outside today because it s nice and we can t do it with this smell we really want to sit outside and enjoy our dining experience what can you do to fix this situation nothing she stare at me for a second into my unwavering seriously lady wtf face they eventually went inside of course and proceeded to be annoyed the whole time forgot if they ever wrote a review or anything but they were miserable and punished my wallet for their inconvenience i m also fairly sure that it would be some kind of health code violation to walk up to an active sewage system maintenance task while i m at work a a server serving food bonus all sort of people that would ask u can you ask that guy a half block away to stop smoking that cigar nope there wa a sometimes very loud nightclub next door that people would complain about too can t do shit about that either i also posted a story about a lady that wa complaining that it wa too hot outside you re outside you dumbass i wa always bemused and would laugh at stuff like this but it always struck me and short circuited my brain for a moment when they would complain about environmental factor a if i could intervene

christmas spirit in the hotel biz is non existent so i work at a golf resort which during the winter there is no golfing so we kind of turn into a normal running hotel today we had a staggering checkins with only people staying over on top of that so about guest instead of today i thought would be pleasant since we re so close to christmas everyone must be in the christmas spirit right wrong now to preface this we have room with balcony with bed in them but they re both full then we have one with only a king in them then we have special room that are larger and some have the pull out couch while some don t we can always put rollaways into the room that don t have couch but we can t put them in room that already have bed in them about hour into my shift a man and his yo autistic son come in we start off with him already yelling at his son which all his son had done wa yell his word instead of talk softly and grabbed a luggage cart he asks to make sure that he got the larger king room with a pullout couch i check the room number and there s no couch so i tell him i m apologize but i don t have one with a couch in it i can however put a rollaway in it this wa fine with him next thing i know his wife come barreling at me saying that this is unacceptable i need a larger room with a pullout on a higher floor and took way too long to walk down to i look through everything again and even pull out room that are prebooked for upcoming stay which most of the people were coming in tomorrow or the day after these people are staying a week so i find a room on the nd floor and the first floor room on the second floor didn t have a pullout couch but took le time to walk to by maybe second difference their original room wa on the second floor a well but wa all the way at the end of the corridor it wa unacceptable i bring them down to the first floor the room is handicap is a larger room ha a pullout couch but it s unacceptable because it ha a handicap bathroom and she doesn t like the layout of it so i asked if a balcony with bed would work she asks well is it queen no it s full oh well that won t work at all forget about that i bring her back to my computer trying to figure out what the hell to do the next room that i could use ha a block on it which mean i can t move the people that are prebooked into that room the next two were down for maintenance the following two had people in them the very last room i had didn t have people coming in until the day after christmas but they were set to a large handicap room on the th floor with a pullout couch even after i gave her that option she asked if there wa one without the handicap room i m like lady i just took a room from someone else to move you into it that s the last and only room i had available she took the room on the sixth floor and wa still upset about having to deal with a handicap bathroom i hate myself for even bothering with going through all that trouble when she wa still mad at me i even gave away someone s room and had them moved down to the first floor so that our high tiered cb could get what she wanted also the entire time i wa trying to help them she kept yelling at her son to stay put instead of just coming with u to look at room i am really hoping that the rest of my week change
stupid guest keep on surprising me even after year in the industry a guest call down to me and complains that the room is too cold and i work in a certain part of the world where it is quite cold now so i understand that people coming from warmer area need high temperature to feel warm and comfortable so i grabbed with me a small heater we have many of them because we always get a i m cold call and i proceeded to knock on the man s door not surprisingly an obviously annoyed old man opened up the door and rushed me to our termometer he told me that it wa not working because it couldn t be set higher than a certain degree but i explained that unfortunately it is supposed to be so however some room are actually colder than others i then plugged the heater in the wall and said that the room soon would be warmer while also explaining that i wish i could give him another room but that we are fully booked and i literally have no room he got very annoyed and it seemed like he thought that i could magically create a new room for him if the last room i had wa a suite he would get it to make him happy i then said that he can come and get a better room tomorrow he just kinda kicked me out of his room and on the way out he said i think you gave very bad service why don t you just give me a new room i answered with i m really sorry but we are fully boo slam door in my face i couldn t help but laugh on the way down and telling my colleague about this sometimes people are just so stupid and can t even understand something a easy a when you are fully booked you have no room unless if you want to overbook and maybe have to turnaway another guest either way someone is gonna complain thanks for reading

there might be other part to this depending on what happens with this guy i now work in a small chicago hotel that ha suite in one of the city s coolest hood outside of downtown where most come for a night or to visit their kid at the local university or attend concert at the venue down the street we also have some deal with some insurance company where we do extended stay to local in certain area who have had flooding fire or property damage in their current residence that said we have a guy who is here for night and checked in last thursday due to this insurance situation all tax are waived and the company is paying for the room the guest of course only ha to do incidental and anything he would purchase via our extremely tiny shop by shop i mean we sell a few snack item like chip and candy bar and we keep a fridge behind the desk with beer and soda and juice that s it none of this however is relevant to the story what is relevant to the story is that last thursday he checked in i wa told something wa a bit off with him when i arrived on friday night shortly after my shift began i saw a short skinny dude who had come downstairs to go out for a smoke a we don t allow smoking on the property i happened to be outside having a smoke myself and the guy started talking to me he told me the room number and how his friend checked him in for me that sounded odd because of what i had already known about this room being one of the insurance company room i thought at first maybe he made a mistake in what he said or maybe i misunderstood this wa right around midnight i saw the guy for the first time forward a couple of hour and some tall guy with a beard came through the door with a room key now i didn t question it because i had been off for day he could have been a guest in another room however i noticed the elevator had stopped on the rd floor okay fine no worry so i let it go it wasn t until around now that i noticed the short guy and this guy coming down the back elevator and walking out the back entrance my crackhead sens began to tingle i ran to the camera in the back office and watched these two were outside the tall one wa on his phone he would look at his phone and look around and then go back to his phone the shorter one approached one of our ground floor room with the patio entrance wa he just looking don t know why he would a it wa occupied this went on and on for about minute until they both disappeared through the property next door a our hotel is connected to condo s and there is a sidewalk that connects the a few minute later the short guy came back and went to the room this whole situation wa my first big hmmm besides anyone in the industry know the feeling that indescribable feeling that something is up whether you call it a gut feeling or spidey sense or crackhead alarm you know what i m talking about so this taller guy wa in this room for a couple of hour disappeared and never came back nothing else happened that night so let go to saturday night my next night working once again i saw this skinny little dude a few time that night though around am the guest who s name is on the room come back with a new guy this next

doesn t sleep a i see him many time throughout the night another hmmm a couple of time in the night i see this guy walk down the hallway on the same floor and then go back into the room how do i see this i am making sure to rewind the camera s every chance i get nothing else of note really happened again until a few hour later when the short guy that i had met while smoking come downstairs around am sunday and take off in an uber shortly after the guest who s name is on the room brings this guy luggage down and asks me to hold it a he will come get it later wait what i assumed that this guy wa maybe his roomie boyfriend bff brother and wa staying the whole time with him yet another hmmm this wa now on sunday morning it wa now sunday morning and my amazing co worker who also usually work na except on sunday and monday she work morning came in and i filled her in on this guy she said she too would investigate after i told her my suspicion now that said i am overly suspicious most of the time due to everything that i went through in san francisco and how of the people there are crack head using fake credit card i thought maybe just maybe it wa me over reacting no it wasn t sunday night i came to work most of the night wa uneventful until around am when the guy that had arrived the night before left in an uber he wa there for a whole night at least and not just for a couple of hour and the guest left for about an hour and came back again with yet a brand new person i had never seen the same chick worked monday i made sure to fill her in on that and i left i wa off until friday night friday night i came in for the first or so hour i didn t see or hear anything out of the ordinary it wasn t until around am guy i had never seen before came downstairs one of which left in an uber and the other when back upstairs again with the elevator stopping at the rd floor i checked the camera again to see if it wa the same room it wa here we go again shortly after the registered guest come down to the front and go outside within a few minute there is yet another new guy he ha gone up with sigh around am this guy that had just arrived and one of the first guy leave

couple of night they never sleep and the guy leaf early in the morning and come back late at night what other option is there i will definitely be sending update because this is very suspicious situation
so i work the pm shift at my hotel and the primary night auditor is notorious for staying min after her shift on the clock to either finish thing up or i needed to pas thing on and my gm doe not want anyone to go into overtime unless she say so so my manager solution extend my shift to pm every night so now the night auditor work am to cut her hour back hour to leave room for her lingering on the clock at first i wa like okay that s dumb but at least now i am getting hour overtime instead of her doesn t really solve the problem but i wasn t going to complain about extra money on my paycheck well now this week my manager cut me a shift i only work day instead of i m just so confused why we have to make up this stupid schedule just so one person doesn t go into overtime like right her up threaten to cut her shift since she cant help but go into overtime there is no other employee that stay on the clock that long and that consistent
my vacation is off to a bad start there wa some blowing snow in toronto and i missed my connection due to weather there wa no booking until the next day i am due to fly to miami and stay in a hotel on miami beach for a few day before a cruise i booked the miami hotel directly through the hotel even though it wa a little more due to all the story here when my flight wa delayed i called the hotel to let them know i would be a day late to hold my room she said that since i booked direct she can just amend my reservation and i will not have to pay for the missed day now i do not have to pay for a hotel in toronto and miami thanks tale from the front desk for all your great story and advice p i will be leaving good review for the hotel when my vacation is over
so english is my second language and although i can speak it on a pretty high level i ve had some very bad day one of them happened year ago on a quiet january night i f at the time used to work in a small town chain hotel and tended the front desk by myself me coming in during winter wa unusual a i wa normally away for university but my bos needed me that weekend so i came in very tired and with a rusty english after basically not speaking it for a couple month around pm a car pulled up a white haired man came out leaving his wife in the car or so i thought and entered the lobby a he inquired about my rate i confirmed with him he only needed one bed and suggested a regular queen room which he agreed to book until then everything ran smoothly a i started filling his register card yes we filled walk in register card by hand i figured it would be a good idea to confirm how many people there were a one doe but instead of going with my regular for how many people which always did the trick my brain took an alternate path and thought why not go with just for the two of you a i wa convinced at that point there were two of them you might ask but what s wrong with asking just for the two of you the question is not what is wrong but what could go wrong the answer is a lot amp x b my tired brain couldn t handle this sudden change of routine so it went like this me just for the two of u customer rather confused and taken aback huh me stuttering a bit so just for the two of u huh sorry i mean just the two of you c huh no it s just me me rather confused and still stuttering oh yes sure sorry i had thought there were two of you so just for one person then for some reason he seemed to have gotten quite uncomfortable but i figured he wa annoyed by my rusty english a it often happens even in a region where no one speaks english amp x b i finished checking him in in a very awkward atmosphere well at least for him why just for him you ask because it hadn t hit me yet that i had replaced you with u and thereby literally suggested to an oblivious old man we take a room together at first i just felt embarrassed that i had assumed he wasn t alone but about half an hour later a i wa sitting behind my desk enjoying the silence i replayed the conversation in my head and the embarrassment hit me like never before i wanted to disappear deep into the ground not only had i said something incredibly unprofessional and not apologized properly i potentially could have put my y o self in danger had the man not been a decent i still think of that poor old man sometimes wishing i could ve told him how much i didn t mean to say that oh well
okay so i ve posted before a out being short staffed and it seems to have reached it breaking point our regional manager brought someone in from another location to clean thing up our location is already very clean and we follow procedure to a t well i come in at notice people in the lobby waiting on order are very agitated i ask our gm what s going on and she say that the lady from the other location i ll refer to her a oll from now on is dropping meat fresh for every order and making one burger sandwich at a time we usually have full tray of each meat so the maximum it normally take to get your meal is minute if we re waiting on fried or if we re waiting on chicken so little to no wait normally the past two hour have been absolute hell people waiting minute for one cheeseburger since shes doing order one at a time and dropping meat for each one customer have been livid been asked to do several refund and then oll get mad at me when i tell her it wa because of the wait time a few of the most notable over theadt few hour guy come in order a cheese curd and a fry shes also dropping fry for each individual order shes going down the screen order by order doesn t matter if it s just a pretzel or a fry it wait for it turn in the screen so this guy waited minute for a cheese curd and fry this man is screaming and yelling i eventually promo it off there have been a ton of comped meal and free sundae coupon given out lady at drive order six piece basket we let her know it s going to be about minute on chicken oll fry each six piece separately it took this woman minute to get all her chicken we had her pulled up and when i went to take it out she said she wa about to come in because she thought we forgot about her i m sure there ll be more because oll is here with u all night i think everyone is at their wit end gm is talking about quitting and everyone else said if she quits they do i can t i can t afford to even a much a i like her so i m at a loss about what to do update she finally left the rest of the night ran a bit smoother most of it wa ice cream but if there wa food ordered people still waiting minute on it gm told me that shes only here until sunday but everyone plan on quitting saturday a a fyou to the regional manager i m very worried this will only leave me and two other people working here i do not have the option of quitting i need the paycheck this is not enough to keep the location staffed even during one shift let alone all day rm may be able to pull staff from other store since this location make the most in the area and if they closed it even while hiring new people they d lose a ton of money i plan on starting to look at job this weekend just a a backup
firstly sorry for the lengthy rant okay so i started working at this japanese restaurant in my home town for about month it s a small place probably seat around depending on the night and it s really close to where i live so the commute is good i started working here because i liked the place and thought it would be cool to learn more about japanese food and culture at first i didn t think anything wa particularly bad about the place the food i got after my shift wa decent and although i wa making minimum wage at the start i wa assured this wa just because i wa in training and that i d start to make tip after i got more familiarized with the menu etc it wa only after i made the transition from trainee to server that thing started going downhill i wa told that per their policy i would start out making only of my cut of the tip while they payed me only an hour i wa assured that i could work my way up to by working and getting better at my job it wa kinda weird but i wa willing to put the time in to earn more tip since then i have worked there more month and am pretty familiar with every aspect of the restaurant i serve multiple table hand write every ticket have a good understanding of the menu work double shift when they need me do the dish because they have yet to hire a washer for more than a week prep food clean the entire restaurant and bathroom come in on time and am generally pretty agreeable to work with also since i started working there the place ha become incredibly understaffed and i ve been picking up everyone s shift to compensate despite all of this i still only make of the tip i earn and found out today that i m technically not allowed to interact with cash in any way despite having run the register for over a month at this point i thought this seemed ridiculous and asked the manager directly about it albeit through a translator a he speaks very little english after a minute discussion i discovered that apparently only waiter who are making of their tip are allowed to interact with the money i then asked how i might work toward making this a i wa already doing everything the were doing the answer i got wa a super runaround way of saying that it s just whenever they decide to raise my tip percentage and isn t actually based on my ability to work essentially everything i don t do in the restaurant is because either i m not allowed to do it or they refuse to teach me because that would mean paying me more amp x b and a a side note since i ve started working there the free meal i m given ha gone from proper meal on the menu to whatever this is tl dr my job won t pay me all my tip or let me touch cash despite me working there for month and doing the same amount of work a my coworkers
last night wa blissfully quiet no real problem which is nice this floated up for me though maybe some will find it entertaining my fun nye last year well i wa kinda hoping for an opportunity tonight to have to deal with a stupid local person on nye and i wa not disappointed i had left a note in the logbook this morning before i left work advising my person to be on the lookout for local people and to give them an opportunity to cancel v having to deal with me evicting them in the middle of the night so i arrive to work tonight and she say that there ha only been sketchy guest we will call him bryce because that wa his fucking name so bryce and his girlfriend foot pound of joy let call her tubjoy came in to the hotel about minute before my shift trying to check in with cash we like the majority of nice hotel no longer accept cash don t do deposit and require a credit card for checkin which my co worker let call her momager told bryce and tubjoy so after arguing with momager about it wanting to talk to a manager momager is fdm and such they say they are going to go put money on their card and come back they leave some baskin robbins here because it wa melting in the car ok so enter me gm grumpy man she just finish telling me about that finishing up changeover relay info and they come back in they say they have a reservation and i know it s them so bryce plop down a wal mart pre paid gift card valued customer i give it back and say i m sorry we don t take those we only take credit card now it s on bryce say it is a credit card because bryce is young and stupid i explain it is not a credit card it s a pre paid debit card and it s essentially just plastic cash we do not accept them tubjoy start up swearing at me and at that point in my head i ve already thinking yes now they won t be staying at all no matter what they complain that momager didn t tell them they couldn t use the pre paid debit card i tell them that momager specifically told them that we must have a credit card and that i m sorry sir but you are mistaken that a pre paid debit card is a credit card at this point tubjoy head back out to the truck a dirty truck that look like they using it to move a hoarder house bryce still continues to argue with me repeating the same stuff over and over again i don t understand why you have to have a credit card this is a credit card this ha on it i don t know why you can t accept it so very professionally i graciously offer bryce an explanation sir look this is why we and most hotel only accept credit card like most rule the reason why is because a few people have messed it up for everyone else many people coming in paying cash have no problem but then there are the one who come in smoke in the room trash the room do drug deal are prostitute vandalize the property or whatever etc and if they pay cash the hotel ha no way to recoup those cost that s why we only accept credit card and no that is not a credit card that s plastic cash after telling bryce i will cancel his room he walk out swearing and calling me a fucking punk ok bryce you little butt hurt child oh but it doesn t end there is still baskin robbins so because i don t want bryce and tubjoy to return i grab their ice cream and head out to give it to them before they leave i get them just a they are pulling out a soon a i get to their window they start arguing with me again and repeating the same thing i don t understand why you can t take this card look i ve already explained why we don t take them and if you do even a cursory search online you will see that this is the norm for most hotel clearly you don t stay in many hotel now even with a rude a you two have been i m happy to come bring you back your ice cream but even if you were to find a real credit card i m not selling you a room tonight because of your behavior so take your ice cream and go to which bryce insert again i don t understand why you can t take this card sir it s not my job to teach you or make you understand goodnight and walk back of course bryce add in one more whatever punk i wish i wa a rich a you i m sure you do bryce i m sure you do
it s a cold night at my florida flamton inn well it s degree which is cold to u i m standing at the front desk working my standard shift it is almost too quiet the phone ring i check it for the number it say internal the worst kind of call my hotel is not just bare bone crew past pm we are just bare the only worker in the entire room hotel is myself no other staff so internal call are the one bane of my existence because internal call often mean i have to leave the desk and suite shop unattended for who know how long to solve whatever issue the guest may be having i answer the phone i am greeted by the voice of a man who sound disgruntled he raspily say have you had any call of noise complaint complaint about the noise anyone called you about this noise i pause to see if there is more information he present none no i respond this is my first call about the noise there is a pause i hear faintly a noise of some kind coming through the phone i am uncertain if it is static or if this is the aforementioned noise can you tell me what you re hearing i say well there s a noise the man say ah a noise how foolish of me to misunderstand him my bad coming from somewhere on the floor you re on a neighboring room i coax attempting to learn what i must prepare for there is a pause and then well there s this noise coming from somewhere maybe it the room next to me i assure the keen eared but few worded prophet that i will check the room around him and issue any noise ordinance he mumbled something probably another allusion to the noise he is in room i head up to the second floor to sound out the hall our hallway don t hold noise very well you can hear most thing going on in a room if you walk by it the room are fairly soundproof on the inside though so anything that could be loud enough to be heard between room would be blaring in the hallway i approach room no noise nothing insidiously leaking out from under the door i check outside room the noise alludes me nothing here either above me i hear the ac unit that power the nd floor running we recently fixed it perhaps maybe this is the noise i go back downstairs to call the guest give him the update investigate further he answer hello sir i checked the adjacent room to you and i did not hear a noise i tell him after pleasantry are exchanged well there s a noise i can still hear the noise he responds indignant to my accusation that the noise doesn t exist is it a fan or ac sound the hallway ha the ac running at the end of the hall you re in i offer nay nay a fool i wa not that s not it listen you can hear it on the phone the noise is so loud he presumably hold the phone up away from his ear for me to listen better i listen to what sound like a television a news station precisely now it is i who must be perplexed let me come up and check your room i say knowing fully well what will greet me when i arrive i arrive to his room knock painfully on his door and he open it for me i enter you hear it yeah the noise he nod at me or at least i believe he did i wa a little preoccupied looking at the television that wa on in his room playing the news i look to the guest he doesn t strike me a being hard of sight or of being ill in anyway but i don t issue judgement either way i go to the television and turn it off the noise stop he seems shocked wa that where it wa coming from he asks me he dare to ask me oh i respond i wa just turning it off to try and hear the noise better i ll give him an out i ll leave him with his dignity it the most i can do he look around a moment pass well i don t hear it anymore so everything is fine he thanks me i leave i return to the front desk i sigh my bos ha left me slice of garlic bread in the employee fridge following our staff meeting earlier that day i eat slice in a row the night go on quietly
so this is something i just had to share some quick background i m an fdm at a name brand full service property in a downtown location are rate run anywhere between but because it is a slow weekend we were at tonight honestly a great deal at our property so here we go after a decent shift i have my coat on and everything walking out i made the fatal mistake of coming out to the desk to wish na a good night we are training a new na and i witness someone at the desk asking about the walking rate a i said the rate is for reward member worth noting that our brand ha a best price guarantee meaning the rate listed on the site is the best rate and cannot be undercut at the property level the guest is asking about a lower rate trying to get na to agree to a rate the guest claim he get everywhere i join the conversation and assure the guest that there is no rate and make the terrible mistake of saying that the lowest rate ever is for government employee so the we are offering him is a great deal this result in a minute debate in which the guest essentially demand a lower rate he asked for the government rate despite not being a government employee he then ask about corporate rate even though he is not with any of our corporate client he end up taking out a huge wad of cash taking great time to count it on the desk and go on about going somewhere else the final straw wa saying so my reward number mean nothing right are you really not able to help me or do you not want to he finally leaf thank god moral of the story it is literally our job to help you if we say a rate is what it is we are not lying our entire job is helping you and you bring a giant prick will certainly not make me want to change anything i am saying thanks for coming to my ted talk
hi all i had one of those what the fuck else could possibly go wrong day today turn out a lot more thing went wrong but that s a story for another day i work in a luxury boutique resort for a small brand we get a lot of interesting traveler both good and bad today i had a new experience we had a guest arrive who refused to sign the registration card saying his religious belief prevented him from doing so he s part of a group so his room and tax are covered but incidental such a room service the spa etc were his own responsibility and those slip need to be signed he also said he won t sign any of those ticket i m the fo so i said we will mark the room a no post if he refuse to authorize his own charge he loses his mind and walk away without resolution is this a real thing if it is and i m being unnecessarily judgemental i want to know and i ll find a solution with him but i ve never heard this before and my friend google wasn t helpful either sigh any idea
so i made a mistake my old hotel is in shutdown and i ve taken a job a a task force do for a different company i happen to be in town this week and i m still friend with my old coworkers so we go and get dinner and she tell me she need to swing past the hotel to see whether or not the nightime employee are even there these particular employee used to be friend of mine no more after the other night she call me up and tell me they couldn t be found the phone wasn t getting answered and the door were unlocked hotel in shutdown and a handful of their television walked out i decided to take a walk because they live about foot away from me in the same apartment complex i can clearly see both of them through the window playing xbox i figure i ll be nice one last time and i knock on the door and tell them btw they suspect you both of cutting out mid shift be real careful if you keep doing this right now you re being paid to make sure the construction crew didn t prop open door and to watch netflix then i left it wa like pm or so this happened i told my friend i saw nothing and went to bed then i get a message the next day about how they went to the gm claiming my friend sicked me on them and how it wa harassment essentially admitting i caught them red handed i m still contemplating proper vengeance i warned them and they try to turn it against the person that wa doing their job to my knowledge they both were suspended and earned an enemy of me and when i say we used to be friend i mean i bought them a bottle of johnny walker blue on their last birthday i have walked food over there when i knew they were hurting i ve driven them to the grocery store when they didn t know if they had enough gas i understand the impulse to skip out early when there s no work but dammit don t you dare try and turn that back around on someone i care for
howdy reddit i wanted to share something that happened to me a few weekend ago and that i couldn t get out of my head because of how stupid it wa for this story it is important for you to know that there is a small foyer with a wardrobe at my workplace right before the main area where people sit and eat the restaurant is mainly bottom to top window but the foyer is sectioned off by actual wall so you can barely figure out what s going on in there if no one is actively looking oh and we have a disclaimer written on a sign at the wardrobe that our restaurant is not liable for stolen item see were this is going cue a family of four a few weekend ago mother father two son not necessarily friendly when we greet them but not obnoxious or rude either yet they are seated at a nice window place close to my section so i don t serve them but can see what s going on and what they re doing not much of note happens during their stay except that they are being increasingly rude and demanding to my colleague who s serving their table without her having done anything wrong on one occasion they complained about their food being too cold even though it wa still effing steaming another time they call me over from my section all the way across the restaurant for another order of drink because supposedly my colleague wa ignoring them i saw her come by the table to ask for refill literally two minute earlier we have these obnoxious type from time to time and they are the worst especially when the child take after their parent and behave the same disrespectful way some other minor thing come up the whole family give u death stare for their entire stay and leaf no tip on a bill they pack up their thing and leave to hopefully never return to our restaurant except they do one minute later this is were i get to experience these people in all their glory the mother storm back in through the foyer the older son in tow i worked the section next to the foyer but it wa quite a busy day so naturally i didn t have my eye on the wardrobe all the time mother our umbrella is missing me excuse me mother my son s umbrella is missing and i know someone stole it i want you to take care of it immediately me i m sorry someone took your son s umbrella most likely someone else mistook it for their own that happens from time to time there is not much i can do about it at the moment maybe someone mother i don t care we want the umbrella back it wa your responsibility to keep an eye on it so you need to fix this right now me again i m sorry but our restaurant is not liable for the wardrobe and there is a big sign that state the same right at the entrance of the foyer sometimes thing get mixed up and people bring in item they accidentally took with them a few day later the same could have happened with your umbrella now if you ll excuse me i have a few table to tend to you are more than welcome to check if someone brought back your umbrella in a day or two mother muttering to her son yeah whatever i race back to my table because i ve been held up for way too long take a few order bring out some drink and so on and forth to people when i notice that the mother is still standing at the entrance after five minute brooding so i head back because quite frankly she s blocking the entrance and i just want the have her out of my face at this point me excuse me but is there anything else i can you with because if not then mother i m taking another umbrella me uuuuh what my genuine reaction mother since my son s umbrella wa stolen i m going to take another one with me he can t go to school without it me madam you can t do that mother oh i can we came here with an umbrella and we are leaving with an umbrella she then hand me an umbrella out of nowhere and give me a demanding stare mother go ask your guest if this is their s if nobody say yes we are taking it me you want me to ask every single table in the restaurant if that is their umbrella mother i don t see why that s a problem me your umbrella wa stolen and you want me assist you in stealing another one in return that s hardly legal mother i didn t say anything about stealing this is compensation and my son need his umbrella me madam i won t help you take someone else s property i m sorry you are missing an umbrella but there is nothing i can do for you you are free to check in a few day if someone returned the umbrella but besides that nothing can be done have a nice weekend she try to protest see my manager approaching and just tell me you can bet i will be back on monday with her son in tow who start to throw a fit about his umbrella while they leave i check that they don t help themselves at wardrobe with yet another umbrella and return the one umbrella she audaciously demand a compensation i share the story with my manager we have a good laugh and wonder if that woman will ever return she did not come back for her umbrella but an umbrella looking suspiciously similar to the one she tried to steal wa returned to u on thursday the week after i wonder who could possibly miss it tl dr mother try to recruit me to help steal an umbrella after hers got stolen from our wardrobe

i work in a small restaurant that although it s more high end it s not to the fine dining degree tonight wa a slower night so service wa super smooth near the end of my shift i have the dis pleasure of serving an older gentleman and his friend and aside from some dietary restriction it s pretty uneventful they finish their main i clear amp wipe the table and drop off a dessert menu they re chatting away so i leave them for a while there s no rush tonight and i can keep busy with sidework any way i stop by to check on them and see if any dessert have caught their attention this wa my mistake apparently because the older gentleman decides it s his opportunity to go on a condescending tangent it s all about how he teach at the nearby college in the culinary program that s on par with michelin star restaurant um cool i don t care then going on to nitpick i e how i shouldn t be filling the water glass that it should only ever be to half and how dare i ask about dessert and coffee while he is still enjoying his wine there are only a few sip left by the way rather i shouldn t even be asking about coffee because dessert come first oh how european dining custom are a dying art i just bit my tongue and bore it at the time i have never had a complaint about my service quite the opposite firstly we re not in europe we are not fine dining and definitely not michelin star level secondly my bos is very clear on thing like keeping water full the general pacing etc so i m going to go ahead and listen to him by the way your friend wa only drinking water so sorry for keeping him happy thirdly teach all you want but theory only go so far when dealing with actual people what am i supposed to start telling table sorry no can do that s not proper etiquette no i m going to adjust to their need because them being happy is more important the tip at the end of all this
this might be a general thing amongst all work place i wouldn t know since the restaurant im at is only my second job my first ever manger wa very nice always giving positive feedback a well a always willing to help the manager at my restaurant do not give feedback unless it s something they want you to work on be better at honestly it make me not care for what they have to say a they only seem to see the bad is this common at restaurant or are most manger everywhere like this

last night this woman came into eat by herself and sat herself at a large table despite her being a single diner i didn t say anything despite being a bit annoyed but we were not busy so it wa okay she told me that all she wanted wa soup and wifi a her phone wa not working and she could only make call and text on wifi i got her the password and soup and this is when everything started she told me that her house had burnt down to the ground a few night prior so she wa staying at a hotel on top of loosing all her stuff to fire she had a phone that wa not working and wa trying to get on the phone with verizon to buy a new one i sat down with her for minute going through verizon s website and helping her buy a new phone during my time sitting with her she told me all about how sad she wa to loose her house and how her cat is in the pet hospital because of the smoke she also said that she had just come back from cabo and had a parasite which wa making her experience all sort of wild side effect overall i could tell she wa going through it so i spent a lot of time being someone for her to talk to she wa there for about and a half hour dealing with her phone stuff and making some phone call which normally would have annoyed me but because i spent the time listening to her story i wa very sympathetic when she wa leaving she gave me a big hug and told me how much it meant to her that i spent all this time listening to her and helping her get a new phone her bill wa like and she ended up tipping on top of that this just taught me that all customer have something going on so when people are really bothering me asking for a bunch of stuff instead of being short i need to be more patient

this just happened and it made me laugh so i felt i d tell a few people about it i work at a pet friendly hotel and of course with that there are rule that must be followed such a they must be kept on a leash at all time outside of their room so there is this guest that ha been staying at the hotel for year and never ha he ever kept his dog on a leash he had been told every time but still refused to do so leading him to be finally blacklisted from being able to stay here the last time he tried to stay i wa the agent in charge and wa the one who had to tell him that he wa no longer able to stay here and of course he wa very unhappy about it and i had to nearly escort him off the property month went by and we hadn t heard from him until today when he walk in dog not on his leash behind him and asked do you know who i am which i replied yes i do and unfortunately sir you have been blacklisted and i will not be able to rent you a room which he replied i know i remember you you treated me and my dog like trash i just wanted to let you know that you are an hole and then got in his car and left so basically he knew that he couldn t stay and he just wanted to come in here with the hope that i d be working just to call me an hole and that made me feel pretty special i told me manager about it and we laugh for a good long while about it thank you all for listening

hello all welp one of our night auditor moved on from the business leaving yours truly to cover the audit till our new hire is trained this mean i can share wonderful story again and boy did i get a wonderful welcome back present below is the actual transcript from a complaint that came through corporate today i wasn t here when any of this went down and i ve added my own commentary at point but snuggle up grab some popcorn and enjoy this doozy of a review context i work at a larger hotel in a downtown metropolitan area near a stadium that host an xfl team ahem your pm check in policy is stupid how s that for an opening line if i show up two hour early and let the front desk know i m there i should be in that room within minute omg lol house keeping isn t done with your room is a stupid excuse for making me sit in a hotel lobby for a couple hour your hotel will be the only one in stay that didn t get my room ready in minute your employee are lame ouch oof owie i ve got somewhere to be at and won t be back to the hotel for five hour why won t they get my room ready what is wrong with this hotel management there is no excuse this is unacceptable you have a golden opportunity here convince me to use any lt brand gt related hotel again go ahead do something to compensate for this poor performance nah i ll pas on that one pal after reading the rest of this rant the internet is full of better option and at a better price in my last hotel stay if i arrive after am and tell the front desk that i want to go into my room i have always been treated with respect which translates into my room being ready for me in le than minute again lol always that s professional behavior that s what i expected from lt brand gt hotel i didn t get that from two attendant at the lt hotel name gt i got lazy this included a lame excuse about not having all of their house cleaning people at work that day in fairness we had six calloffs today and our housekeeper had room each but please keep going i said that i d like them to put a fire into house keeping because i wanted to get into my room now there wa one bright person at the desk coincidentally the only white dude odd and he got on the radio and called someone and asked that they get my room ready then he left for the day and what remained were two lazy people of color who didn t seem to care that i wa patiently waiting thirty foot from them asking them every minute if my room wa ready and trying to engage into their brain the idea that it would be professional courtesy to give the customer what he want but no lazy is a lazy doe and i wa forced to leave before i could get into my room then the situation at the lt hotel name gt got worse after attending a football game i came back to the hotel to discover that i wasn t allowed to use my cell phone a a room key the lt brand reward gt app wouldn t let me use it yes you re an entry level reward member and we have to activate it at the desk but you weren t patient enough for that were you i went to the front desk put my luggage ticket on the counter slammed it and said shouted that i wanted my luggage i also said the lt brand gt app wouldn t let me use my cell phone a a room key this is where the desk attendant went from being lazy to being stupid they gave me room key oh look you have your room that were three floor down from the room i had reserved through lt brand reward program gt yeah because we put a rush on a room and checked you into it while you were gone to make your arrival when you came back easier i pointed this out but they still couldn t figure out how to get me a room you have your room or how to make my cell phone into a room key i felt like i had to take a shower because the stupid wa so prevalent i just couldn t stay at that hotel with lazy and stupid people so for the first time in my life i walked away from a hotel reservation not caring that i d lose whatever lt brand gt will charge me for not getting my room i said that i wa done i wasn t staying at this hotel i couldn t stand the situation i wa visibly upset and i even referred to the situation a shitty because that s what lazy and stupid smell like when they occupy service position in reality you verbally assaulted our front desk agent with a volley of expletive when i went to get my luggage i got a nasty comment from one of the stupid people who told you you could go behind the counter because you straight up went behind the front desk while cursing out our employee waltzed into our back office and grabbed your bag someone had to get the luggage it sure wasn t going to get into my hand with those two on duty do whatever you will with my money for nothing the money is not important good then we will gladly keep it asshole my dignity wa offended by professional disrespect lt probably the worst human being ever gt and that my friend concludes this review i ve been at this hotel for the better part of a decade and this definitely rank in the top of shittiest human we ve had in our building list i sure hope he call back to dispute his cancellation charge mostly because it wa an advance purchase through schmooking com love y all be kind to one another

obligatory sorry for format on mobile i had an older couple at one of my table a few week ago the woman wa very polite but her husband wa a real piece of work rude from the start never said please or thank you you all know the type he ordered a pasta dish from our menu that wa a mix of spaghetti noodle and veggie noodle with chicken and a light sauce it very clearly state in the description that both veggie noodle and real pasta are in the dish when i brought it out he looked at it and said it wasn t what he ordered it wa meant to be all veggie noodle i told him that that s how the dish is prepared but i wa happy to have it remade with veggie noodle only my restaurant really push that we d rather remake it to the guest s satisfaction than take it off the bill he said no i asked if he wa sure his wife interjected saying that he wa diabetic and wouldn t eat the noodle i offered again to have it remade especially since it wa for a medical reason he again declined saying he didn t want me taking the dish to the kitchen have the cook man handle the chicken and put it on the new pasta i told him that wa not procedure and that when we make a new dish we remake all of it and would never reuse part of the old one at this point he turned to me and very loudly and aggressively asked wa it the n or the o i can t even begin to tell you how that condescending bullshit made me feel i mean he had a medical issue with the dish and i wa just doing my job and trying to help i couldn t believe he d spoken to me that way i walked away from the table without a word told my manger and he finished the table for me so i didn t have to go back over the rudeness of customer just boggles me sometimes
i work for an global chain hotel shmilton brand had a guest come to put a cash payment on his room this morning i told him it would be xx and he wa really irritated and said the guy last night said it wa xx didn t look at his profile until after i told him state and occupancy tax wa not included in the rate he is canadian and merica doe not advertise price with after tax cost because you should be able to configure our terrible tax gimmick on your own my area is added tax for hotel split between city occupancy and state sale tax is
last night i carried over a tray with large margarita and tall beer not the heaviest tray but a little precariously balanced i lifted off the first beer adjusted my hand beneath the tray to keep it balanced a one doe then before i could set the beer down one of the men at the table start reaching for my tray vision of margarita spilled all over my chest again danced in my head and i quickly told him nonononono a i leaned away before he could grab anything now typically if something like that happened i d gently explain that drink tray are carefully balanced and just grabbing stuff off it can cause it to tip but he didn t speak english and my spanish is terrible and his son kept talking to him so i didn t get to explain why i essentially shouted at him but seriously dude you can t wait second for me to pas out the drink
and then leaf no cash my last table and one of the largest of my check on the last day of my work week and a rather taxing week at that thanks for playing me out on an utterly brilliant note lady apology i really did plan on making my first post here far more witty and engaging but guest have chipped away at my mind and my soul and i m in post work decompression mode read huddled and drinking at an industry bar
this happened a couple day ago and reminds me that although the night audit shift is generally pretty chill sometimes thing can go horrifically wrong through no fault of your own partway through friday night i got a guy at the front desk asking for a key to his room he gave the correct room number and name on the reservation so i gave him a card he came back down telling me his door wa bolted shut and asking me to call the room i did so only for the person in the room to answer and hang up after a couple ring i tried calling again but no answer so for the past week we had this stock show in town and there were people from all over there the group this guest and the others in his room were a part of wa a team of judge or something from minnesota and they were planning on leaving the next day i m not sure how old they were but i m guessing late teen early twenty and a few of them went out that night and it sound like the girl got a little drunk shut the door deadbolted it and passed out leaving the guy out to dry apparently unfortunately i had no way of getting in the deadbolted room and neither did my security guy so there wasn t much we could do the guy that needed to get in there didn t ask u for help for a while after that and i m not sure where he went one of the other room perhaps however like i said the group wa planning on leaving the coach came down checked out and the rest of the group started coming down unfortunately there wa no sign of the girl from the deadbolted room the coach went up there couldn t get in and got no response from the girl i got notified and then continued to try and get ahold of the room to no avail i even basically tried calling the room hanging it up and redialing several time without putting the receiver down but still got no answer it seemed the girl were out cold after that we kept trying to get into the room somehow i call my gm he doesn t have a way in supposedly i tried getting a hold of maintenance they didn t have a way i got into contact with some of the housekeeper there s apparently a key to get in those kind of door but it wa in the housekeeping office which of course wa locked with no way to get in the team wa supposed to leave at am i got off at am and they were still there there wa nothing i could do other than notify the girl who came in after me and sympathize with the coach after i apologized he assured me that it wasn t our fault once i jokingly asked if he wanted to just leave them behind and he said he wa considering just making sure they were okay and then leaving them to find their own way back home i guess that meant they were all at least eighteen i wasn t there for the resolution but i did hear from my security guy and the gm that apparently the girl ended up finally waking up i m not sure how long that took though hopefully not too long at least the coach wa cool about it the gm also assured me there wasn t really anything i could have done when i saw him after starting my next shift moral of the story for kid on any sort of team don t get drunk and pas out just a couple hour before you re supposed to leave and definitely don t deadbolt your door or silence your room s phone your coach and fellow student will hate you tl dr team leaf hour late after a couple girl on it pas out drunk and deadbolt their room
we are in the kid hockey season and we ve had some doozies for team one of my favorite from this year ha to be when someone left their door wide open all day i wa the supervisor on duty one saturday night and we had a particularly bad batch of team in house i wa doing regular floor check because the little sh t kept running up and down the hall and i came across a room on the th floor with their door wide open not propped open on the latch but completely open i think they wedged a t shirt on the floor to keep it open i walked by it a couple time and didn t close it thinking they might be right back but by pm i closed it and came back to the desk a lady came down and said she needed a new key because i think security closed my door i piped up and said no i closed it because keeping it open is a safety concern she looked at me and wa like well that wasn t your decision to make i kept it open on purpose so i explained again about safety and that we wouldn t want your thing to get stolen lady i always keep my door open i don t lock my house i leave the key in the truck so that wasn t your choice to make i didn t argue any further have fun getting robbed next time

so i come in tonight for work it s my th day and i ve never closed before the owner left me and a trainee to close by ourselves he s only been here for le than a week a well i m a good server but it wa so embarrassing tonight telling multiple table i don t know about half of their question there s nobody to ask i accidentally over charged someone a dollar and couldn t figure how to fix it in the system and it wa one of the most awkward encounter i ve ever had i ve been second guessing this job for a bit they make u carry our own change super weird like who want to carry an extra everyday and we owe the house if we are short not really a problem for me but my first day i owed out of my own money and all my cash payment were exact change it wasn t possible for me to be short the closing list wa atrocious a well there wa probably thing to do most very time consuming and we have to cleaning the restroom i just can t believe they would allow two people who haven t even worked a full week close the restaurant sorry for going on a rant tonight wa just super overwhelming i m honestly reconsidering this job
fellow night auditor this one s for you i work at a relatively nice hotel in the downtown area of a college town we have a bit of a homeless problem so we lock our door every night i m always alone on property and sometimes i have to leave the desk specifically every night around the same time i have to go make coffee and help prep for breakfast the kitchen is all the way across our very spacious lobby and of course i can t hear anything when i m in there not the phone ringing not the doorbell nothing i try to make it quick if i still have arrival and i do run back to check the door and the porte cochere every minute but by that point it s early morning and i m starting to assume any remaining arrival will be a no show it irritates me beyond reason when a guest show up while i m gone and is upset with me for making them wait every time this ha happened they exaggerate the time they were waiting when i know it couldn t possibly have been more than minute now i say beyond reason because i know it shouldn t frustrate me so much i understand it s late and they ve likely been travelling for a long time and possibly dealt with delayed flight car trouble or whatever other unexpected travel woe came up during the day they don t want to wait one more minute to take a hot shower and crawl into bed but these people show up at or in the morning with no note in their reservation about their odd arrival time and confirm that no they did not try calling ahead to make sure they could check in but it s still my fault for making them wait a few minute it s just there are so many point during the reservation process when they could have given u an eta even calling an hour beforehand is better than nothing at all i personally always call ahead when i m travelling if i know i ll be arriving at a hotel late it take minute and at work if i know someone is going to be arriving around the time i m supposed to be doing stuff away from the desk it s very simple for me to tweak my routine a bit any other night auditor have this problem or am i just getting worked up over nothing
i served at my old restaurant a a favor the other night for the first time in forever i wa slammed and out of practice so i wa already having a rough night and then with a full section i had this awful top even just greeting them they wanted to order their food and drink at the same time but half of them didn t know what they wanted and they talked over each other and me i wa on the last person she ordered her food and then i asked what she wanted to drink she wa already talking to her friend instead i asked two more time ignored both time before i just got her an iced tea because that s what everybody else got when i came back with the iced tea she got mad and said i never took her drink order i apologized and took the blame and then asked her what she wanted we went back and forth for some time oh i m not a soda drinker i don t like iced tea either is your cranberry juice sweet etc then she look up at me like she just had an epiphany and go what kind of soup do you have i tried to ask her what she wanted to drink two more time before i figured out she wanted her soup a her drink she wa angry that it didn t come out before the appetizer which i had already ordered for them but whatever she got her soup this encounter just felt so bizarre i don t think i ve ever had anybody order soup a their drink in my year of serving even when i worked at a soup restaurant
the policy here with any of the guest story is to believe it firstly no matter how ridiculous it sound so here s this ridiculous story in the afternoon i had offered to help the guest while standing in front of the counter since i wa about to run and do some hotel errand i say to the guest hello sir how can i help you the guest say no not you her i m not in uniform because manager don t have a uniform we just dress in smart casual i just happen to have forgotten my name tag the intern behind the counter is struggling to help him i ask him what s your room number sir in my best customer service voice ever and he stare at me blankly i ask the same question time and the intern asks the same question which he finally replied he wa returning a motorcycle and the intern s lack of english wa making this hard for communication and then i wa like sir i work here i am trying to help you he say prove it me why do you need proof that i work here at this point i honestly started to get frustrated i am clearly trying to help you all this time and you haven t made my life or your life easier i m the assistant manager i just forgot my name tag he i don t believe you me oh for goodness sake sir what is your problem i am literally trying to help make your stay easier and you re just plain out refusing for no valid reason i go into the back office without obstruction and i bring out my manager and just a the guy is walking i say i ve never met a guest who refused help like this he turned back and said yeah so i decided to prove myself to him and gave him a free dinner caveat drink weren t included i made this clear by not writing that drink were included text said i would like you to indulge in a free valentine s day dinner no mention of free drink anywhere i sent him the dinner voucher with an apology letter signed by the gm the gm will back up my as whatever i do our side of the story he thought drink were included at dinner ordered two red wine and then got surprised when he received a bill the family walked out and wa chased at the door of the restaurant and he waved the letter that stated the contrary implying that drink weren t included and the wife paid for the drink in cash i asked the f amp b manager why they just didn t bill it to his room he described them walking out without paying the bill i trust my f amp b manager he s been with u for year all the restaurant staff backed up his claim i only found out after this happened his side of the story mostly bullshit he wa chased to his room by a waitress saying he hadn t paid yet or signed the cheque to allow his room to be charged for the wine and he say that his wife wa pressured to pay and it is absolutely unacceptable to be chased down like this he came to the reception and i just did my usual poker face and adhered to his request i did confirm with f amp b manager that his wife had indeed paid cash and he only had a bill for the previous night s dinner honestly i just wanted to post this because i am so frustrated about how he came up and ruined my colleague day and mine for pretty much no reason other than to maybe get some compensation for the bad behaviour if he ever go on the ota website review and complains about this i will post my response to r quityourbullshit

i just found this sub and i worked a a night auditor many year ago and i have several story from that time so at my old hotel we had a snack closet area next to the front desk for guest to buy stuff instead of having a vending machine the freezer in this snack area wa never filled by management so i usually put my grocery bag frozen dinner in the back of it since i wa the night auditor it wa a hungryman frozen dinner and one night i notice a guest go in there and walk out carrying my grocery bag i meet him at the elevator and politely inform him that he ha my lunch to which he obviously denied it i told him it wa on camera showing him stealing my lunch which it wa he started getting very upset that i wa accusing him and threatened to beat me up i told him he can give me my lunch back or i can have the police remove him from the property it wa then he threw the first punch it wa a bit of a brawl but i managed to knock him out and i put my lunch back and called the cop blah blah blah the cop remove him and his stuff and i ban him from the property and the cop even let me press charge on him for assault that s even funnier because he wa almost a thousand mile from home and had to return to town for the court date then i dropped the charge just because he had to fly back and spend all the money again haha
i m currently working at a pub and have worked a few other full service restaurant but i m looking for a second job and i applied for a banquet server position i m wondering if there are any major difference in the job are the tip better worse any difference in stress level workload appreciate any input
basically tonight something in my brain snapped and wa just like this job isn t fucking worth it i work at a chain motel and the area isn t the worst but it s also just barely one step up from the worst so i ve put up with a lot of bullshit having to go run tweakers off the property get screamed at by drug addict etc etc and occasionally we get guest who aren t the normal clientele and they always compliment me and tell me i should be working somewhere better my family and friend say the same thing and i always blow it off they pay me cent above minimum wage here and job are scarce where i am so it s not ever bothered me too badly and then tonight happens and it s just like the straw that broke the camel back first the emergency alarm start going off in the office and is immediately calling so i answer and i can t tell what room the emergency is coming from and don t really have anything to tell them so they just let me know that someone s on the way and to call back if i find anything out in the meantime so i get off the phone and lock up the cash drawer and go walking around the property to see if i can see anything and immediately i look up and see an african american guy with his hood up trying a key card in several different door like saw him go up to one door try it go to the door next to it try it etc etc so i wa like ah fuck here it is he also had two little girl trailing behind him about year old i go back to the desk and call the non emergency number to let them know a room probably called because of this guy trying to get in so then the guy come down to the lobby screaming even before he stepped foot in the lobby i m super nice and apologetic and trying to work out what s going on but it doesn t matter i m even giving this guy an out like oh if you just forgot your room number we can find it no biggie or whatever nah he s just raging he s got tattoo under both of his eye and a lit blunt in his hand in the lobby with his kid he end up giving me a room number and it s registered to a girl and no one else so i tell him sorry i can t give you a key and he loses his shit the cop end up showing up and he s yelling and cussing so loud in the parking lot with them while the kid are just wandering around the lobby i can hear him start telling the police that i m lying on him and i m a stupid little white bitch that ha it out for him like if anything i tried way too hard to help him only because of the fact that he had young kid with him it wa just a giant shit show the police are back and forth inside asking me question then the guy claim like they always do that he had spoken to out manager so they call my manager and of course she s like nope never talked to the guy period and she wa the only one on shift before i came in just a load of bullshit and at some point he open the door to the lobby and just start staring me down like he s disgusted and want to kill me so i said can i help you with the biggest fake smile i could give and he just smack his teeth and start staring even harder like he want to hurt me then he start cussing and yelling at me again and i m just taking it and he say something along the line of and you re doin too fuxkin much bitch and i said so sweetly no sir i think you are and by then the police were pulling him back out of the lobby it s just not fucking worth it anymore i m tired of this kind of crap every night i m tired of getting yelled and cussed at and called name just because i m following the rule and i m not even the strictest gsr believe it or not i m the most relaxed but no i can t take your food stamp card a a form of id and all of a sudden i m a dumb trash cunt different situation just an example so the police took a little longer with him trying to help him just like i did because he had kid with him but eventually they tell him he just need to leave and they get him out of here and then a few minute later i get a call from a woman screaming and saying our bed have pee all over them and our floor are disgusting and she s calling corporate and she demand to speak to a manager now and i know it s a woman connected to this guy and i just wanted to fucking hang up on her so bad but we re not allowed to we have to take any abuse people throw at u and continue to smile and apologize the whole thing is if the girl who s name wa on the folio wa there i would ve given her a key but instead i got some story about how she s in nevada and instant aggression etc i can t just issue some random person a key and now i m the bad guy he also didn t have any form of idea period and told me his name wa darren but told the police it wa eric idk man idk this place is starting to stretch me too thin

new year eve a night to celebrate and party hard hard enough to have the cop called an hour after checking in these two men came in and rented a hotel room at pm on new year eve they got the most expensive suite in the hotel the presidential suite about ten minute after checking in one of the men from the room walked up to u and informed u that his friend had stole from him and asked u to call the police we asked what he stole he said he stole my crack pipe and shoved it up his as we thought this man wa joking and laughed why would somebody do that well ten minute go by please keep in mind the lobby is full of people we have the ball drop on the t v we left the pool open longer for the kid in house to celebrate the new year there are kid running up and down the hall it wa a good night well my co worker walked past the presidential suite where they were staying and found the man who allegedly stole from the other man sitting outside his door butt naked snorting cocaine off the door guarder and ripping the carpet up in the hallway to get the cocaine he thought wa under the carpet my co worker informed him if he doe not get out of the hotel in ten minute we will be calling the police the man threatened to kill my co worker and told him he will have to kill him to get him out of the hotel so we called the cop the cop came and chased him out of the building into the parking lot the cop were running around trying to tackle him they were shooting him with tasers they shot him with tasers at least ten to twelve time he did not go down the man started to run back into the hotel but he tripped outside the door and crawled in like it wa something from the ring saw my co worker and then started crawling towards him aggressively the cop were outside slipping on snow and ice they couldn t get grip on their foot they finally made it into the lobby before the man got behind the front desk and tackled him they continued to taser him and beat him with night stick he would not stay down it took ten cop to get him down long enough to cuff him this process took them minute during this entire thing the other man who claimed the one on cocaine stole from him wa sitting pretty in the suite also doing cocaine cop went to the room and escorted him out of the building the cop then helped u clean up blood and taser sticker that were all over the hotel lobby and parking lot however we did not go into the room till that following morning we already new the carpet in the hall way wa up from the crazy dude but what we found in the room itself will forever haunt the entire staff there wa blood and feces all over the room there wa cocaine everywhere heroin and meth on table needle and crack pipe they dismantled every single piping system they had access to in the room and tried to use those for crack pipe they took apart the microwave and mini fridge to try and use those for their drug both television in the room were off the wall which were mounted to start with the bedding for all bed and couch were destroyed and in the middle of the room wa the thing that started the entire circus show that wa new year eve a massive piece of feces covered in blood and within the feces wa the crack pipe he really did shove it up his as wa all we could say a we stood in the room and looked at every aspect that wa destroyed we charged them over dollar for the cleaning and damage done to the room a few day later i got a call from the man that wa escorted out of the building he wa asking for a refund of the stay because he did not stay for the whole duration and that he wa kicked off the property for false accusation all i said wa excuse me because i have never heard something so ridiculous in my life he repeated himself and i asked if he remembered anything from that night he told me he didn t remember a thing but know he got escorted out by police for no reason i calmly told him what happened that night and his friend is currently facing five charge against him for the circus show that took place in the hotel he hung up and a few minute later called back freaking out because he saw how much we charged him for everything that happened my manager gave him the picture of what the room looked like the amount of drug in the room a well the one who went full blown crazy though did call back a month later to set up a payment plan to pay back the damage he caused in the room which is issued by the court so he give the court the money and they write u a check and send it to u to this day nothing will ever compare what happened that night i have been a front desk agent for three year and when people ask what it s like to work in a hotel i just sigh and tell them that story there is no way to end this tale to be honest it took ten cop minute to get a man on heroin meth and cocaine in cuff that is all i can think

mom instantly left she came back about minute later asking for a room she wa with a man that wa not her fiance i have never seen this man before at all he wa acting a little weird i asked her who he wa and she said he wa her brother and he is visiting from mexico i of course shook his hand and said hi he acted le weird i asked her why she needed a room because the gm ha to approve of the stay she said her pipe busted from the cold and her house flooded ok good reasoning i texted my gm and told her what happened with her house gm said comp it and let her stay for a long a she need i made the reservation and put the stay in for night she said she only needed it for night after that i gave them the key and told her to let me know if she need help with anything next day i come in for my shift like normal turned out to be a super slow night i got everything done super early i also deep cleaned everything cleaned out nates fish bowl chill night it got to be the end of my night though i wa standing at the computer reading a book and sipping on some juice my my door opened i looked up and a sheriff wa walking in he looked pissed and my as said oh cool a sheriff insert my brain processing oh shit a sheriff that man enjoyed that he started laughing very hard i am glad he enjoyed that most embarrassing moment ever but whatever i asked what wa up and if he wanted coffee he said i am looking for a man i know he is here because he is staying under one of your co worker name and at that moment that man new he struck gold because my eye went wide and my jaw dropped and another sheriff walked in with four cop it took a minute for my brain to process and i looked right at them and said i need a warrant dude they handed me the warrant for an arrest same last name a my co worker i asked how my co worker and the man were involved he said they are brother and sister and he s here visiting from mexico i asked if my co worker will be in trouble she ha kid they said she is the one who told them he wa here and that she won t be in trouble at all because a far a they know she know nothing about the on going investigation against him so i assumed she knew he got into some shit but not how serious of shit he got into i told them i made the reservation and checked the room in they asked what room number i pulled the reservation up and it wa no longer in my system i told them somebody checked him out today it look like and i pulled up the record on that reservation and it showed he shortened the stay and left two hour after check out time so they were about ten hour too late in catching him they asked to see the room i told them it will be useless to see it because he checked out and it ll be empty they still asked to see it so i took them to the room and they went cop mode like they wouldn t let me walk ahead of them somebody wa behind me at all time four of them went and searched the other floor i opened the door to the room and one of them pushed me against the door he had his gun in one hand his free arm shielding me the other cop stormed the room with his gun out a well they were yelling and giving order like i told them before nobody wa in there and nobody wa in there still we all left the room they continued to search the hotel along with the outside i gave them all the information they needed or i could give and they left two sheriff car stayed outside for the rest of the night though watching the hotel i called my manager right after they left and told them what just happened they started freaking out my gm sounded heartbroken and wa more upset that the housekeeper lied to her and i thought yeah be mad she lied about busted pipe it s not like she hid a wanted fucking man in the hotel like come on dude i wa on the phone with them for thirty minute arguing about whether to tell my night auditor or not i didn t want to tell him at all he is a gossiper and we have had huge issue with him starting drama and spreading rumor which cause fight with everybody we didn t want to tell him about this because he will tell everybody and a far a we know this stay between me the manager and the housekeeper they decided to tell him though because in case they came in and questioned him too they wanted to have him aware they gave him a brief description of what happened we asked if he knew anything and he said no so they wouldn t be asking him anything further then that they also told him if he gossip it will be a write up he kept his mouth shut the next day i come into work i asked my manager if they talked to the housekeeper they said yes i asked if she wa ok she said she isn t ok and she understands why she hid a wanted man in the hotel wish she didn t do it but she understands he apparently did some very bad thing she wouldn t tell me i expected her not to not my business my manager told me to pretend like nothing happened and that to just smile at her and make her laugh if i can so i did i continue to smile and make her laugh because i have no idea what happened to him and if she really is ok nobody talk about what happened and nobody know what happened that night besides me the manager and the housekeeper
i just found this sub and i worked a a night auditor many year ago and i have several story from that time late at night is always get people coming in late at night expecting to find cheap deal i could only give a max of off in the system for anyone so i always have really high price then gave them regular price to seem like it wa a deal anyway i man pulled up and came in asking for the cheapest deal i had and after telling him my normal high price then telling him the best i can do is the actual regular price his exact word so if i send my daughter out back with you how much will you take off the rate i politely told him that is not something to say and he awkwardly laughed it off and said he wanted a room so i start the reservation for check in and he motioned out to his car and his wife and daughter get out and come in to the lobby his fucking daughter wa not even a teenager she wa at most when they came in and i saw how old she wa i pointed out again that his joke even if you can call it that wa not acceptable to be telling people his wife then jumped his case apparently he s made these joke before and his wife knew exactly what i wa talking about and ripped him a new one
i m stuck with the night audit shift for the entire holiday season that s fine with me i really don t mind it give me more story to tell here s my tale for christmas eve morning in walk a sixty something lady with no luggage and no car but dressed like she just came from a holiday party she seemed nice enough and we will take any revenue we can get right now so i gave her a decent room at a decent rate and comped her breakfast her card cleared so all is well no red flag she checked in around midnight then came back to the desk three hour later asking what time it is she said that she wa done sleeping and she wa just going to wait in the lobby until breakfast started that s fine by me she sat in one of our lobby couch reading her bible then she asked if i wa married i told her i wasn t she said she would marry me she explained that there wa a very nice doctor that she wa going to marry but he didn t show up on her birthday so she would just marry me instead and everything will be fine she ll never have to be alone on her birthday again i wa a little weirded out by the whole thing but she wasn t really doing anything wrong so i just let her awkwardly hang out in the lobby for an hour she proposed to me twice more in that time then she went outside and got into the taxi that is always parked in front i wa worried about her safety so when the taxi driver returned i asked if she had made it somewhere safe he said that the first address he went to wa under a freeway overpass in a not so safe part of town he didn t want to let her out there and asked if there wa somewhere else she could go he ended up dropping her off at a church and her card cleared for that ride too i just hope that she is okay during that three hour window while my fiance wa fast asleep a homeless man came on property and mumbled something about meeting some friend and asking where the restroom wa i don t always let mumbling homeless people use the restroom it s the same one that i use after all but it s christmas eve he finished in the restroom and helped himself to some of our complimentary ice water i wa thinking of saying something to him but before i could he came to the desk and put on the counter and thanked me for the hospitality and for working on a holiday wow i wa blown away he fell asleep on the bench in the carport which is usually one of my pet peeve but i asked my security guard to leave him alone for a while because the holiday spirit wa moving in me he slept for about an hour and while he wa sleeping i made up a little goodie bag with some of the complimentary grooming item we have comb razor toothbrush toothpaste and some bottled water when he woke up i gave him the bag and wished him a merry christmas now i only have two hour to go
let me preface this by saying i m a bar manager of a small bar that ha live music every weekend i mostly just bartend since we don t have many employee but i can pull out the manager card when i need to some people don t believe that i m the manager since i look really young but i do what i have to in order to keep the bar running smoothly sorry that this got long i wa working on saturday night with one other bartender and no bar back since ours recently fell off a ladder and broke his leg it wa super busy and people were being semi rude all night but it wa nothing too bad some lady freaked out over u losing all of our salt shaker so she couldn t take her patron shot with salt one guy said i don t know why you think she s fat to his friend a i walked by and just a bunch of people banging their glass on the bar when they needed a refill even though both bartender were clearly busy making other drink just an average day at the end of the night after the band wa done some people asked u to turn on the jukebox and so we did and we turned it up loud enough for people to dance to but still not too loud that people couldn t easily be heard over it a lady complained it wa too quiet but i let her know that after a certain time of night we don t like to be too loud since we are attached to a hotel and guest have complained before she didn t like my answer but she left to go back to her friend anyways cue to and i turned the jukebox down to call last call and then i kept it at a low volume to start alerting people it wa time to leave the same lady who complained before came storming up to the bar and screamed at me that she heard me say i hated this song and that s why i turned off her music i explained to her that i never said anything like that a i wa busy helping customer and that i didn t even turn her song off i just lowered the volume of it but she wa hearing none of that she continued to scream at me about the jukebox and how we are horrible server and she ha never been treated so poorly in her life at this point a customer came to my defense and said he wa the one who said he didn t like her song but i had nothing to do with it safe to say she didn t believe him and continued to yell about how much money she spends here and how she s going to talk to my manager about this she s never been treated so poorly in her life blah blah blah now i would like to mention at this point that i ve worked at this bar for year and managed it for year and i have never seen her before in fact i saw her group walk in at am and i didn t see a single one of them come up to the bar to even order a drink all night so i don t know why she kept saying she spends so much money here when i m pretty sure the only money she spent wa on the jukebox i reiterated how i am sorry she is so mad about the jukebox but again i do this every weekend and it wasn t just her song that i had a problem with i even liked the song she played but that s beside the point if she is so dissatisfied with the service then she can leave she again asks for my name so she can report me in the most condescending tone i ve ever heard and i let her know i m the manager and i can take her complaint and she lost it all over again she kept claiming she know the manager and i m not her and blah blah blah and how she s going to go to the owner now instead since i wa clearly lying to her okay do that but she just wouldn t stop talking so i lost in for a split second and just yelled get the fuck out if you dont like it leave she kind of startled at that and then tried to start complaining again so i yelled again get out before she finally got the hint and left the whole bar wa pretty silent after that but no one else complained it probably wasn t the best way to handle the situation but she wouldn t let me get a word in edgewise and she didn t believe anything i said anyways it had been a long night and i wa just very over it by the time she came up to the bar she never did contact the bar owner
i should start of saying i fucking hate ranch so maybe i don t get it but one of our foh manager wa berated for u not having it not gee i sure wish you had ranch here but full on berated it s not even her fault i honestly don t know why we don t have it given a many request we get for it but that s up to the kitchen manager fucking people and their goddamn ranch
get to work around and the manager and a few very of the most elite trainer are having a meeting in an area that server wouldn t overhear i headed back to where we put our bag eat drink coffee etc there s a server we ll call her amanda who think she is the shit i ve talked to one of the manger about amanda before and the manager say it seems that amanda feel attacked when there are new server i wa on a food running shift tonight traying up and running food i wa irritated that her wing an appetizer that should take minute wa going on kept yelling at the kitchen especially when they put empty basket a if they were sold but forgot to bump it so i had the sauce grabbed the wing and out of nowhere amanda push through people and yell at me this tray doesn t get hot sauce well you rang it in a a side which everyone can see on the ticket this wa after being told it s more important to run and this will give away where i work but whatever our free fry refill to keep people happy god damn if i just ran fry food would never go out ever every damn table get fry before their meal and usually more friend that s about table constantly wanting fry plus the bar so that s when i just lost it started sobbing and sat down in the server s area i wa fine within minute but i m not thrilled to go in tomorrow and do the same thing edit i did talk to a manager and that meeting wa mostly about this happening to other server being bossed around by people like amanda and being unable to do their job or told wrong thing so this is a real issue here i mentioned a few other name doing similar thing and the manger said yep they re on the list it s a known issue doesn t mean i didn t want to cry any le i actually just wanted to leave at least i m tipped out for this
denial
we had a person call our restaurant who wanted to make reservation for him and his wife no problem he proceeds to ask question about the food and want to know if we can do anything special for them our chef love what he doe and accommodates guest almost every time so we tell him what we can do we hang up and he call back to ask if we have anniversary card we tell him we don t but again we could see what we could do we re lucky enough to have a boutique by our establishment that sell card so we purchase one he then call back and asks if we are able to get the card we say yes and then he asks if he can email u what to write on the card we say okay he then email u a long email talking about how he s messed up their relationship so many time and he s sorry he will do better he love her so much etc it wa awkward for u and the card wa very personal so we ve prepped some extra food for their dining experience set the table and add a little bouquet of flower and the card he call minute before their reservation and say he s not coming we have a good laugh at this now a it wa a memorable guest experience for our small restaurant
so i recently got a job at a local brewery for the most part this job wa let say decent they were basically a star restaurant posing a a star they wanted the waiter to memorize the ingredient of all the food off duty memorize the beermaking process despite literally nobody asking about that they had test you had to take after a while or they d withhold your tip despite all that of the staff were decent human being except for one jeff first a little context they claimed that they d give you day of training before putting you on the floor theoretically you d be paid a decent wage during that time except for the fact that once you started actually working the floor they just combined your untipped wage with your tipped wage so you re basically working for four day at an hour without tip still you need to train i get it day the restaurant is swamped with customer and they have only one server in the front i spend the whole day running dish day amp actual training day really day they get swamped again and they decide enough is enough and give me table day introducing jeff note that at this point i should only be on my first day actually being a server with extra day of training under my belt he introduces himself by asking me if i d been telling the truth about being a waiter before a it certainly didn t look like it talk about an introduction i wa busy so i didn t have time to respond but this set the tone for our subsequent meeting now we re going into the holiday season so thing are very busy and i m working full time and while everyone else is supportive and encouraging jeff find it utterly impossible to say anything in a positive way i d forget a soup spoon and he d make it out to be the literal work of satan meanwhile the kitchen is consistently sending the soup out at degree and the dishwashing staff are leaving or tub of dish in a line forcing the waiter to basically do everything but throw the dish into the dishwasher for them this culminates in probably the worst day of my life i m extremely sick to the point where talking or moving make me miserable but i don t want to leave them shortstaffed so i mention in passing to a different manager that if someone else wanted my shift i d be happy to let them have it if they wanted some extra cash mid shift i have a rare minute where we re caught up and one of the other server check our respective take and find that mine is a full higher than either of theirs so i offer one of my table that i d already seated and taken their order to the waiter with the lowest take which he happily accepts about an hour later this phenominal douche ha the gall to come up to me and tell me that i wasn t pulling my weight because he heard i wa asking to take it easy and have le table he follows this up by saying that since i wasn t pulling my weight remember he wa going to have me switched to being a busser after the holiday crunch wa done and he still didn t believe i wa telling the truth about being a waiter previously seriously i very nearly blew up right then and there but i wa tired and sick and didn t have the energy to deal with his bullshit so i kept on going hit the end of my shift folded every bit of silverware i knew to find and asked a different shift manager if i could leave and he said yes i clock out and this absolute assclown come up to me and say he didn t give me permission to leave he sends me back to start folding more silverware off the shift using the crappy stuff they keep for the waitstaff not only that but he said that i wa going to have a test on the ingredient the next day despite having barely worked there for two week and the official policy being you were tested after a month i wa raised not to be rude but that night wa the angriest the darkest i ve ever felt in my life i wrote some very dark thing when i finally got home i knew i couldn t hurt him in any meaningful way nobody would take the word of a new employee over an established manager and i didn t want to overly burden my actually good coworkers but at this point i have nothing left to lose if i m going to lose my job anyway i ll do it on my term so the next day i went to the office told them i wa going to work one more day told them everything about the shitty manager that my leaving wa his fault and everyone else wa good that last day i worked my as off i worked harder than any two other employee combined i gave one of my most helpful coworkers a chunk of my tip from the previous day a thanks and i left with my head held high i dunno maybe it didn t hurt him at all but even little thing can stack up and i hope that someday when his career come crashing down it wa my straw that broke the camel s back
so i used to work front desk at a major hotel chain i would start at am and assign housekeeping duty a well a checkout complaint and what not so this one morning i m at the front desk processing some checkout and have a small line forming so i m trying to move quickly a i work alone all of a sudden the door to the stair well whip open and this man come flying into the lobby completely naked except for one of those tiny little hotel towel around his waist myself and the lobby full of guest are stunned he come right up to the front desk butting in front of the whole line very flustered and angry he s like i ve been locked out of my room i need a key to get back in so i ask what room and verify the detail on his file and make a new key card for him a quickly a i can the whole time i m thinking maybe his gf locked him out of the room or something so i just let it go and move on to checking out my guest about minute later the man come back fully dressed talking about how someone snuck in his room last night and moved him to a different room he say he s running for mayor and this is a blatant attack on him they must have been trying to plant hooker on him it a conspiracy all this absolutely insane stuff the whole time i m thinking suuuuuuuuurrrre buddy must be some good drug so he s like come with me i can prove it he take me up and show me his room that assigned to him all of his stuff is in there but the bed is fully made and not slept in then he say follow me brings me to the room next door that is completely empty except the bed ha been slept in he tell me this is the room i woke up in completely naked so i go check the computer and sure enough the room he woke up in wa not assigned to anyone at this point i m confused and assure him we would not have provided anyone with key to his room or anything of the sort i call my bos and explain this crazy story and she say she will check the camera when she come in turn out the guy wa wasted and walked out of the room naked in the middle of the night stumbling down the hall one of the cleaner forgot to completely close the door and he happened to push it open and fall asleep in there mystery solved just some crazy nut job so a few day later i m driving and i see this truck with an advertisement and picture of the guy face on it john doe for mayor they guy really wa running for mayor i couldn t believe it that wa not the last i saw of that guy either he wa an absolute nut job who stayed in our hotel often the story about that guy

i work at a star property that aim to host transient business and leisure guest due to the holiday we ve had fairly low occupancy for a few week we have a guest that ha been with u for a week or so she book her room one night at a time each day through a third party she s used a couple of different name and seems slightly rough around the edge but otherwise seems like a decent person a lot of the staff myself included assume that she is probably a sex worker every time she walk by someone inevitably point and whisper she s always been agreeable and nice and she s never done anything to harm our property and sex work is still work i d rather that she be able to stay in a safe space than some other option granted we had another sex worker who wa staying with u month ago that listed our hotel on her site which could devalue and taint the reputation of our hotel but ultimately until we confirm anything i don t entirely see the point of defining her by her potential profession and talking until we find that anything she s doing is actively bad for our hotel but maybe i m being naive i just had some thought that i wanted to express

i originally posted this a a comment but i figured it deserved it own slot since some of the detail started coming back to me beyond the comment thread football weekend can be literal hell the endless string of guest checking into the hotel the constant request and the horde of people lingering in the lobby can make a shift tough especially if you re a college student like me who study during down time back during football season my big ten college wa playing a ncaa division game and the following sunday you d have thought there wa this mass exodus from the premier schmoliday out downtown well most people checked out and were totally okay with their stay then there s the karen this karen came to the desk checked out and when asked about her stay she said it wa great and left this little detail come into play about ten minute later when the phone ring i picked up the phone once it started beeping and did the standard greeting then k is there a manager i can talk to our entire stay wa just awful m recognizing the voice on the other end of the line a the woman i d checked out ten minute before is this lt insert karen s name here gt k yes m i m the one who checked you out and you said your stay wa fine k well our room wasn t cleaned either day and we never got soap for the shower the pool wa simply too cold and the breakfast wa inedible you call this a hotel this is purely unacceptable for a lt corporation name gt brand and m seeing her little scheme for what it wa and looking at the note for her room spoiler two dnd sign did you ever inform the front desk of your concern and from what housekeeping tell me you had the do not disturb sign out both day which is why they didn t clean the room k well no we didn t tell them we didn t want to make a fuss but because of the horrid experience we feel we deserve a full refund and i ll accept nothing le than that two thing one in aviation every aircraft ha a pilot in command and their job is to not cave to bullshit i d been pilot in command of plane for about two year before this so my tolerance for bullshit is extremely low i can usually manage to hide it for the hotel but sometimes it make an appearance two before this phone call i d had a snowflake bitch me out for not giving him free breakfast even though he wa the highest level of snowflake there wa in my brand even though my hotel doesn t do free breakfast unless you pay for it with your rate a such my patience wa just about a nonexistent a it could be it take a lot to get to me but entitlement and lying are the two big one put these two and my aviation training together and you get something like this m you ll have to you never told u about your issue you left the do not disturb sign up both day and you apparently lied and told me your stay wa great we can t read mind it wa your responsibility to tell u of any issue with your stay which you failed to do a such we will not be compensating at this point karen realized her little scheme wasn t going to work she d simply gotten the one desk agent who doesn t cave to bullshit and she didn t like this too much cue the karenisms k what s the number for corporate i can t believe how unprofessional you re being i m going to make sure they hear of your conduct and they re going to fire you what s your name m my name s airbusman have a good day k what about the number for click she tried to call back but unfortunately for her she got my former manager who had even le patience for crap than i did he just hung up on her most of my story have an ending similar to this one but they re very few and far between usually people at least voice their complaint rarely at my location do people not but when they try to pull this crap it wind up here
i saw some similar post to this regarding smoking fee i have a story from my first hotel property about year ago tldr at bottom apology for mobile formatting english is my first language and i am still a sleepy front desk agent long time lurker first time posting it s the dead of winter and i m blending in a a vampire no one ha noticed yet me me yo college student guest and early s girl fdm front desk manager mid s guy very respectful never ever swears any who it s am and my guest want to checkout we shouldn t be charged the full night because it s only am me yeah no that s not how this work unfortunately the room rate is set and checkout time is by am you are still being charged for the full stay besides they were on the first floor just a quick walk to our smoking area shouldn t be an issue imo a they are signing the receipt will we incur a smoking fee even though they didn t smoke in the room giant red flag ha draped over the building me the fee at our non smoking property only go onto receipt if the guest have smoked damaged the room they start yelling at little ol sleepy me at am but we never smoked in the room you need to release their incidental now me it is not up to me to determine what fee they incurred outside the nightly rate with tax but here is my manager card and they can call and leave a voicemail guest leaf and i proceed to hear my manager phone go off every minute for about hour luckily me being that the hotel is sold out and per our superextrashinymemeberperks every member no matter the status get a hand delivered newspaper at our sold out property where all of them are member yay cue squat in front of room to deliver the newspaper receipt i start from the top floor and work my way down like mario my bun of steel are glorious i get to the room they just checked out of and it reek absolutely reek of some really cheap tobacco and possibly weed industrial room spray i can t tell because i m gagging and need to keep going i bring an out of order sign and place it in front of that room so other guest just think it s a room being remodeled i don t have time for this i need to make pot of coffee for our lobby cue the fdm coming in at am he want to know what happened to cause his vm box to be full we start to listen to the voicemail and it s just these girl going off job stop about how we are racist for refusing their refund immediately how could we do this to them they need this money to get home etc etc they were pulling everything from their book of karen to be mad about and to apparently yell about regarding not receiving a full refund of incidental immediately i tell my manager that their room reek when i passed it and we need to inspect it oh and boy wa this a fun inspection you d think we were renovating per our security policy we have an electronic box that will read the door lock to determine who ha opened the specific door our window in these guest room do not open for safety reason just to clarify they can be shoved open for fire emergency and set off alarm but not for just opening them we determine that besides housekeeping cleaning the room yesterday the guest are the only one who have accessed this room we go inside and my fdm immediately start recording on his phone fdm speaking for the video the day and time is current x and x we just entered room that checked out at am noting damage for the room he start listing off damage me and fdm just look at each other and mouth whattheflyingshit they burned cigarette mark into the duvet of the bedroom it reek of smoke and they left their bong in the garbage can we look around confused because of the hole in the wall they took the flat screen tv now mind you you can get a nicer tv from walmart this size for about it is not super nice and is not a large tv at all the damage are well over from what my manager wa stating they broke almost everything expect the light fixture which were the cheapest thing to replace in this room when getting back

tl dr at the bottom i had to type this out for my manager so i just took out any information that would give away my property brand or the third party i had a gentleman call me right before midnight asking for a room i quoted bar to which he said he wa just going to book online because they had a half night rate i responded that i had never heard of that before especially because after midnight all reservation are made for the next day at check in but if they have it feel free to book it if you say this ha worked before just make sure it is for the night of and i told him over the phone i wa skeptical because i had never had a reservation booked that way before he mentioned it ha worked all but once when he got there they did not have his reservation i waited to do my audit until when i ran it there were no arrival left fast forward to am i had a gentleman come in and ask if the ramp wa for additional parking to which i responded yes i had walk in and multiple phone call so i had no way of knowing who this man wa so i asked if he wa already checked in and he said no i asked for his last name there wa no reservation under the last name or the first name he went back out to get the confirmation number from his email he watched me type in the confirmation number and look for his name in arrival no reservation came up but on the email it showed our hotel and arrival of i explained to him unfortunately that i did not have his reservation in our system and that he could call third party or i could get him a room for i had no idea the rate of his third party reservation he went off he did not ask for me to negotiate nothing he stated through his ramblings that i had an attitude from the moment he walked in the door because i knew who he wa i had no way of knowing who this man wa why else would i ask if he is already checked in you probably hate your bos so why doe it even matter all this over ten dollar i already pre paid which i did not know he did not tell me and at this point i still wa just letting him vent but there is chance i could not help this man because i had no cc auth and no reservation i could not let him have a room for free he asked if we were commissioned based to which i responded no and he stated i m not taking money away from you it s getting taken away from your bos so why doe it matter you are losing a customer you probably get people like this all the time but you shouldn t use third party if it doesn t work which is the number booking site so you are losing a ton of business he mentioned on the phone that he had done the late night reservation before and it wasn t at the hotel when he got there but that only happened once out of multiple time of using it he continued but i just listened because at this point i knew there wa nothing i could do because i did not have a cc auth and i knew he wasn t going to pay out of pocket so i told him to have a good night after he wa done and wa walking out of the door i thought of myself a nice the entire exchange or at least i try to be the every shift he wa likely just upset and that why he said i had an attitude anyway he left me pretty shaken up so i went to the back to call night auditor at sister property and ask if i wa in the wrong night auditor at sister property said i wa not and while talking a fax came in at am it wa his cc auth it said it wa sent at am i checked the system and the reservation still did not exist i wouldn t have been able to do a reservation even if the fax had come through with no reservation in the system because all number but that last four on the cc are blurred so i had no way of charging the pre paid third party card all in all i had no way of helping this man mainly because of booking but also because i had no way of helping him without him feeling like i wa charging him twice he asked for my name multiple time so there will probably be a review about me and i m sorry but i did everything i possibly could and staying nice while helping him when i had already had a shit night tl dr man is upset because he booked pre paid after midnight with a third party and i never received his reservation or cc auth and could not help him so i am horrible at customer service
so our year old property is getting a renovation for the first time in year the first step is our year round indoor pool this feature and our large room which are all suite attract a lot of local guest that want to host raging birthday party for year old all day and night friday through sunday anytime something happens that close the pool down we get complaint that this is the only reason this property wa booked and they all want their money back on december st all our website had a notice up about the pool closing for the month of january on december th we put signage up around the hotel at the last front office meeting we discussed how we would make sure everyone knew at check in there wa no pool for the whole month and allow them to cancel without penalty however with all the signage and verbal notice we will not be refunding any portion of a visit for the pool being closed i m taking bet on how many people try to do this on the first full weekend of the closure i checked today of all reservation this weekend that have address or telephone number are for people within mile of the property and because my revenue management team belief a cheap occupied room is better than an unsold room of those local room are family amp friend or employee rate

if this doesn t fit let me know so a guy posted on facebook complaining the local restaurant wa out of these two sandwich how he wa treated poorly and how he will never go back however myself and a few others were there to witness the whole thing go down he ordered a sandwich and when that wa sold out he ordered another sandwich that wa the same thing just made differently a hot roast beef sandwich and a triple which wa rb ham and turkey the roast beef is very popular and he went later in the day he flipped out on the server a year old i mean calling her all kind of name threatening to get her fired etc cop ended up having to escort him out his reply on facebook to all of those supporting the restaurant he s retired military and ha a right to voice his opinion
it s the slow season for most restaurant however we still need to work since most of u our student some have quit already because they were dropped from hour a week to and these are people who have open availability every single day and are cut down to day a week some have been fired because they refuse to change their availability due to prior commitment such a school or kid at home or family commitment or because they can t uphold our company s strict standard some of u like me are going to deal with it in hope of getting better hour when it pick up in the next few month that s the dream i guess i don t want to get a second job since i ll be in school full time again next month but it s looking like i won t have a choice can t wait till i m out of this industry it s helped me with money for year but it s definitely always been tough
i worked this morning and had quite a day a woman came in with her son and sat down on monday wednesday we offer a kid s meal up to four free meal depending on the size of the pizza with a purchase of a pizza we also do a buy one get one bogo half off on pizza like any other store the cheaper pizza is halved also i feel it s logical to understand that you d not get a discounted meal without u getting some sort of sale this particular tale involves this woman who really prof she s the discount queen they started off extremely nice the child wa absolutely adorable and just got back from the dentist she wa a bit indecisive but come on we have a lot of topping to choose from we even have three different sausage how can it be easy to already know what you want so i wa patient with her i guided her through the menu until she wa ready to make her decision i go off to place her order for a large sausage and ground beef pizza a minute later she call me back to the table she asks about the kid s eat free option in which i happily told her i can put it in she then say will i still get my half off pizza okay easy mistake i get it i explain to her that it s bogo i also mentioned that i would not be able to do both discount if she decides to choose the bogo that s where lovely customer becomes entitled woman ew ew i called up here and the employee said i get a discount pizza me we do half off only when you get two pizza the cheaper pizza get half off ew i checked your website and it say i get discounted pizza me if so i can report the misinformation to my gm cue a long awkward pause where i sent a help me face to my manager i m redacting a lot of repetition in this post ew it s not a mistake i called up here i read the website give me my discount me our daily special is buy one get one if you d like i can ask my manager to make sure i m correct oh i know i m correct ew no he need to give me my discount here i ll show you the webpage she proceeds to pull up the website in which the daily special read bogo half off on pizza i understand not many know what bogo mean but i don t get why they ignore that acronym when it clearly mean something her face drop she s backed into the corner i have the higher ground ew well they need to specify it buy one get one me sure i ll let the manager know first thing she change her pizza to a small sausage while her original order wa being thrown in the oven she add a kid s meal to the ticket i halt the order and tell the kitchen that she decided to change her order two minute after they re saucing and cheesing her new pizza i walk away from doing dish to find my customer yet again arguing with another employee the employee wa explaining that she said it wa buy one get one half off i guess we figured out now ew just tuned into what she wanted to hear my coworker tell her about our lunch special we have and asks if she d like to change that i quickly turned around and stopped my manager from putting the sausage on her new pizza i heard my coworker telling her how much cheaper it d be etc so the woman obviously wanted another order made she spent five more minute berating the both of u on how we weren t honest with our special blah blah blah she finally stomped back to her table yay she s done she finally settled on an order but oh wait what if she think she get a free kid meal i rush to the table to let her know the kid s meal doesn t apply to shorten this i did have to argue that the lunch special doe not apply she can either take off the kid s meal or pay for it at least she made it easy and left the kid s meal on there the rest of the visit went on normally i checked on her and she finally settled down i had no issue with her for the rest of the time i guess she learned a valuable lesson today the customer is always right is only a saying to make you feel better about yourself
hey all some folk over at talesfromsecurity told me to repost this over here so i ll sub over here a well and see what you guy have to share anyhow here it go so i finally have a good story to tell in doing hotel security recently i got a call last week that a local hotel needed security they do it on an a needed basis and i guess friday wa pretty rough with a bunch of drunk parent being loud in their lobby they have very clearly documented quiet hour and the owner of that particular site though it s a chain are very strict on their quiet hour i m chilling in the lobby on my computer doing some stuff and the front desk gal come over and say hey we ve got a noise complaint from room ok i hop up and head out to see what s what i get there and i listen for a bit at room yep definitely kid in the room messing around being moderately loud now i don t want to do paperwork so my first step is always knock and talk just a hey guy it quiet hour please keep it down keep me writing just a line in the log versus a whole report well someone open the door i think it wa a girl look at me and slowly close the door without even letting me speak i m like ook and i knock again am ignored ok whatever i go down to the front desk call their room phone no answer i call again phone off the hook ok whatever x they quieted down which is ultimately my goal about minute or so later i see some people at the front desk and i sort of overhear that they are talking about their kid being accused of being loud or whatever the adult were off property the front desk gal said hey we had a complaint i sent security we have quiet hour the guy come over to me semi huffy a if it wa completely impossible that his kid were being loud i told him listen it wa just a courtesy visit we re in quiet hour now we just need them to quiet down so he argues how it wasn t his kid it wa kid in the hall basically saying that i can t tell the difference between loud kid behind a door and kid sitting in a hallway foot away around the corner i try to clarify that this is all completely low key no worry on anything just quiet down and we re good i really didn t want to do a report so his wife come over and enters the bickering and i clearly say listen no one care no one is in trouble i didn t even document anything it wa just a courtesy visit to get the kid to quiet down well the mother responds with well i care and ran off in a huff i really didn t know what they wanted from me at that point an apology well the mother wa so offended that it wa considered that her child were being loud while no adult on property with them mind you that they insisted on leaving the hotel for another i wa at the front desk after taking another walk of the property when they checked out the father go that will be no charge the clerk go um ok the father then demand a receipt for his free stay and this killed me the clerk print up his ledger for dollar i turn to her after they left and i go you didnt refund him did you she say no i just gave him his ledger which he owed dollar on because his room wa already paid for before they arrived i lost it and gave her a nod of approval and then returned to my corner to write a page report that i didn t want to have to do in the first place

i ve never posted before im a huge fan of reddit but i mostly consume content and occasionally add a comment but i ve never been much of a writer so forgive me this wa simply to confusing and baffling to me for me not to share im staying at a hotel and it am i m trying to get the sim card out of my phone so i opt to go to the front desk and simply ask for a paperclip my room is right next to the front desk so it take me only a second to get to it standing there is a pretty young indian woman in a red business suit by her outfit and tight ponytail accompanied by her perfect posture and general aura this woman looked a if she mean business and doesn t tolerate b s i smiled and said hello do you by chance have a paperclip she responded by saying yes please give me one minute and she looked around and found one and i said thank goodness thank you so much now at this point she s pretty far from me and i m leaning against the from desk using the paperclip to pop my sim card out she s standing maybe or foot away because she went towards the back office which is behind the front lobby desk she turn to me and snap dont say that to me i find that derogatory and insulting i quickly responded with wait what what did i say i didnt mean to offend you i m so sorry she looked at me with a i m so much better than you kind of look and she say you said to me bless your heart in the south that s the worst insult you can say to someone your calling me stupid a if i m not smart enough to grab a paperclip i wrote a book so you know maybe you should read it i ll be signing book at barnes and noble soon i couldn t believe my ear first of all i never did say bless your heart but being the christian i am it wouldn t be strange if i did respond to her doing something for me such a getting me the paper clip with a thank you bless your heart i wa so friendly and i wa in no way giving off the vibe to where she would think that i wa being mean so i told her that i m sorry and i never knew it to be something people take offense to because i ve always used it usually when either concerned or th thankful depending on context but she went and printed out the definition from urban dictionary and not the actual definition which is complete opposite and the paper she highlighted along with printing the info to her new book and where to buy it and handed me it a to idk maybe feel like she put me in my place like geez lady i get it your smart and very sensitive about people perceiving youas dumb but i wasn t and the way she treated me wa so mean and nasty when i didnt actually put her down or even say what she thought i did and the paper with the urban dictionary definition say so many bad word i recommend looking it up yourself to see how crazy she wa being to have handed a customer that paper highlighted might i add i m just soooooo confused now
i thought it d be fun to share might not be a fun story rant if anything you might be a frustrated a i wa technically i m front desk since i am part of the front line my official title is a glorified service rep with a lot of designation sort of like operation expert which really mean that you do a lot of stuff outside of your job description without being paid for it quibbling aside i m at my station the first person that customer see when they come in is often me and they tend to make a beeline towards me even if my coworkers greet them or even declaring that they could assist them a customer walk in asian mid s she s been here twice this week alone a i am the only available representative she come to me i recognize her internal moaning you see she s been having problem with her online account for this business but what doe that have to do with you excellent question but corporate ha decided that front line staff should be able to resolve online issue despite u having an online related department coincidentally that department is also another department isn t this company efficient so here s the rundown of the issue standard stuff customer is unable to access her account when at home but is able to within the confines of this business when we had personally reset her password on two occasion this week alone she refuse to call our online support number c but it just stop working when i get home here let me show you the customer attempt to enter her password on her phone it say incorrect me okay i ll go ahead and reset your password so i reset her password and i watch her put in her new password and i tell her do you want a memo maybe if you write it down c no it okay it s a very easy password internal yelling you don t say so before she leaf i make her log back in in front of me surprise she can t log back in it must be your system she had the audacity to say we repeated this step again she couldn t remember what new password she had made i wonder if there s a problem with her account a lock that s there that i don t have authorization to see so i reset the password again i log in on my work computer just in case it work she s just something else so i made her a password with her a password we both know it had character of which were sequential number you would think this is where this adventure end however she exceeded my expectation and wa unable to log in so this is what it s like to be a disappointed father her excuse and blaming our system certainly didn t help maybe i messed up so i try the log in myself on my work computer it work maybe it s her phone i hoped i logged in just fine there isn t a priest in the vicinity to check if her finger are cursed in the kindest customer service voice i tell her that there is nothing wrong with our system nor i and point out the thing that are working in hope that by the process of elimination she figure that maybe it s her maybe that s too much expectation for someone that owns a company she eventually left it wa anticlimactic and i took a sip of my coffee and greeted my next customer

i dunno why but i ve been in a mood where i ve reminisced all of my cringey experience in the industry this particular story place in my top three worst experience i wa a hostess at the time a server working with a party table wa pretty upset with them from what i recall it wa an issue with trying to play spin the wheel of comping a well a oddly needing refill every second on gallon sized drink not to mention that two parent were heavily drinking our big a margarita a they had to take an infant home i m sure the server could tell a better story on that this is my hostess story i wa obligated to clean table after people left and boy oh boy this wa incomparable to any table i ve had to clean clearly the customer did not allow the table to prebus we knew which server actively prebussed or did not this server prebuses so i wa left with a table covered with more plate and bowl than with table not to mention that the chair needed some deep scrubbing at this point i wa stacking the plate immune to any other smell than the smell of salsa and guacamole but something caught the corner of my eye a ginormous brown seeping diaper smack dab where those drunk parent were sitting quickly i grab two rag together tying them into a bandana i wrap it around my nostril to get to work with some napkin i lifted up the diaper hastily disposing of it into the trash can in the woman s restroom by the baby changing station yep two drunk parent decided the best place to change their infant wa in the middle of a busy dining room of a mexican restaurant somehow that will always be worse than cleaning up cocaine in the bathroom
i ve been working in hotel for the past year now and one of the thing that grind my gear is when someone come in without a reservation when we re sold out most people would say okay thanks and be on their way it s the one that are like okay can you call around for me and find a room for me i used to call a couple other one to be nice but after a while i had to tell myself that i m not a concierge and they can do it themselves
the night audit shift started out fairly normal finished my last check in and wa outside speaking to the overnight at the property next door we share a parking lot so we share security duty guy got dropped off by a cab so i went inside to meet them at the desk a they entered i could tell they were hammered one wa barely conscious the other just trying to het his friend to the room well the more plastered of the supposedly had a reservation for my hotel he pull up his phone and show it to me it in the middle of a phone call with i go into instinct and assume this man is in trouble and the guy with him is a problem i repeat the current address loudly so that the operator can hear me i notify the guest that they do not in fact have a reservation he realized at that time that his hotel key wa for a place mile across town the sheriff arrived about minute later turn out the guy wa so shitfaced he didnt even realize he had somehow as dialed ive almost done this before a the lockscreen on my phone ha a slide option for quick emergency call the more sober of the pair who i assumed to be a bad guy freaked out a bit when the cop showed up he seemed very confused and claimed i had called the cop because of his race wild the cop ended up giving them a lift over to the correct hotel and all wa just fine

a long time ago in a hotel far far away i angered the hospitality god and they sought retribution in the form of the world greatest detective from here on out known a detective idiot or di for short di wa like any other guest before the god decided we should share a special moment in hospitality guest relation i did not check him in and he wa just a name and a room number until he needed something because of course he did it started off simple enough di called down to report his light above his bed didn t work i had the misfortune of being maintenance whenever maintenance left for the day and so up i went the light above the bed have their own switch on the side of the unit for convenience sake and indeed this switch did nothing after di and myself both nodded in agreement this wa the case i went to check the breaker to tick all box before asking if di would like to move room a the breaker box wa all fully on and we didn t have replacement bulb for those specific light at the time di did indeed want to move i called down to my coworker and had them prepare the key a di prepared his thing i handed di the key and directed him to his new room down the hall all wa well it wasn t in the time it took me to ride the elevator back down and reassume my position at the desk di had already called down to report we were on working bed light no fucking way i replied to my lovely coworker who wa now laughing a i shook my head and turned around to head back up keep in mind the entirety of both room were fully functional a intended besides these tiny little reading light attached to the bed after i ve entered the room di ha a newfound annoyance in his greeting you know i just i just dont get it how do the rest of the light work and these one don t this time around i did what i should have done the first time remembered i know this property better than the guest after flipping on every light switch huzzah the bed light come on i chuckle quietly and explain to the guest the room have a master switch that allows you to turn specific light off but others are turned on off manually or are attached to the other switch surely di would see it wa just a funny little mishap and the light now work we could both go our seperate way i had just offended his entire bloodline and every moral he had ever held dear in his life by flipping that switch much like an encaged primeate who ha just discovered a new toy fell upon their enclosure di looked upon this supposed master switch with great intrigue after flipping it on and off a few time to see what would happen he decided that he wa not wrong but in fact whoever designed such a contraption and all the employee who were complicit in duping him from basking in the glorious warmth that is the headboard reading light were wrong you see the master switch had to be flipped down to be on and up to be off whenever it wa flipped up a small nightlight would come on to presumably be able to see it in the dark di had deduced that this make no sense and the engineer who designed this were out to spite him however many year ago these switch had been installed while he proceeded to give me a lecture on light switch design and i wa inclined to agree this design wa silly i couldn t help but begin to scream in my head yes but do the light work or not during my inner monologue he say something that i don t know how to take you see i m not an idiot the lightswitch is flipped upside down it only in retrospect i realize he did not find any humor in the situation and probably did not appreciate my failed attempt to receive what i thought to be a joke i hid my smirk quickly and proceeded to endulge him on the rest of his tirade no sir i do apologize if the switch wa confusing and i do see your point it is odd that it wa designed that way translation asshole the light work i get it you don t appreciate how easy of a fix it wa enjoy your light and let me leave he then proceeded to inform me of his problem with the particular brand while allowing me to bask in the glory of his status and can you put me down for no housekeeping all housekeeping at redacted s are scum i cant speak to all redacted s but i m once again inclined to agree with him to a degree housekeeping fuck everyone over at least once but it a shit job for shit pay what cha gonna do it at this point i finally calm di down enough to make my escape and hurry to the front desk so i can politely inform my coworker that di s issue have been adequately solved read shit on him for wasting my time if you think that s the end of this saga you haven t worked in hospitality long enough this post ha gotten seriously long and i just needed somewhere to vent for the day if people are interested i ll post the remainder of the story another day edit find pt here http www reddit com r talesfromthefrontdesk comment fc vo a criminal conspiracy pt

i work at a small local pizza italian place a few hour during the day we offer a lunch buffet with pizza pasta salad etc it s immensely popular and we re usually packed to capacity every lunch period and honestly the food is really good and ha a good reputation in town i come in contact with all kind of asshole and weirdo at work don t we all but i really hate the one who like to complain in order to get something free so these two lady in their s come in and stare at the menu for a while we have counter service so i greeted them kindly and told them to let me know when they were ready to order they ask me how long it would take for a small veggie pizza to be ready i told them about minute one sister scoff loudly ugh we don t have time for that i suggested that they try our buffet since we still had it they inspect the buffet offering clearly not really interested in it because they complained about everything everything ha meat in it we can t eat anything here we are vegetarian one sister is literally yelling so i nicely showed them all the meat free option to help them out i showed them the salad bar pasta salad cheese pizza broccoli bite cheese ravioli spaghetti etc the mean sister yell at me did you not hear me i said we re vegetarian and this spaghetti sauce clearly ha meat in it i said no actually it s just a marinara tomato sauce no meat at all after all that hateful deliberation they decided to eat the buffet ok cool finally we came to a decision a little bit after i start bussing table in between customer mean sister start yelling again shouting for me across the dining room snapping her finger at me hey miss excuse me i quickly walk over to their table i ask if everything is ok mean sister tell me not at all this food is absolutely disgusting and inedible i notice there s at least empty plate on their table from where they ve eaten and she shove them at me and i had to reach over to prevent them from falling to the floor i wa about ready to snap at them but somehow managed to say i m sorry to hear that and she cut me off and rudely demand a refund i didn t even respond and walked away to find my manager my manager ha no patience for complaining customer and usually avoids refund whenever possible he refused to refund them since they finished off a few plate each before saying they didn t like it eventually they left in a huff we have several vegetarian regular who come in and usually get a lot of compliment on our option some people just have a i m going to start shit vibe and can t be pleased
our kitchen ha been going through a turnover recently so nearly every night is a complete shit show since last night wa saturday it wa a shit show on crack the line at the door wa pretty long because it wa taking double the amount of time it usually doe to turn table because food wa running quite late my restaurant is family friendly so we have highchair and booster seat but obviously not enough for every table to have one a host asked me if he could take the highchair from my table because they were all being used and someone at the door needed a highchair my table had their baby sitting on the mom lap when he asked but they were using the chair before and they weren t even halfway done their meal so there wa probably a solid chance they would be putting the baby back in the chair at some point i didn t think it wa right to ask them because if they re not assertive people they might feel pressured to say yes which i think isn t fair to them i also had already had to move them to a different table because we needed to conjoin table for a party so i felt like if i asked them to give me their highchair too they would think our restaurant is an unorganized shit show which it is but you gotta fake it til you make it i told the host no then asked my coworker who is very experienced and a mother if she agrees with me and she said i absolutely did the right thing a lot of the host are new so their shit wa whack too so i wa helping them at the door the next people in line to be sat were the one who needed a highchair so i asked them if the host had already told them they were next but we don t have a highchair so we can seat them without it or wait for a highchair they said he told them but asked me if we could take the highchair from my table which wa visible from where they were standing so i realized at that point the host didn t actually want to take my highchair he wa just asking because they asked him if he could take that specific highchair i told them my logic a to why i couldn t take their highchair so they rephrased and said we re not saying you have to take their highchair but you can at least ask because they might not even want it anymore so i told them i would not be doing that because i m not about to police my table seating arrangement in the middle of their meal i said it nicer than that though lmao they responded with ok but you can at least ask i told them i d go ask my manager because i realized at that point there wa no point in trying to reason with a human wall i didn t actually ask her because she wa so busy and i ve been working there long enough that i know she would much rather me make a judgment call myself than interrupt what she s doing to explain the situation a few minute later a highchair became available so the host sat the family and unfortunately is wa my section i saw them get sat and by the time i made my way there about minute later they had walked out boy am i glad they were on their kanye fuck the man shit so i didn t have to deal with them anymore
we hosted the big boxing match at my restaurant the chicken wing place with the flying mammal hopefully y all know it s not a bat it wa crazy all day we charged a cover some people were not nice we were all swamped you know how it is i get this couple that come in and they are sweet a hell they paid thier cover sat for like hour but they ordered a ton of drink and were super conversational just them being that pleasant alone made my day then at one point the guy asked if i had other table that were being sat i told him no the whole place is full and everyone here is for the fight they felt so bad they were sitting for so long and they were totally genuine about it i wa like you guy paid your cover just like everyone else so no worry you technically bought this table for the night they wondered if the server got any part of the cover and genuinely i did not know still don t at the end of the night these guy left me a tip on a bill i could have cried i really hope they understand how grateful i wa for thier conversation their personality and thier genuine concern for all of u working i really wanted to share such a positive experience with you guy so often we are looked down on and seen a unworthy of praise consideration and basic human kindness because we are in the service industry but we all deserve the kind of people i wa blessed with tonight good luck out there everyone

today i had a lovely conversation over the phone with someone who wanted to make a reservation but refused to give a card to hold the room he had already spoken with central reservation and they obviously were fed up with him and transferred him to someone on site he said he wa paying for his room with a check when he arrived i assured him that s fine we will grab the check when you arrive but in the meantime we need a card to hold the room nothing is charged until check in and we have super flexible cancellation which is why i wa so baffled he threw a fit and said how no hotel ha ever asked him for a credit card to guarantee a reservation before and that clearly we didn t want his business he hung up on me good riddance
so older gentleman from texas check in about and hour ago and a i m running around the property helping other guest with whatnot he asks if i m headed back to the desk and i am so he follows me he then asks for change and then laugh sarcastically for a bit and say well tonight s a historic night it s the first time i ve spent dollar on a coke at a hotel really dollar for a oz coke seems pretty reasonable to me lol
i m looking for a job that actually pay the bill but i don t know what restaurant pay the best in tip etc

this is not a super wild story but it s the first time it s happened to me and i thought it wa a pretty weird comical situation a karen and her family sit down and i bring them water saying their waitress is going to be over with them soon they are not in my section they ask me to taste one of our wine which i didn t mind so much because i wasn t that busy and i didn t want to be rude to them they ask me detail about it and thankfully i know that one well because i ve had it a few time and once a sommelier tasted and described it in front of me i bring it over karen taste it and approves of it ask me for a bottle when i bring it over karen motion me to look at her phone on which she ha the liquor store website opened in quebec they have the same price in all of them and proceeds to show me how much cheaper it is to buy it there also she say it s funny how they don t mention the caramelized note that i talked about and instead say the wine taste of red fruit and spice i say it s a pretty safe bet considering you could say that just about any red wine and ask them what they taste not in a mean way more a friendly conversational make them show their wine knowledge way she kind of laugh it off and proceeds to complain some more about the ridiculous price difference between the liquor store and the restaurant i mean lady have you ever ordered wine at a restaurant what do you want me to say oh i didnt realise they didn t sell it for at the liquor store let me go fix that it is now and the restaurant is losing money meanwhile i m standing there like do i open the bottle or not then the husband say something to brighten up the mood along the line of it s the price you pay to discover a new kind of wine and that s priceless which is stupid for so many reason but whatever they buy the bottle later on she complained that she actually hated the wine and would never get it again she tell my bartender she should ve gotten the one she saw her pouring earlier joke on you karen that one is anyways like i said not super wild but weird to me since it never happened in four year of being a bartender and waitress
one of the thing i absolutely dreaded about working weekend especially evening overnight shift wa knowing i wa going to have to deal with bratty kid disturbing the other guest and really just being obnoxious because their parent rather just get shit faced than spend time with them and it s not like it s the kid fault they re being shit head i would act out too if i thought my parent hated me enough to pick up a fifth and a case of beer first thing after the game competition whatever the fuck get so fucked up they have to be carted back to their room let me roam the hall parking lot in an unfamiliar town without knowing who else could possibly be staying in or stalking the hotel which news flash sex trafficking is kind of a major issue especially at a hotel off one of the main route i wa so sick of seeing these irresponsible parent get messed up and then when i have to call them to get their kid from doing something bad or keeping their year old from wandering off into the parking lot because they left their door open to go in between room and not one parent noticed the baby wa missing i m the bad guy for not watching the camera it s not like my job requires me to you know do my job and check people in get linen do paperwork general maintenance when something break etc no no no my job is apparently to just sit at the front desk and baby sit everyone s kid for free must be nice to live a life so care free you would trust a complete stranger to be in charge of the safety well being of your child it s these kind of parent that genuinely make me think they re trying to get rid of their kid
well that wa an unexpected bit of kindness and generosity tonight gentle reader i have just witnessed an act that give me hope for this cold cruel world of ours good evening thank you for calling lacking tea in municipality this is skwrl speaking how may i help you ahh yes do you have room awailable tonight please ah the halting uncertainty of someone for whom english is not their first language chinese accent still much better than what little german i can recall from school so good for them yes we do have room available for tonight the rate will be xx before tax yy total ah i would like to have that room please of course plenty left come right on in seriously were only at about occupancy for tonight this is the slowest point of the year so about half an hour later he show up international student at the local university not sure why he need the room but meh check in is smooth and painless until we get to the payment at this point i would like to point out that our hotel and a far a i know every hotel in town except the one with the number requires the full amount of the stay on a card no cash deposit can pay with cash but the card must be authorized if you guessed that he didn t have enough on his card you get a gold star it s a thing i ve noticed with folk from china they don t trust credit debit card and are instead content to carry fat wad of cash but this run into issue when one ha to use a card he s got the money cash in hand i m pretty certain he won t be a problem i would like nothing more than to give this poor kid a room for the night but our policy are ironclad on the matter maybe i can risk it the manager is very busy these day surely he wouldn t notice if a cash payment room didn t have a corresponding card authorization this guy won t be a problem right right while i am explaining the situation to him another guest ha entered the lobby after listening to my regretful apology to the younger guest he say something very surprising what if i put it on my card would that work buh um yes that would work if you re okay with that well how much is it would i be liable for anything extra yy with tax no wait taptaptp there we go triple a price is zz you d only be for more if there s damage okay let s do that then to the younger guest is that okay with you so i pay you you pay for room yes yes please his relief is palpable a is mine i hate having to tell guest that policy even though nine time out of ten they re very clearly not someone we would like to rent to and so the chinese student is rented a room his benefactor get what amount to a zz cash withdrawal on his card i don t have to be the bad guy or risk a write up two week before my annual review everyone is happy i thanked the other guest profusely for his generosity and trust if he hadn t been an ota i would have tweaked his rate a much a i wa able amazing how many triple a member show up when i m in a good mood faith in humanity restored yay and don t worry despite what i told the guest i made sure to keep the other card on file for incidental if he set fire to the drape it s on him teal deer guest doesn t have enough on his card to authorize a cash stay another guest accepts his cash and put it on his card problem solved
everything would have been fine two thing to note about our hotel policy to help against fraud we keep room vacant clean instead of vacant ready amp change it when the guest arrives amp show id if we are sold out we precheck all guest in before audit if we aren t we let them go to no show if they are one nighters i usually run audit around am i ll wait a long a i can especially if i have guest who still havent arrived this night i decided to run it around am with two guest left to check in i check one in night stay and let the other go to n audit is almost complete it is just about to print the report so probably minute left in walk a guest at am the one nighter the one that went to n since audit is basically done the system ha already posted amp charged his cc for the night guest tell me he ha actually been here for hour he fell asleep in our parking lot i have two computer that i work on at the fd to be more efficient and one computer is running audit so i check him in on the other one because audit hasn t finished it hasn t changed the business date amp i can put him for the original date instead of night a i would do after audit completed i change his rate to amp transfer the charge from his n reservation so i dont have to refund amp recharge him he go to his room i forgot to change the room to v r before i checked him in and wa about to do it when the other computer start printing my report amp tell me to change the tape for next business day so i do it i remember that i have to go back and switch the room status amp finish checking him in when my computer stop working apparently there wa an unexpected server reboot to happen a soon a i changed the tape i had to wait an hour for it to finish but by the time it did a it switched both computer s business date i try to finish checking him in but it say i cant check in after arrival date i try a few thing before i decide to contact help service thru chat i spent am with them amp they could not help me they kept asking me to log in to a program i dont have access to asking me to have a manager do it after i repeatedly told them i wa alone amp a manager wouldn t get there for at least hour they kept telling me to hold on so they could discus it with their team i leave at am i havent done most of the thing i have to do after audit and i usually leave alot because i always have the time i m completely over it by now ready for the week to be over and it s only what f tuesday they finally get back to me tell me to try checking the guest in one last time didn t work and then told me to try again in an hour if it doesn t work then to call them back but in the meantime they would label the ticket a resolved i wa able to get everything done except the pending guest but didnt clock out until a i apologized to the morning fda explained everything and wished her luck i called back shortly after a when our do would be in amp i know she ha access to the program i didnt i explained it to her and she said she ha no idea what to do with it and would pas it on to our gm had any of those thing happen differently it would have been fine
i m actually a hostess but i figured i would get more feedback on here than i would on another sub a gentleman who ate at my restaurant earlier that day called to say he left his card he came back to get it he chatted with me for a while which wa fine because i had time he wa part of a group of men who come to eat after their aa meeting i asked if he wa new to the program because i hadn t seen him come in with them before he got talking about how religion helped him out of his alcoholism totally fine i actually enjoy hearing about people s life give me some perspective but after minute i really just needed him to stop talking to me he went to the bathroom and i asked my manager on duty if he would call me into the office if the man came up to me again and told him he wa starting to make me feel uncomfortable and i didn t want it to get weird because it happens often in the right leaning privileged area i work in well the guy come back and i look for my manager and he literally had left the building right after i asked him to just watch my back for a few minute the guy go to leave and asks if he can hug me and i so no thank you i don t like hug and he say oh not while you re on the clock and wink and i say no not ever and he tell me he s sorry and that he is so deprived of touch and warmth it made me very uncomfortable and grossed out a i am a year old girl and this man wa probably in his mid s a soon a he left i find my manager and immediately start questioning why he didn t get me out of that situation and why he disappeared after he said he would look out for me and he say oh i thought he left i wa very upset and my manager said if i didn t wanna let him hug me that i should have been more stern about it and that i shouldn t have kept taking to him the thing is i have had people complain that i give off a cold and unfriendly presence so i try my best to people please i would just like some reassurance that my manager is an as hole and doesn t protect his female staff from creepy old men thank you
i work in a small family style restaurant in small town texas mostly regular and people traveling through because it off a major highway last night i had a family of come in parent adult child and teenager they came in ordered and received the best service i could offer it wa a pretty dead wednesday night so i could offer my best the parent were very jovial and always had something funny to say when i approached them and me being me i always had some smart assed reply that would at least get a chuckle the end of the meal come and the dad asks me how much i thought my time wa worth i said something along the line of with how needy you people are i feel like at least dollar then i laughed and said honestly just whatever you feel is appropriate im glad y all had a nice visit i then prebus the table and check on my other table i wa putting in an order when the dad walked up to me and said your wish is granted i look inside and see written super big on the tip line i almost cried and i hugged the parent they said next time they come in they ll ask for me next time a customer asks what you think your time is worth dont be afraid to throw out a high number edit fixed a grammar and spelling mistake
so tonight we went to a local restaurant my family frequents at least time a month the service is never great per se but we love the food and have never had any major problem there tends to be an ever evolving rotation of staff due to the small town vibe of the restaurant so sometimes it can be lacking but i never tip below wherever i go so tonight we decided to head there made a reservation for the restaurant stared small but ha been picking up in business lately which a a local we love to see arrived and wa sat at by the hostess decided beforehand we wanted to order an appetizer immediately a sometimes they bring apps and dinner at the same time menu on table no one from staff come to table mind you it is fairly busy staff rotates a lot and it s busy it s a byob and no one ha come yet to the table decide to raid the station that had a wine opener and wine glass server at all table around u our menu still in the table no one ha even laid eye on u for minute it s been minute at this point it became a game to see if anyone would pay attention to u at this point two waitress and the hostess that sat u have walked past at least time each thank god for wine i haven t eaten all day we wanted to see how long we could go before anyone would notice we existed but i wa too hungry at that point i walked over to the hostess at the front mt and let her know we were there for o minute and still had no service she immediately took care of u it wa odd because she wound up getting u our water taking our order bringing the food etc to my point we have had nothing but good experience there before tonight i would never bring this up on social medium about the place or staff or anything and the food that came out wa awesome like always i guess my question is how did we sit for minute without getting noticed at all by like staff walking by multiple time a a server what would you expect a a tip percentage wise if it wa a hostess doing everything again i am not bringing staff down i love interacting with staff and typically is my minimum tip i know we probably could should have spoken up sooner to the staff but after minute it sort of became a challenger it wa just an odd experience
so i work at a small volunteer run cafe and bookstore it s provided by a nonprofit organization called the mcc they also run thrift store i work a a cashier i m a young year old woman with a learning disability when i came to this cafe and bookstore i wa shy and just wanted to stay in the back washing dish but i ve been there for a year and a half now one of the best cashier and i m always helping train others on till today i had just gotten off of work and stopped by my local dollar store to get a few thing i wa waiting in line when i hear a voice standing behind me in line wa one of the lady who worked in the office of mcc she always came to the cafe for lunch and i always remembered her order she introduced me to her daughter and then told me that everytime she came down to the cafe and saw me at the till she wa comfortable knowing that i knew her order and how she liked it that i wa amazing at what i do it touched me so much i thanked her i cried happy tear all the way home
mine is julia i love her load and i always have a great time at work with her our chef banned u from giggling when in the kitchen
i work at a corporate operated property so we adhere to corporate policy very strictly even if the majority of other franchised property don t the one that get u in trouble the most is the government rate official company wide policy is only federal or state government employee get the rate that mean contractor don t which always lead to problem because most other property avoid the headache by letting them get the rate even though they aren t supposed to i had a guy try to check in a couple week ago he worked for a defense contractor not actually with the department of defense i tell him he can t get the government rate and of course he go on his tirade about how he s stayed at s of hotel and ha never been denied the rate part of me belief him because i know how franchised property operate but the other part of me think he s just telling me that so i ll override it for him after a bit of yelling and throwing his elite status in my face he finally say so are you going to make me stay somewhere because i am an elite member and i can tell you you do not want to do that i tell him i m not forcing him to leave that i can offer him a room but at the regular rate he finally just storm out yelling about how the general manager and our corporate office will hear about this of course he wrote down my name this is a regular occurence i understand why guest would be frustrated with the inconsistentcy the blame is on lazy franchised property who don t conduct the program like they re supposed to so it make my property look bad i get so nervous every time i see a government rate and have to ask for an id because i ve been yelled at too many time

so normally i m the one who s upbeat and jolly but tonight i m beat down and pissed off at my fuckhead of a manager this is kind of a rant so buckle up a few week ago my bos switched from weekly scheduling to biweekly scheduling while i thought this wa a good idea at first i m finding out that this isn t the case two week ago tonight wa barely a blip on the radar tonight i m drowning in a pool of check in housekeeping issue and a lack of staffing i walked into my shift to the front office racing around like a bunch of chicken with their head cut off our slopera system only gave housekeeping half the room they needed to clean fucking slopera so they were rushing to clean room and remember that little fact of me drowning in check in what had been a couple week ago jumped to and i wa the only one on shift and the best part of our fda two were out of town on their day off the guy i wa replacing couldn t stay and my fdm skipped town yesterday out to demon louis so it wa just me our operation manager couldn t stay and hk wasn t trained on front desk so i wa literally screwed is it weird that i m thinking my fdm skipped town just to dodge the bullet of dealing with a check in night like i m betting that s what it wa i wa really tempted to send him this well thanks for skipping town and leaving me alone with arrival totally not a dick move should i send it he made my shit list tonight
every time i leave a cash tip on the table i get some sort of feeling that some random customer busser or other waitress is gonna just snatch it right off the table before my server get it who would ever know the waitress would just think i stiffed her is this a thing that ever really happens
so i work at a place that doe proper meal a well a snack food and we also have bowling and stuff like that anyway just wanted to say that almost every night i get several people ordering snack food like fry and then deciding they want to do x activity that doe not permit them to take their food with them and this right after i already bring their food out like dude you ordered it and knew it wa coming and no i m not taking it back for you or comping it or bringing it back to you later not to mention the amount of people who claim they have been waiting on their fry for a whole minute and that s why they went to do other stuff it take minute minute
oh boy just had an entitled gentlemantm come into my lobby eg hi my wife sent me down for the spread me pardon me eg the stuff you put out me still not understanding i m sorry the stuff we put out eg huffing the spread from to my wife told me to get some me i m sorry sir we do not have food out in the evening but we do offer a complimentary breakfast from to in the morning eg this is ridiculous you told u when we checked in that you put out food me i apologize if i misspoke but we do only offer breakfast in the morning however the restaurant is still open and we do offer room service if you are feeling peckish eg no i don t want to go to the restaurant i want the snack you told u about me unfortunately all i can offer you is the candy i have on my desk or an apple from my fridge eg an apple are you fucking joking me no sir my sense of humor is usually a little better than that shouldn t have said that eg mumble something but i m pretty sure he called me a bitch he then turned and left without so much a a by your leave smh on a positive note i did have a couple that appreciated the comp upgrade i gave them so much they sent me a slice of cheesecake it all balance out
this ha been a trend every since i worked here so we have a designated smoking area and we used to have this generic cigarette bud holder that you could just screw the top off and empty out the dirty cig butt well since we had so many homeless people coming into our parking garage and dumping out cigarette butt just to find the one that were only half smoked or whatever we bout a higher end cig butt catcher it ha a lock on it so you would think that no one could get access to the cigarette bud which would lead to no more mess but we should of known that homeless people are so tact and resourcefulness so now every two week are so some homeless person literally smash the cigarette catcher against the concrete until it open leaving the biggest mess i m pissed because now i have to go outside with a broom and dust pan because guest report there is a huge mess in the smoking area i feel bad for our chief engineer because he wa so proud of this new cig catcher and this will be the rd or th time he ha had to fix it i m so glad i don t have to tell him the bad news because i feel like he is going to be pissed edit changed cig bud to cig butt i thought it wa called a bud but i think ive been hearing it wrong all these year
so even when i get the worst table i m usually always nice i don t like the idea of letting their bag energy effect mine but some day i have my own shit going on and i m just not feeling it i would say of the time i m usually pretty happy my tip are average i smile i make them laugh i am super attentive i don t get their order wrong i don t forget anything yet my tip are between which suck then there are day where i m not smiling i m sort of robotic and my tip are a lot higher now people think i m attractive i have great teeth and my smile get complimented all the time so i like to think me being nice isn t actually scaring anyone off but day when i m just like whatever i m surprised by how much higher my tip are also something i noticed the day i don t wear lipstick are the same day i get tipped more a well which usually coincides with the day i m usually just not feeling it i m wondering if y all ever experienced thing that you do that get you more tip that shouldn t by most people logic
applied a military discount for a military member and the wife wa pissed it didn t apply to the entire check husband stayed silent there were the couple along with kid how do you handle these
since i posted a negative advice seeking post two second ago i thought i needed some positivity i have regular it s not like they ask for me but the universe seems to magically have them come in when it s my turn they re very wonderful people they do tip very very well but they are easy going people that constantly have smile upon their face i took care of them one experience before my current one it wa a slow night and the son and his father left during their service to help a friend with his popped tire on a rainy night they apologized to me but no need it wa so heartwarming that they d face the sickly weather to help a friend out i ve served them multiple time with nothing but good experience they ve been patient with me the son humorously smiled when i awkwardly broke my script to tell him i liked his misfit shirt my last experience with them wa phenomenal i broke through my shell which is rare spending my time on a slow night learning about the son s career and his experience in college his dad caught me off guarded with his dark and witty humor i loved it they wanted to get to know me we talked for a whole hour and the son mentioned he would give me some of his punk band patch for my empty leather jacket we talked about gauge drug use haha career life music and it wa fantastic they come in all the time and people like them remind me on how much worth there can be with being a server no matter how many karen i bitch about or the richards that insult or sexualize me i have people like that father and son that help me continue to serve
okay so i guess this isn t really a big long tale it just mostly a common annoyance i deal with every day so we just opened up our restaurant and bar last month on the th yay everything s great the only downside is since we have no room down here to build add restroom they are all on the second floor i don t know whats so crazy about having bathroom on a separate floor than the lobby ive seen hotel with all sort of layout where the lobby wa technically on the nd floor and you would have to go down a floor to the first floor every day i get alot of what the second floor really why did they build them on the second floor that s weird i ll just hold it i m just confused cause it not like i am asking them to go down the street to use the nearest restroom you literally just walk up a flight or just take an elevator guest just baffle me sometimes with their response maybe having a bathroom on a separate floor is a crazy idea possibly insane let me know

this morning i wa covering the am which probably wa a bad idea because i wa am having a really bad mental breakdown don t worry i have plan to see a doctor in the near future and pretty good at holding it together to do my job anyway my housekeeper today were confused why a room that shouldn t have been occupied wa on their board since they swore up and down that room wa clean the pervious day and no one wa checking out of it or staying over in it today so they do there usual knock and try their key well the door flash yellow no problem sometimes the battery dy and need replacement our maintenance sometimes mark room a dirty and out of order to make sure fd doesn t assign a room with a broken lock on weekend so our laundry lady offer to head up with the skeleton key so hk can make sure if it wa a maintenance thing or if the room actually needed cleaning well apparently the room wa occupied a lady scared our poor laundry lady and very rudely told her off so our laundry lady come down with the hk that wa going to service the room and tell me that the room is occupied and they don t know by whom i check my system and my bucket no one wa assigned this room for day no one should be in this room so i decided to check myself after no answer from the phone i knock and announce i wa from the front desk this woman come to the door and violently swing open the door pulling our flip lock then proceeded to yell at me for disturbing her i try to explain that we didn t have anyone assigned to that room and i needed her name to find and correct our information she snarl her first name then bark about the horrible service and that she had booked the whole top floor with our manager then telling me not to bother her anymore well i go back to the front and look up her name we don t have her first name the hk tell me she thought she heard the woman s last name and offered to check the room that last name wa attached to low and behold this woman wa supposed to have been moved room down the hall because of a missing shower curtain in the one she wa in last night s fd marked that this lady wa moved to this other room without actually moving anyone i informed my mod what happened and explained that the room this lady wa in didn t have a dnd sign both time we went to check the mod stated that if she complains give a bad review it would be taken care of because we were just doing our job and there wasn t a dnd sign this is what happens if you don t make sure people are in the room our system say they are it also a fire issue if we ever needed to evacuate and couldn t find miss pissy pant update dispite me telling the mod what happened and her telling me not to worry about anything the gm still called and blamed me for the angry guest i just told her to talk with both the laundry lady and hk that witnessed all of this after giving her my version of the story this gm for whatever reason always assumes we are lying even though it s her job to back u up in our decision i am getting pretty fucking tired of this place
i checked in a guy who wa a past guest and left his luggage in our property he is a very rude man at first he came in and he seemed to get upset because i did not remember him i told him that we see many people every day and it s hard to remember everyone moving on he wanted a room in the first floor but i told him we did not have any suite in the first floor available and that seemed to annoy him more then he asked for water and said i want them in my room to which i replied we give them out here at the desk i gave him a snack a well even though he is a lower tier just to change his attitude he looked at the goody bag with disappointment like did he expect a steak in there after a while i did remember him he wa the very entitled guy who stayed with u a couple of month back very nasty personality everyone at the front desk and even housekeeping had an issue with how he acted towards them how embarrassing for someone to remember you from your ugly personality am i right

i used to work in a restaurant i ve had a lot of experience with entitled customer and terrible management i think my brain shoved those memory somewhere in my head and filed it away for good all i remember is how not to act when eating out in a restaurant
some year ago i worked for a company that specialized in sushi and basic japanese food it wa a good job but a difficult one made so by the fact all the chef manager and most of the server were pretty terrible at their job but they had all known each other for year and kept making excuse to cover one another since i wa the new guy i had the hardest job of all working the hot food section our restaurant worked like a regular sushi place all the cold food and sushi went on a belt that traveled slowly round all the table any hot food order and there were a lot of those were sent to the kitchen i e me i worked that section alone even on day when we being slammed and i had so many order the delay on food wa up to an hour long wa i always alone i wa also expected to prepare all the sauce clean the fryer cook rice and cover the kp when he went on break i wa always alone even when we had eight other chef in the kitchen not one could be convinced to help me out one would spend the day slicing up the fish the rest would be prepping sushi or standing on their phone management did not give a shit what management did care about wa my performance reagrdless of how hard i worked it wa never good enough and any customer complaint regardless of context were often excused a being my fault the store manager a read headed bos girl type would spend hour standing behind me being over critical of everything i did i worked hour shift from am till pm often day in a row at pm someone else would come in take over from me the restaurant closed an hour later and they got the reward beer they would give out at the end of busy shift i had worked at a fast food place previously so i had been more willing just to put my head down and get on with the job in spite of the fact it wa killing me i finally did complain several time no one cared finally after month i became unwell and wa disagnosed with muscle strain and fatigue my dr informed the restaurant i would have to work le so they fired me the red headed bos girl manager dragged me into the office to explain that not only wa i utter hopeless at the three person job i wa doing by myself for hour a day for minimum wage but a customer had complained about finding a hair in her food which had been identifed a being from my beard every other chef cept for one had long hair and a beard but it wa identifed from my beard specifically it sounded like bullshit to me but i didn t complain they expected me to finish my hour shift that day instead i walked out a few day later i wa hired by their rival company across the street who paid me more treated me with more respect and i ve found a large number of other people who have also previously worked at that sushi place and had the same experience amp x b fast forward two year amp x b now in better sushi place i am in charge of the ramen section i ve won several in house award for my cooking and am generally considered to be one of the best at what i do outside of a small incident involing a vegan menu event i really love this job and had generally forgotten about previous sushi place until the day we started hiring new manager we needed new floor manager the company had made the classic error of promoting good server to floor manager level and it hasn t worked we need someone with experience and a few have applied today is trial shift day for three of the promising applicant the first one did very well even noticed the few trap laid out by managerment to try and catch slacker the second wa nervious but did ok but when the time for the third applicant come in walk red headed bos girl from previous job she greets everyone scan along the kitchen line at all the other chef then her eye meet me in my different coloured hat showing that i am at a sou chef level with the several award i have won pinned into the side i give her a smile and a wave she dead pan stare at me for a lot longer than necessary before marching off to greet the manager her trial end in failure not only is she slow and unable to direct the staff barking confusing order and getting over stressed at everything she also cannot perform at a basic server level cannot pour drink and run food like a clumsy st timer it wa a privalage and an honor to hear the other server complain non stop about her inability and general agressive nature remembering how difficult she had made thing for me at my previous job and the bullshit she had made up to get me fired her trail ended early she wa politely thanked and we never saw her again manager came over to me after he heard i had previously worked under her and asked for an opinion i gave him my honest one told him of my time working at other sushi place and the fact i still have back problem from it he nodded trashed her r sum and that wa that

hello there everyone i work night in a city centre hotel in the uk and on thursday we had quite the fun night it wa unusually busy for a midweek night we had a few guest drinking stupid amount in the bar and one woman w wa on the verge of passing out so the party made the decision to get everyone to go to bed around this time we get a phone call from a different woman w equally drunk telling u she ha broken up with her boyfriend and we shouldn t let him back in fun time but fortunately we didn t see or hear from him minute later w on the phone again and we have the same conversation a few more minute later and a woman stumble into reception it s w and we have that same conversation for the rd time in quick succession cut to around i m post audit and about people show up to check in after a delayed flight lot of reinstating and checking in and i ve got flight crew leaving soon that i need to prepare for so the last thing i need is any distraction of course now the phone ring a regular couple hearing banging from the room above who is in the room above w of course i knock on her door and ask if everything s okay and what the banging is w oh i heard that that s why i answered the door me no that wa me knocking the door i m here to ask about the banging that wa coming from inside the room it s at this point i realise i m not getting any sense out of her so i have to move the regular which they didn t mind too much i get to do my floor check around and all the bedroom are finally nice and quiet i get down to the other floor and come across w again she is trying to get into one of the meeting room thinking it s her bedroom i ask her what room she should be in it s on the th floor and she wa on the nd understandable while in the lift but when she walked out to see a seating area a bar and precisely zero fucking bedroom it s inexcusable by this point i ve run out of my daily quota of fuck to give so i take her up with very little empathy a she grab all her thing off the table i need to carry on with my floor check and go back to the nd floor and see if she ha left anything behind what is left on the table a pair of knickers my first thought what how why what the fuck is happening tonight so i have to now check the cctv to see what she did and for how long she wa there i m not sure i wa prepared for what i saw she first appears stumbling around the corridor clearly without a clue of where she is or where she is trying to get to she try to lean on the table but fall over get up only to fall over again twice she then give up and ha a nap for a couple of hour she wake up at this point she appears committed to sleeping there and take her shoe off next an attempt to take off her tights but that failed another long time trying to stand up and eventually she s up and off come the dress already exposing far too much to the camera due to the failed attempt at taking off the tights but now they are coming off and she doesn t stop there the aforementioned knickers now and she is in a public place in just her bra now i don t have boob but i m led to believe the bra is the least comfortable item of clothing so why she kept that on i don t know she then try to put the knickers back on but that required standing on one foot for a short time down she went again a small saving grace to me and my colleague watching is that the camera is far enough away and poor enough quality for it not to be too disturbing back to sleep she went she wake up again probably freezing and a little sobered up and put her coat on she then try sleeping on the table but fall off that wa when she try getting into the meeting room and i found her completely and thankfully unaware that she almost naked under the coat the only thing left to see on camera is my reaction to finding the underwear and my colleague all think that it wa the funniest bit now i think i m glad we were so busy because if i had noticed her a soon a she went up i wouldn t have had the best laugh i ve had for a long time edit i forgot to mention i wa still there when w checked out at am she wa clearly holding back sick with a look of serious regret that i m all too familiar with

after graduating college i went to the north dakota oil field to get a head start on paying my loan i worked at a truck wash it wa not a pleasant job but i quickly wa making hour working hour a week sweet sweet overtime pay plus about week on average in tip since the oil tanker were driving on gravel and dirt road to access the well they would constantly accumulate layer of dust over the whole rig because of this it either took a lot of chemical a combination of hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid and or hydrofluoric acid called alumabrite or scrubbing to remove it it wa cheaper to use the chemical since scrubbing to time a long the downside to the chemical is it remove any polish that is on the metal to polish a trailer or that size it would cost thousand of dollar therefore we were very hesitant to use it on anything that still had a polish under all the dirt one day a guy come in with a trailer that is still polished i ask if he want u to just use soap which would leave it still dull scrub the whole thing which would cost an extra and extra hour or use the acid on the trailer he decides he want just the soap and assures me his trailer would look shiny again after that we wash the truck a he ordered he walk around and asks how can we call this clean why is there still dirt on his trailer i reply that s hard work and he cut me off he go on this big lecture about he s working hour a week sleeping in his truck missing his family that s hard work you need to learn how to work hard if you re going to last out here boy he said i finally get a chance to talk because it s hard and take more time it cost an extra if you want to go and pay for the additional labor cost we will gladly wash your truck is that what you want na i m good and he left next time i saw him he had used the acid on his trailer
i m sure that by now a shining reference is a tired trope among hotel employee especially for u na employee i ve only ever worked at two hotel and one of them wa part of the university i went to a relatively cozy campus job the other that i currently work at is an extended stay chain the extended stay chain is easily the slowest hotel of the two so thankfully that lends itself for a lot of lax na shift just remember to bring a book because it get slow we re also a rare hotel that still delivers paper folio under the door but recently we re trying to phase that out because a you d imagine it s terribly eco unfriendly and the cost of paper add up often we re at le than occupancy anyway this one night wa a standard na shift for me when i deliver folio under the door i like to listen to music on my headphone and the music i like to listen to can be anything from hip hop to ambient music i don t think i m allowed to do this but no one ha found out so far and i m not planning to stay at this job for very long so i don t really care anyway i m up in the hotel hallway delivering folio under the door and this particular night i ve decided to listen to dark ambient music aka the music genre of score to many a horror film granted this wa my fault but i didn t suspect anything weird would end up happening it doesn t help that my headphone were noise cancelling a well then all of a sudden something behind me is tugging at my pant i look behind me and it s a cry little girl probably about year old all by herself my heart practically skip ten beat clearly she s more scared than i am but paired with the dark ambient music i felt like a horror movie scene a la the shining had suddenly came to life she keep telling me i lost my family i m confused and freaked out a hell so i pause my music and i ask her where her room is she ha no clue so i tell her that we re going to find her parent and i walk her down to the front desk after some pressing i find out her parent s last name and first name i call their room and i hold on the line forever like for at least minute and the parent is still answering mind you our hotel phone ring are loud so i start to think the parent are out of the room and i have to call the cop or something she s behind the front desk with me because she s obviously too afraid to leave my side and shortly after i call the parent finally come down they come to the front desk and they ask have you seen or found a little girl the parent are obviously confused and concerned i pick up the little girl and the parent claim their child very relieved according to the parent the little girl wa sleeping in the bed with them and must ve left the room on her own without the parent knowing but they said they have no idea how that could ve happened or how the little girl could have lost them when they were in the same hotel room the entire time the parent were apparently just very deep sleeper

i ve been a host for two month and everyone i work with agrees that i pretty much have it down most of the server i work with are amazing and i couldn t ask for better coworkers however just like with any workplace i have a few bitchy or whiny server i ve only ever got yelled at twice the first time wa my second week and a server wa stressed and yelled at me for no reason he admitted that he wa being a bitch i personally think it s because i wa new and quiet however i did tell him that the next time he ha a problem he needed to speak to me with respect we apologized and he ha never disrespected me again the second time wa today and a server wa stressed out but we keep seating her because we didn t know she said we should ve used our intuition and known to put her on hold she only had table and we sat her with a th all were top or le though and she s been working there for year almost all of our server even the new one can handle at least table some up to at once i understand that serving is hard and stressful but i don t think this give them the right to take all their frustration out on host unless the host really fuck up ofc she came up and yelled at me because we couldn t read her mind and i bit my tongue then she came back up to yell at my other host and i told her to calm down and that i felt she wa talking to u in a disrespectful tone which i wasn t going to stand for my other host tried to explain to her that she needed to tell u next time but the server ignored her and basically said we were dumb the other host then just started kissing her as and apologizing after a while i went to talk to her again and apologize and we made up however the other host wa upset because i stood up for u and we get paid part of their tip i honestly didn t think about the tip thing so i promised never to do it again when other host were on the tip share with me however the most we make is hr on a busy day i feel like it is not worth it to be constantly getting disrespected and kissing up to people especially because that isn t a livable wage i also feel that money will never be a important a my self worth i wa bullied all through school and went into a deep depression in th grade which caused me to lose my will to live literally after that i didn t let anybody treat me however they wanted to i will never be a push over again i always stood my ground so maybe this ha to do with my feeling i don t have the energy to get in a full blown fight with them though i have never gone past asking for respect after that i just stop talking if they continue to yell i know many people will think then just quit and i am when i find something else in the meantime i wanted to know if other host stay passive or if y all also stand up for yourselves
so we have a very very small kitchen at work to give the chef a chance to change over from breakfast mode to lunch mode we stop taking breakfast order at and only start taking lunch order at it s written on the menu out the front in big letter but nobody actually read that so we give people the head up before we seat them if they wander in during the changeover most are either happy to just nurse a drink and chat until lunch start or if they re really hungry or in a hurry they just go somewhere else not these lady they walk in at i inform them that they ve missed breakfast but lunch start in and in the meantime we have a selection of cake and slice lady l is understanding her friend l is kinda rude l so you don t have anything to eat until me like i said we have the cake cabinet l so we have to wait minute if we want to order lunch me unfortunately our kitchen is very small so yes the chef need a little time between breakfast and lunch to re set l it s closer to minute now we can just have a coffee and it ll give u a chance to look at the menu finally some sense so i seat them give them some menu and take coffee order they sit there for the minute talking not looking at the menu at all and we checked on them a total of three more time before finally minute later they were finally ready to order our barista wa in a particularly pissy mood and went down the corridor to bitch to the chef about it even though he hadn t had to deal with them at all if you re going to take minute to order what is the point of bitching that you can t order for

i work a floor staff in a busy restaurant bar there s around floor staff and manager in our section a gm assistant manager and supervisor the assistant manager is a real asshole everyone in the building ha consistent problem with him he s super condescending rude and pick on people he doe not have good social skill and belief because he is the manager everyone should listen to him no question asked he want to be the bos but is a dick so people don t listen to him exasperating the situation the gm and supervisor are really helpful good leader so people listen to them and they think the same about him but don t want to deal with him or the problem he cause so it just go on i tried talking to him a couple of time cause i actually liked the guy at heart i believe if there s an issue you should talk about it with the person and see if you can move forward it semi worked he wa a little conscious of speaking to people in a le condescending way but went back to being horrible to work with the last conversation we had made thing worse though he basically said that because i m floor staff and part time i don t care about my job a much a him so only his opinion matter and that i pick on stuff he say because i don t like him that s not true most people talk shit about him behind his back the whole time if i didn t like respect him i would just let that continue without letting him know there s a problem he basically said that i m wrong he s right and i m the one that s the problem because i m rude to him kinda true i talk back to his bullshit a lot which some people don t i will admit i m not the nicest to him however he is the only person in the building i have consistent problem with while absolutely everyone ha a problem with him he s been on the warpath since picking on people who he know will take his shit more than i or others will i e taking one girl aside to scream at her for eating behind the bar even though other people were eating on the floor at the time including the gm he is constantly looking for stuff to pull her up on my question is how do i proceed i am thinking about filing a complaint against him maybe requesting that he should do a leader skill training program or something ha anyone had a similar problem or filed a complaint against a manager i feel like it s kind of petty but no one in the building like working with him and he refuse to believe there s a problem or maybe writing him a letter in a le argumentative way since our conversation haven t gone so well any advice on dealing with these kind of people would be appreciated
so last night i had a room that attempted to have a party at around am not only that but decided that they were going to start smoking weed in the room i know they were a i saw and smelled it coming through the room door i quickly informed them of our pm to am quiet policy and that we are a non smoking hotel they were fine after that fast forward to tonight while i wa out smoking i saw guy walking by me each with pack in hand just around midnight they approached the door to the other building btw we have building one with no camera luckily there are only room in the other building so not difficult to deal with anyway a soon a they entered the building i saw them going up the stair just across from the main entrance i heard them enter the room it wa at this point where i got a call from a guest and wa dealing with their frustrating butt for over an hour on the th floor and could hear people going up and down the back stair from the nd floor more time while i wa dealing with these other guest how did i hear it each room ha a main door and and emergency exit door that access a metal stairwell and those metal stair well echo throughout the building you know the one the metal stair with the echoing hallway i heard this a i wa in the kitchen on the th floor room which is very near the emergency exit so a soon a i m done with the th floor guest i head down to the nd floor and step off the elevator even outside of the front room door i could hear the party again i thought to myself i thought they would have learned from last night apparently they didn t so around i give step outside where all of them are on the balcony just over head the reservation said why do i see people being extremely loud and all outside smoking weed i told them who i wa and gave them a warning to shut it down i even enforced the fact that people were registered to the room and number above that would need to be leaving immediately i also made sure to ask them if they remembered that i had contacted them last night a well they acknowledged it i unfortunately had to go back to the other building where the fd is and run the audit on the outside camera i saw people not the guest come out of the door to the other building and walk by the window directly across the street from the fd don t know why we have a camera there but not anywhere else in that building a soon a i finish the audit which luckily only take a few minute i walked back outside and looked up to the patio the same people plus the guest were back on the patio wait a minute huh i go back inside and go to the camera guess what i see these guy had passed my window walked across the street walked on the other side and crossed the street again to go back to the party a i wa looking up the woman with the short bleached hair saw me and said oh shit i spoke up to them and told them they had minute to leave and not come back and to tell the person who wa on the room reservation to call the front desk he did i informed him again about the party last night and that it would not happen tonight either he told me to fuck myself my response wa now he had minute to pack up and leave of his own accord or the police would be called but i needed to see him drop the key card in the slot at the front door shockingly they were out in and made sure to flip me off a they were getting in the uber and btw guess how the reservation wa made one guess hint the worst ota on the planet a soon a they left i ran up to the room it wa completely trashed and there wa a can of beer with both cigarette buts and a roach inside guess who got charged for smoking added to the dnr list and ha been sent an email via the ota that there will be no refund due to eviction amp x b should have listened to my warning the first night and just a i finished typing this out i have a completely unrelated guest who i also warned last night now attempting to let a bunch of people in the back door here we go again

of course it wa busy front of house but one slacked off kept sitting down kept telling u to do the difficult job they avoided work by doing easier job that didn t even need doing like washing up we only tell people to wash up if the kitchen staff are swamped table weren t being cleaned properly i couldn t be in place at once cutlery wasn t being replenished it wa a nightmare thankfully we didn t have angry customer but man i tried my very best to keep on top of everything didn t have a break all day
basically the title but more detail i have severely strained a muscle in my leg that run from my glute all the way to the back of my knee we have to do all the serving stuff plus bus our own table think climbing into booth to get kid drink they stuff down there crayon get napkin and carry tub to sort and dump he told me not to exercise sent me to pt i asked to confirm if i should stay off my leg and he said yes i asked him what to do about work and he wa silent nice doctor helpful with getting referral just not easy to get an answer from without going into my own detail have any of you gone into work edit with an injury where you definitely made it worse before it got better from physical therapy when you re told massage and brace etc aren t helpful are you glad you went to work or not so much
a short tale we all know some guest are the epitome of laziness and selfishness this guest take it all a the title suggest this tale reloves around a dirty nappy we all know one of the by product of todlers is they use nappy for doing their business these most of the time will stink and one want to be around a fresh one so you usually dispose of them in napy bag then put in a bin well not this guest this guest decided the best place to put a use full nappy wa outside of his bedroom door why he thought this wa an exceptable place i have no idea we have a bin in the bathroom and a bin in the bedroom also his room wa maybe ft from reception where i could have dispose of them in the bin out back but not the corridor is the best place out of site out of mind so they say now where the fun part for me begin at my site im known for not giving a shit about confronting people where some of my colleague are a bit more hesitant unless it warranted i had the pleasure of chewing this guest out about the best pratice of disposing of soiled nappy mention all the young child that could have picked it up the damage it could have caused to the carpet in the corridor if it would have leak and how they would be liable etc finger crossed they got the point because no one want to to clean up dirty nappy but part of of me want to charge them for a replacement carpet at extortionate markup tldr guest put dirty nappy in the corridor instead of bin in room ft away from reception
so i m a culinary student and i ve been working for a hotel restaurant in the heart of budapest for half a year now usual morning bussing table for the breakfast buffet today we had ton of amazing guest and i loved listening to their story and giving them direction and idea on what to do visit in the city lunch roll around we had our quarter yearly staff birthday s first this is basically how we celebrate the staff s birthday from the last three month four time a year on one day with a course meal the dessert being a slice of birthday cake after we served that a few remained and our coworker in charge let u have one then the la carte start coming in and i got a table of these irish gentleman knew what they wanted from the start knew how they d be paying and we re genuinely amazing about what i m about to describe next a they came in they ordered rum so i bring those in first orange slice and brown sugar in tow they politely ask me to bring them cola separately and apologize for not specifying that they wanted rum amp coke from the start so i get the glass bottle of coke on my metal tray you know the one after putting down the first four i trip hard dropping the tray and basically headbutting the floor and dousing myself in ice cold coca cola on an already cold day now you need to know that i can t handle messing up due to aspergers any mistake put a ball amp chain on me emotionally and affect my mental health because i put myself down by replaying it on loop unconsciously my coworkers imediatelly jumped in to help by mopping up picking up the bottle thankfully none broke serving the customer and by providing me with a new shirt and apron even the capital b bos acted like a true leader and instead of the hellfire i thought he d unleash said that it happens to the best of u and that everything is and will be okay after putting on the new clothes i went to offer my sincere apology the folk at the table simply said just have a shot rum on u it ll straighten you out for the next table seriously though no problem my coworkers bos briefly turned good leader and these customer saved my day from being ruined due to my own head and i owe them my deepest grattitude thanks for reading
working a a server for two year i can t believe that i actually got a customer like this today what make you think that you can literally walk into a restuarant and camp out for an hour after telling the server you won t be ordering anything it s more infuriating that i ve got no manager on the floor their phone is always on silent and they were in a meeting and i m working alone i should ve called security to throw his as out cause now this a hole think he can just do this at any other restaurant
if you have a bad signal please do not yell at me for not being able to hear you if you speak quietly please do not get angry if i cannot hear you if you talk very fast please don t get annoyed if i ask to clarify and confirm your order we often have customer calling in with order and the amount of time where i have had to apologise to the customer despite it not being my fault that i can t hear them a man almost made me cry over the phone during last night s shift a he placed a delivery order to an awkward address and began yelling at me for not understanding which only made it harder to listen to what he wa saying exactly what a dick
friend of mine wa working a dayshift with me and one other server this one table wa just giving him a really hard time being really pain this restaurant is a little burger sandwich and pizza shop in a tourist area so we have a mix of regular that are local some that are summer rental and then some just passing thru anyway my buddy finally get fed up with them being just rude to him and asked the other server if he want to take over the table he wa always money hungry so he jumped at the chance they are rude to him but he let it slide figuring he won t get much of a tip anyway they go to leave and just pull out crumpled up money and drop it on top of the bill and say that should cover it loud enough that we all heard them and then walk out the new server go to make sure they left enough flattens out the money and find that they left about over the amount because they had a and a crumpled up in smaller bill my buddy just said congrats without any hard feeling he had a temper to him so he wa happy to not have to deal with them

happy new year dear subreddit in honor of the holiday i would like to share a tale of the first new year s eve i worked on night audit and until tonight it wa the last this wa year ago just after i had hit my st year with the company my first nye wa worked on nd shift at a different property that wa much slower and farther away from all the downtown crazy this story will go by fast some of the detail are fuzzy a so much happened that night i never really had the chance to process one crisis before the next one happened now my city ha one of the new year s eve celebration in the whole country there s live music and band free cover for all the bar downtown firework giant confetti cannon i mean they pull out all the stop i came in expecting some sort of crazy behavior and a lot of annoying slightly entertaining drunken antic but i don t think anything could have prepared me for the sheer pandemonium and madness of the night when i get to the desk i am met by two drunk in the middle of some sort of dick measuring contest not literally these clown are puffing up their chest and attempting to look taller and larger than each other it s like watching emu challenge each other the poor girl i wa relieving looked terrified of what they were going to do now we had an lp officer on the weekend and major holiday like this but they were nowhere to be seen right now i ask what wa going on and apparently one of the gentleman made a pas at the other guy s girlfriend and one thing led to another and by the time the fda filled me in they were throwing punch at each other i attempt to diffuse the situation without getting physically involved but nothing would stop those two i radio for lp while the fda called metro police before she could get off the phone a university police officer from the nearby university apparently managed to see what wa going on we had very large floor to ceiling window in the lobby while he wa coming out of the fast food restaurant across the street and thankfully intervened both dude were arrested by metro when they arrived not but an hour later i kid you not a drunk irishman pulled the fire alarm on the th floor apparently he couldn t remember what his room number wa and determined that pulling the fire alarm would be the best possible solution to finding out what room he had booked for a week he wa also arrested naturally maybe hour or so after he wa hauled off i had one of my few remaining check in arrive while going about the check in process checking id swiping card informing him about room tax amp incidental hold his card decline i inform him a tactfully a i could but this guy wa not happy about his card declining he gave me the usual crap i just put money on there there s no way it declined it wa working this morning blah blah blah now this gentleman also smelled like a walking distillery he s obviously been downtown partying and decides in his alcohol fueled logic that showing me his online bank app would prove that he had money on there which he did that morning before he spent roughly at the various bar downtown according to the charge statement i inform him that he can t stay here without having the money to pay for it he delivers a few threat of violence along the line of listen you little s i ll beat your a into the ground if you don t give me my f room now and i promptly call the police they arrive he try the same crap on them and of course they haul him off by this point it s maybe in the morning i m just now able to flip the date all alcohol sale have stopped then a lady come in from her night of partying dropped off by a cab sits in the lobby a she try to find her room key open her tiny clutch heave and vomit right into it so much so that the clutch overflow and the vomit get onto the couch which had to be replaces a the stain could not be removed lp find out what room she wa in and escort her up while the houseman and i attempt to clean up what we can of the mess by the time we finish the morning manager are coming in i had one manager who kept expecting me to set up the breakfast equipment now some night like this night i wa far too busy i had some other manager who explicitly told me that the breakfast set up wa not my job it wa appreciated but not required the manager who came in that morning first thing realizes the breakfast equipment is not set up and proceeds to chew me out for it i take it all in but my tolerance for crap his more than reached it limit after he s finally done i tell him i m sorry for not setting up the breakfast area and that he wa right i should have prioritized that over the fire alarm being pulled people fist fighting in the lobby dealing with threat of violence and helping clean up a mess of vomit before guest come down to see it my tone just overflowing with a much vitriol and snark a could manage a soon a hit i clocked out went home and drank a lot of whiskey
not a rant this time but a heartwarming story for those front desk agent starting out or have yet to break the ice with the other department prior to reentering the hospitality industry i owned a small cleaning business in los angeles for house cleaning it wa just myself and since a lot of family related issue were going on i wa basically keeping the family afloat hour a day day a month i cleaned home this includes travel and after i wa done i d spend hour doing admin task however i wa barely pulling in a month net and ended up living out of my car to shorten the time it took to travel job that lasted month before my body gave out i noticed at the small property i worked at the cleaning staff were sometimes abrasive with the manager supervisor and some other fd staff not mean but not the most bonded one day i wa sitting with the staff who barely knew english during a lunch break i d always joke around and ask how everyone wa doing etc often time hearing the difficulty of the job being overworked etc half truth half general complaint from periodic short staffing when i joked around about me being a cleaner before and losing half my sense of smell they laughed they asked me if i had family or why i wa working there i told them what i did prior during my day of housecleaning and showed them picture i took their eye lit up surprised by the work i did and amount of hour i put in a if i wa speaking their language fluently i told them the way it felt the fatigue and so forth and that i understand what they are going through when rushed short staffed etc that it wa the reason i d make guest wait with an overhead of minute depending on if they had to stop in the middle of a room to clean another for an arrival not to put down my other coworkers but it s difficult to understand what the cleaning staff go through unless you ve done it yourself for a certain period of time some had two job others one one who barely see their child etc since then i ve noticed even when tired the cleaning staff are very responsive and patient towards me when i inquire about anything from lost and found to having to stop cleaning one room and moving on to another when a guest arrives early not to say they don t do the same for the other staff but i don t hear them complaining a much around me and at time even joking about how busy a day is or what they will do to relax after needle to say and may be common knowledge for any new fd agent gaining the respect and understanding of the cleaning staff go a long way especially if you aren t fluent in their language of course this depends on your location and the housekeeping staff but at least at my location it s worked out this way edit thank you for the gold kind stranger due to a few downvoted comment regarding the nature of this post i want to clarify the intent i ve noticed in previous property there can be a fairly large disconnect between the front desk staff and maintenance cleaning staff this can create a void between colleague even conflict due to different background and viewpoint during heavier shift my experience in cleaning home prior to being hired where i am is le about that part of my life and more on being able to relate to the life and or work of people who can only work those job

i have worked roughly year in the restaurant industry in both arizona and california ranging from fast food to dine in it s been over a decade since i ve worked in any type of restaurant however some outstanding event will never leave my memory i ll post this one first and when i have the time i ll post others i used to be a server at a popular seafood restaurant in the inland empire there wa a large black population in the city the restaurant wa in so a large portion of our guest would be black people this never bothered me because well why the heck should it i took care of everyone all the same who crossed my path and i ve never had any issue well it wasn t until i wa about a month into this restaurant and working the lunch shift that i started to fully pay attention to how my fellow server treated customer this particular day had a lot of black guest there were groan coming from my co worker all complaining that black people are cheap they don t tip blah blah blah so i asked one server if it s that much of an issue for you i ll be happy to take your table they happily said yes soon the majority of server all gave up their table to me simply because the people were black and they thought it would be a waste of time i wa really pissed and disappointed in everyone but i didn t have too much of a backbone nor an understanding of how to begin to have a talk about race with others so i did the next best thing any time a table had left i went to check my tip then i went to the server who gave up their table to me and told them how much i wa tipped each time it wa at least tip each time they seemed shocked and a little upset they gave up the table by the end of my shift i made about though that would be the only time i would ever make that during lunch because other server didn t give up a many table to me anymore after the lunch rush i had come to the conclusion that maybe black people don t suck at tipping maybe your crappy attitude towards them affect how you serve them and you just suck why should they tip you in arizona mexican people were the target of this stereotyping again i ve never had an issue with any person of any race i wa tipped based on how well i served them or from what they could afford everyone deserves to have a night out but that doesn t mean that they can also afford to tip generously

i don t really know why i enjoy reading this sub so much i ve never worked in a hotel or anything like that maybe it s just because i really enjoy staying in hotel i try to be a good guest and mind my own business and not be any trouble because there s almost never anything worth causing trouble about although i did post here once before a penance for being an officious prick to a front desk worker and i don t want to repeat that i used to travel for work or time a year now down to or there wa one hotel i used to stay in a lot a very nice one in suburban washington d c great staff great room right in a downtown area right off the beltway i always enjoyed staying there except for the time they lost my car well not even my car it wa a government vehicle i wa using for the trip i wa checking out and i handed the fda my slip to give to the valet service here s the slip for my car she peered at her computer screen uhh we don t show that you have a car with u a sense of creeping dread started to wash over me well i gave the valet service my key when i got in last night i have the slip right here she looked again no i m definitely not seeing anything are you sure you left the car here i showed her my slip again and she shook her head again the sense of dread wa quickly turning into anger tell me you did not just lose my government vehicle which i gave to your valet service last night there wa nothing else the fda could do she called the valet manager who looked for my key in the key box nothing the poor fda called the manager i wa so angry i couldn t see straight but i tried pretty hard to keep it together since it still wasn t clear what had happened left unsaid wa the worst case scenario theft the manager the valet manager and i ended up looking on all four underground level of parking we found the car now we had to figure out where the key were they put in a call to the valet worker who had taken my key to see if he had accidentally taken the key home or something else in the meantime i tried to not explode with a complimentary breakfast buffet i wasn t really hungry the manager assured me that if the key couldn t be found they would hire a locksmith at hotel expense to come out and make a new set that didn t make me feel any better since i would still be on the hook for the original key and the government issued gas card attached to the key ring without the original i would probably not be allowed to use a government vehicle again and wa facing other probable write ups about two hour later they found the key on the floor of some other guy s car where the valet had accidentally dropped them the manager apologized profusely and gave me like a million point on my hotel reward account i wasn t rude but i probably wa not extremely gracious either since i just wanted to get home at that point next time i had to stay over in the area i stayed at the same place same great hotel with the same great room a always but the valet service wa gone and the underground lot wa now self park

not sure if this belongs here since i wasn t the server but participated in the sting operation backstory my wife and i had our favorite restaurant that we frequented a lot at least once a week so we got to know everyone working there pretty well and became close friend with a few of the server and the manager one of our friend wa working that night a and approached u to help him out he said he got complaint from a couple of server about tip completely missing e g on a bill from regular that always tip he wa suspecting that it the busboy doing it but had no proof we were sitting across from a table that wa just finishing up so our friend waited until they were gone and replaced the tip with like of his own the actual tip wa much larger and left the check holder on the table he then asked u to just keep an eye on the table when the busboy came by and report back to him well a we watched he cleared the table put the check holder in his apron and disappeared around the corner to a hidden section of the restaurant and returned a minute later to replace the holder to the now clean table our friend came by and a expected the holder wa empty we then relayed what we saw busboy taking the holder disppearing etc i remember seeing him slump visibly and walk off like he knew the truth but didn t want it to be so we talked later with our friend and he along with the manager confronted the busboy on what happened and gave him the chance to confess and be fired with no further action taken he owned up to it and wa escorted out everyone working there wa kind of bummed even despite getting their tip stolen because it wa a small family owned type place and the owner had taken a chance on hiring the kid everyone really liked him and he d had some trouble earlier on in life and wa trying to turn thing around he wa only like at the time but couldn t seem to get out of his own way i had two reaction to this the first wa the complete r unethicallifeprotips route of why in the world are you the taking the whole tip skim a few buck here and there you may not get caught at least for awhile but you take the whole damn tip the second wa the parent in me wanted to pull him aside and just try to get through they took a chance on hiring you and you pull this crap this isn t rockbottom but you are heading there quick if you don t shape up
no guest were involved in this but i think ya ll will enjoy this short story amp x b back in the mid s i wa the afom for a hotel that wa mid range and slowly getting worse due to the lack of upkeep from the new owner one day a couple of police detective show up to speak with the gm i get called into the office and told that i have to go find the old payroll file from year ago when the previous owner were still in charge they were short on the detail but basically told me that mr x a former front desk employee wa involved in a murder investigation in order to clear him a a suspect they needed proof that he wa working the night of the crime i had been at the hotel when this guy worked there but i wasn t working the front desk i recognized the name i told them i would be happy to search but we had different storage room that had pile of box shoved into the back stacked to the ceiling i had no idea where to even start the stupid box weren t even labeled keep in mind at the time we still clocked in using one of those old type press machine that stamp the date time on your card they impressed upon me the importance of finding the payroll because mr x wa questioned at the time of the crime and claimed he wa working someone dropped the ball way back then because no one verified his alibi now the investigation had circled back to mr x and they absolutely needed to know if he wa at work that night so they could clear him again a a suspect to me it seemed like they really just wanted to prove this guy wasn t involved so they could move on and close the file i spent the next day digging through box in the storage room whenever i had time i still had to work the fd and do my own daily work i wa really pumped about helping this dude out no way an innocent man is going to prison on my watch no way i just kept thinking that i have to find this paperwork this dude s life depends on it finally i found the right box i actually did a woo hoo and danced around a bit i sure hope no one heard my shout of joy coming from the closet my joy wa soon squashed when i pulled out the paperwork and discovered he did not work that night he should have he wa na with a set schedule but he didn t work that night or the next i only had payroll so i couldn t say if he called in or no showed i only know he didn t work that night a he claimed i photocopied everything and gave the original to the cop month later mr x wa convicted of double murder he worked at the hotel for about month after he committed the murder before he quit to work at another hotel it took them year to figure out it wa him because the first time around no one bothered to check his alibi it took me day amp x b tl dr i spent day thinking i wa helping defend an innocent man but it turned out i wa helping to convict a murderer

hello again reddit it s me themagicstrugglebus i am so so glad people liked the beginning of the pathological liar susan saga i m glad you stuck out my pregnancy scatterbrained storytelling and i m sorry to tell you it will not get any better this part please read the first part if you haven t already because a lot of this story is interwoven with that part the first part wa to lay the groundwork of how she became pls but a lot of this part take place right a we were figuring this out about her gt i m writing this part after writing both the second and most of the third part of the saga detail have been coming back to me so i m trying to keep everything before i lose it i will keep this part a i had written it but i realize now for the future part i may need to change my tone when i wrote the first part and this second part i wa hellbent on making everyone see how unfair and insane this woman wa because i still feel slighted that i wa dragged into her insanity in true bardic fashion i wa more intent on making this story entertaining and funny maybe it s the mom coming out in me but i m realizing now the more i write that the story of pls is actually rather sad though it is more apparent in the next part than it is in this one lt gt in reality a crazy a this story is this is the story of a woman who wa failed by so many people maybe i m still bitter about the way this situation wa handled by my gm because a i hinted in the first part i wa not mentally equipped to handle someone with a many need a pls in my defense though what front desk customer service employee is it got to a point where i could scream no go away at the top of my lung and pls wouldn t listen to anyone either my gm should have stepped in sooner or i should have quit hindsight is however pls doe not deserve to be mocked because at her core this woman wa and is still sick and the people who should have helped her decided to drop her off at a hotel lt gt it is not a hotel s responsibility to take care of your sick family this could have all been avoided if her brother had taken her to receive care instead of sticking her at another hotel after she had already been kicked out of one for her behavior she needed someone to take care of her even if she didn t want it and it wasn t fair to anyone involved that she ended up here lt gt this entire story should serve a cautionary tale to hotel manager on how not to handle the mentally ill when it come to your hotel staff and to please take our cry seriously when we tell you a guest is a major problem lt i m so sorry the first part wa hard to read i m writing this on a google doc so i can start and stop it without losing my draft a more detail come to me i m hoping this part will be a little better edited in compliance with reddit formatting i also apologize for how all over the place the first part wa this story ha so many moving part that it make it hard to tell in a linear fashion that make any lick of sense it is by far easier to break it down into little chunk but unfortunately a lot of what happens in earlier moment come back later on and it make following along in any capacity a little hard to convey the baby hormone also have made me a tad scatterbrained and my grammar game isn t up to par i have a hard enough time verbally telling this story so writing it is even harder i thank you for bearing with me today i am going to impart part of the saga of pathological liar susan pls the story of pls her sick mother and her brother or the local mental hospital threatened pls with trespassing tl dr pls ha a weird breakfast routine emergency service will not talk to pls so pls ha front desk call to have her mother taken to a local mental hospital and receives threat to not trespass on hospital property in our first installment i told you all about how the first two week of pls stay started rather mild we hadn t really interacted with her until she started coming to u to ask for breakfast item for her sick mother it started with her belief that the milk we sold in our hotel shop tasted like vanilla honestly i can t tell you if she wa lying about this i thought it wa totally fine but one of my co worker agreed so after a couple of refund pls would ask for milk from the breakfast and if you gave pls milk she would want some cereal to go with it if you gave pls some cereal she would want some oatmeal to go with it if you have pls some oatmeal she d want you get the point her mother wa sick and breakfast food wa all the poor woman ate she claimed despite telling her a number of time that breakfast item could only be given during breakfast time and that a an extended stay property she had an entire kitchen to hold her own breakfast food she would beg her way to another milk the next night because her sick mother needed it the thing is pls also would take plate and plate of breakfast food down to her room at breakfast time this is a huge no no one plate to go is fine but she would take a plate and stack it full of muffin cover it and then grab another plate and stack it full of bagel she would do this until she grabbed a huge chunk of food from the buffet and would take multiple trip to her room with it we tried talking to her about it but she would tell u it wa for her sick mother my gm felt bad thinking that all the old woman could eat wa breakfast food so she would just let it go this went on for two week the thing is nobody knew if there even ever wa a sick mother at this time every time housekeeping would come to the room pls would turn them away at the door when we came to pas along a message she would never pick up her room phone she wouldn t even turn around to pas that message onto her mom she kept the door open only a crack and would stare directly at the messenger and shout the message into the air sighting of said sick mother wa minimal to non existent among the staff and most of u at the desk joked that there probably wasn t a sick mom and pls wa just looking for some free food pls also had a tiny foo foo dog with some obnoxious name i can t for the life of me remember what it wa all i can remember is despite many many threat pls refused to walk the dog in the lobby with a leash and would let it run around wild it would climb all over the furniture or try to explore the hotel and pls would screech it name at the top of her lung to command it to come back it would annoy all the guest at breakfast and we would get a lot of complaint from the room above the breakfast area because she would just shout at the dog at the top of her lung while she would grab half of the breakfast buffet eventually pls came to learn that i spent a lot of time alone and she began to make small talk with me during our give a pls a milk routine a i mentioned in the first part i thought she wa just some rich woman down on her luck and she just wanted someone to talk to she quickly latched onto me a someone she could trust and so one night after bringing her mom the milk and cereal she returned to the desk she talked with me the entire night even following me around when i went to deliver folio she stood in the doorway of the kitchen while i made coffee she sat directly next to me in the breakfast area while i ate my lunch she talked talked talked the night away and i wa happy to listen because most of my night are spent in silence i d occasionally get guest like this and most of the time they just have the one night and leave me be for the rest of the stay i talked with her for one night had a day off and returned for the next audit shift pls wa waiting like a vulture talking to my fdm on the afternoon shift when i walked in the door it wa a big ol hello for me and she stood silently while i worked with the fdm on passalongs and shift change he took me to the back office and gave an exhausted sigh she s been down here for an hour looking for you and she also came down last night and talked to other night auditor apparently you re friend now i told him she wa harmless and probably just lonely again i started getting all my shift prep together and pls stood silently a she watched the fdm leave she waited a minute and then she started talking to me with a distressed sigh i asked what wa wrong and pls told me her mother wa writing down kill the dog she showed me the paper her mother wa writing it on which wa covered in scribble and kill the dog which i now know with certainty pls wrote herself it wa her handwriting she wa worried that her mother wa going to hurt herself or someone else so she wanted to check her into the local mental hospital in the morning it kinda creeped me out that she asked me if i had ever been to one normal etiquette is do you know if there is one around here but i wrote down the number of one nearby on google she came back a few minute later and told me they weren t going to see the mother i didn t know what i wa supposed to do other than shrug my shoulder and say well maybe you can try again in the morning and talk to someone else i thought it wa strange that the hospital wouldn t take in someone who wa threatening the life of an animal pls huffed and returned to her room i had a brief few minute of peace before the house phone s emergency alarm started to go off i rushed to it to turn it off a it usually is someone who just accidentally dial while trying to dial out but i see the call came from pls room our emergency service dispatch call the hotel after every call to follow up a most call are hang ups so i quickly called the room and asked if everything wa alright pls i wanted to call but they told me they wouldn t talk to me me are you having an emergency pls no alright that s a little strange the other line started ringing and i put pls on hold to take it it wa the emergency dispatch they received a hang up call from the property and wanted to know if everything wa alright i explained that the woman who called had said nobody would talk to her and the dispatcher told me nobody spoke to her a it wa a hang up call i told her that i d find out more but since the guest had told me it wasn t an emergency i would direct the guest to the non emergency line i came back to pls from the hold me hey i m sorry that you were unable to talk to a dispatcher can i ask again if this is an emergency pls no no my mom s fine but she s telling me she s going to kill my dog and she s screaming at me me well that kind of sound like an emerg pls i m telling you it s not i have it under control she sounded incredibly stressed and on the verge of tear i didn t hear anything going on in the background behind her if the mother wa screaming she had gone silent me alright would you like the number for the non emergency service then it doesn t sound like everything is okay pls will you call them for me me i m not really supposed to because they will need some information from you about what s going on pls they already said they won t talk to me though i ll give you all the information you need please just call them for me she began to start pouring out information about her mother her full name birth date every medicine she took etc i started frantically writing it down not entirely sure what wa even going on but i d let the police handle it when they arrived i called the county s non emergency line and tried my best to explain what wa going on to the dispatcher he asked me why the guest couldn t call herself i told him that she had called hung up and then told me it wa not an emergency i also told him that i thought it wa strange because before the emergency dispatcher told me it wa a hang up call pls had told me she called and said nobody would talk to her he agreed that it wa a strange behavior and told me he would pas the information along to the officer a few minute later two squad car and an ambulance rolled up to the property one set of officer accompanied em to the room and the other stayed at the desk to talk to me one officer took down my information and had me explain everything i knew to him and a we were talking i see em roll an elderly woman out on a stretcher the mother looked calm collected and pls followed with that annoying little dog in tow a few minute later the officer i had spoken to returned inside and let me know that they believed the mother wa alright and did not appear to be making any threat but that they were going to take her in for an evaluation just in case he thanked me for calling apologized for the chaotic passing of information and left i wrote my incident report and got ready to run audit a few hour later i hear a knock on the desk pls had returned i didn t even get a chance to ask her if everything wa alright before she just began to start mile a minute talking again her mom had gotten to the hospital and had claimed that it wa not her that had written the note but that pls had written the note and that she felt unsafe pls went on a tangent about how her mother ha dementia and that she wa always trying to get pls in trouble the doctor doing the evaluation believed pls when she explained this to him and wa admitting the mother for a few day to calm her down once again i d like to reiterate that i m naive and believe that pls ha had no reason to really lie to me at this point i have family member who are mentally unwell and i know how exhausting it can be for family to handle someone like that later on when i wa making copy for her lawyer i would see that the handwriting she showed me on the note wa in fact written by pls the scribble and everything matched her s to a t there really is no good way to explain the next part because it wa periodic part of conversation so i will give you a tl dr version of what i heard in regard to the mother over the next few crazy week followed by statement the brother told the hotel later on during his call to our sale manager her mother hated the mental hospital and they were injecting her with drug for week on end she tried to visit the mother every day but after a week the mental hospital told her if she showed up again they would call the police on her she went back again and the police told her she would be charged with trespassing if she stepped foot on the property again the police ended up following her back to the hotel after this incident though they did not come with her inside she would come back every day from the hospital and tell the front desk about all the cruel thing they were doing to her mother and then at night she would come down in hysteric telling me about how the hospital must be experimenting on her mother she wa getting a lawyer to sue the hospital for holding her mother against her will according to her brother her mother wa only in the mental hospital for a day and wa moved to a care facility by the brother after finding out the mental hospital took her for the night for an eval and wa uncomfortable sending her back to the hotel with pls after she got in a verbal altercation with a nurse during the intake so they called her son to come pick the mother up pls hadn t been to visit the mother at the care facility and the brother had no idea where the outlandish claim that the mother wa being drugged by the mental hospital came from a for the trespassing threat he suspect though could not confirm that pls had been returning to the mental hospital looking for the mother and the hospital could not tell her where the mother had gone he made a point to tell u that this wasn t the first hospital she s been kicked out of in the area and that she d eventually stop going back there or would be taken in cuff this is when her brother revealed to u that she had been kicked out of another hotel down the street he began to raise hell with the sale manager about being charged for the room a apparently his intention wa to only pay for pls first night our system ha cleared out all the internal note so i cannot go back to confirm this but i don t believe this wa ever discussed at check in in fact if i recall he had even filed a credit card authorization form for the entire stay it turn out though that pls brother wa just a lawsuit happy a she wa and so our sale manager asked pls to pay for the night up to that point she gave u a card with the amount with no fight we only ever heard from the brother again in regard to picking up his mother s mail after pls had been kicked out and let u know what hotel she wa staying at bonus mini story in regard to the mom a day or so after the bar event from the previous part and the night her mother left pls brought me down a pair of black seamless thong panty unworn with tag and said her mother wanted me to have them i tried to give them back to her because giving a thong to a stranger is super weird but she refused to take them back she left them at the desk for me and returned to her room i couldn t leave a thong on the desk so i put them in a ziploc bag and taped it to my gm s door with a note about who had given them to me my gm thought it wa hilarious i did not thanks for tuning in to another part about pls i apologize this one isn t nearly a tantalizing a the last part nor do i have any witty one liner about waste processing plant or what not there is a lot of mystery in regard to pls and the mental hospital that i don t think we ll ever get the answer but i can tell you that i can understand why the facility may have been wary of committing her pls wa lawsuit happy and not afraid to vocalize how happy she would be to sue the pant off you i ll get more into that in the next part because pls and her supposed team of lawyer is a whole other basket of worm the saga of pathological liar susan will continue in the story of pls her lawyer and lawsuit galore or why i believe i m qualified to work at staple copy center
i came in today with a severe cold and am really trying to keep it together my hour were cut short because of the holiday so i didn t want to call out today and no one would have been able to take my shift anyway this is a problem that happens frequently but today of all day it affect me the most people just do not listen when i tell them thing during check in they ll ask me to repeat myself or time or call from the room to ask something i already told them it absolutely infuriating the worst one is telling them about our parking it s a private parking structure beneath the hotel so it admittedly can be a little confusing but it make me want to pull my hair out and scream when i tell someone a plainly a possible how to park and all they do is look at me with some stupid look on their face like i just spoke another language then i ll have to repeat myself giving the exact same explanation mind you until they finally just get in their car and try it it s frustrating because people expect to be able to visualize the parking in their head before they go out out there which isn t realistic the more i explain it the more confusing it get i can barely stand up or speak today so i might explode next time someone asks me to needlessly repeat myself because they re too stupid to listen the first time i realize this is probably just my cold talking and i m probably being a little unfair i get people have long car ride and are exhausted by the time they get here it s still annoying though
when i eat out alone i usually prefer sitting at a person table because i like having more space and my bag next to me of course i only do this when the restaurant is mostly empty yesterday though i went to a caf and it wa literally just me so i took a person table i didn t really think anything of it but one of the server came right up and asked me to move to a two seater so i m wondering have i always just gotten off easy by taking larger table doe it take noticeably more work to clean up a x larger table
so this is two story of how yesterday can go and fuck itself long dick style i m the assistant manager for a high end restaurant in a tourist area winter suck summer are busy and make you want to kill yourself summer it s a head ship winter it s a skeleton crew so i m also the host takeout guy phone answerer keg changer magician very nice person call looking to reserve i m halfway through writing down their information while on the phone when entitled bastard and wife come in he march right past the host stand with the menu ignores me a his wife enters the restroom and loudly say i ll go find u a table i apologise to the person on the phone place them on hold and go to catch this guy excuse me sir one moment please i need to check you in and seat you yeah well you ignored u sir i m on the phone taking a reservation so a phone call take priority over a walk in the guy is screaming at me at this point both server hear it well sir we typically get to guest in the order of contact if this person had called a you entered i would have asked them to hold but a i wa halfway through confirming the reservation finishing that would have taken le time and still had you seated so you re going to ignore someone in front of you for the phone at this point i know my bos would absolutely back me on kicking him out i could probably get away with telling him to fuck himself sideways but it s winter my server need tip so i swallow it down i tell him i ll get him a table and seat the smug fuck who proceeds to tip both server were pissed and it took all of my restraint not to ask the kitchen to waiting this bastard a for the title the kitchen is doing water glass instead of placing tray side by side they place tray of glass like a goddamn cake dirty tray bottom on lip of glass so knowing how disgusting that is i take them back to the kitchen tell the chef they need to redo these tray and they know damn well they can t stack tray the chef is tired i m tired yelling begings again the glass is clean look at it yes but the part you put your mouth on wa touched by the bottom of the goddamn tray pah is fine no problem oh if it s so fine then you fucking eat something off the bottom of the tray i turned away threw the glass into the dish bin we don t have time if you so worried you do it so i laughed i laughed in his face nah and walked away and that lady and gentleman is why everyone here hate me
this just happened a little while ago i work at a historic hotel and we are by far the nicest hotel in the area but there are far cheaper read dirtier hotel within pretty close proximity a woman came in asking if we were busy a a few select date in the upcoming month i informed her that we had opening for those day and were almost completely empty she is in a band and the band ha a lot of member the band will be playing in the bar that is directly next door to u physically attached but a separate entity than our company she heard that we often offer discount to the band if we have opening and we do in the winter because we can in the summer we are too busy i offer her a deal of taking a few suite for usd which is about le than their normal price she book three room each day but then say that she wa hoping that i d be generous and give her a couple free room i said i couldn t really justify that she said if the room were empty anyway it shouldn t be that big of a deal i told her i have a staff to pay and utility that need to be covered and i already gave her a deal when i didn t need to she say that i could give her a better deal i just didn t want to i remind her that i could rescind the deal oh nononono you don t have to do that just thought i d ask after a volley of more question she say that the bar is only paying them so much so they could only afford so much she asks once more for at least one free room a night i tell her that i have no incentive to give her a free room and again i already gave you a heavy discount that i originally offered without prompting also we are close to other hotel that average nightly rate run she settled for just adding a cot to some of the room to fulfill the bed she needed i put a note on her folio that she might try to weasel her way out of paying or getting free room amp x b edit i can t figure out how to crosspost to r choosingbeggars
saturday i had a four top of young military member the fact that they were in the military wa obvious from their clothing serving them wa uneventful and extremely easy they even pre ordered dessert with the meal most people spend around a piece when eating at our restaurant and so i asked the manager to preemptively add a military discount to each check the end result two of the four guy stiffed me outright and the other two left five percent tip on their check i cannot say that this is an unusual outcome most military member seemingly never even tip the saving most rarely acknowledge the discount even when they didn t ask for it while i can possibly excuse this behavior because of age or lack of income the behavior seems to continue a these people get older military spouse in my experience seem to exhibit some of the most karen esque behavior while their husband generally throw down their amex platinum card to pay for check with an accompanying tip military table could be my least favorite type of table to serve

my nice quiet night turned into a shit storm when the fire alarm went off at in the morning every guest in the hotel got a nice wake up call i know this suck for everyone but it s common sense to gtfo of a place when the fire alarm go off common sense isn t so common some guest called the front desk while i wa getting thing together to check the hall and help guest out if they needed it do i need to leave my room is it a real fire i don t know and yes please leave the room and building seriously a i m coming back down i see some half dressed woman step out of her room and yell to her dad inside it s a false alarm go back to bed i stop her before she go back into the room and say that no one is for sure if it s a false alarm or not until the fire department arrives until then you need to evacuate wtf i get back to the lobby only to find most of the guest sitting in the lobby and a few standing outside fuck it let s compromise they don t have to stand outside in the cold and you can all give me the stink eye until the fire department arrives a if i pulled the fire alarm just for shit and giggle the fire department finally arrives they check all floor only to find notta fire panel say the alarm tripped on the rd floor that entire floor is vacant due to renovation so a contractor probably fucked up at some point or maybe it s something else i don t know i just want to leave before the next shit storm hit that being guest waking up again and complaining about the false alarm good time edit spelling

so skipping the bullshit this day went to hell when i only got hour of sleep but i bought coffee in preparation i get on shift clock in and then i am made aware of guest in the lobby they paid for the ufc fight tonight and we re quite loud i shake it off though if i don t get a call from a guest complaining about them i don t intervene unless they break other rule but their distraction give me a headache and for whatever reason the coffee just taste bland terrible so that s just great coffee is not drinkable for my shift and all i have to combat the sleepiness is splashing water on my face occasionally we were busy today many group had kid and one so happened to slip and fall into the pool scaring the shit out of me and their sibling parent it wa nasty but not serious i handed away our first aid kit and everything s been fine also everyone love buying shit that equal up to a few dollar and some change we are fresh out of all change not even a damn penny i also had to hand out receipt of them and they require being folded into third the only saving grace is that breakfast is pretty simple and easy to make lucky me this wa the worst possible combination of circumstance for me to have to deal with on this shift about six more hour until the shift end
i ve been looking for serving job in my college town all year with no luck and i m starting to wonder if i m doing something wrong for background i ve served full time at two different restaurant in my home town for the last three summer summer are month one of those restaurant being a busy well known chain across the street from a major amusement park i used to work fast food in my college town but this year i got to the point where i had enough in saving to not have to work during the school year and i no longer found minimum wage worth my time in a way i figured it would be relatively easy to find a serving job with my experience and i wa completely fine with having to host or food run for a few month if i needed to first i applied to a bunch of place in person on their website and on indeed and have had a few interview over the last month or so but none have ended with a job offer the last interview i had ended with the manager saying he d recommend me to the gm for a second interview and that i needed to call her myself in a few day to schedule it call the gm get told that they re still doing interview and that they ll call me by the end of the week and nothing so restaurant manager what sort of thing could i be doing wrong that would keep me from getting hired despite having the necessary experience are there any big no no on what to say that you commonly encounter is this just bad luck i ve left nearly all my interview feeling confident so i can t really see what i m doing wrong but clearly there s something i only have class three day a week and only in the morning a well so i doubt it s my availability

good evening lovely denizen of the desk are you comfortable did you do all your check in good then let me tell you about a guest who got reverse uno d by the policy he wa attempting to invoke from the dredge of the policy manual like some cult leader trying to raise some all powerful undead god only for it to backfire in his face our story begin with of course an entitled guest at a hotel too damn small for a person of this shiny top tier status with big title come bigger entitlement he s been here so long i ve seen his hair measurably grow for reference of how long this guy ha been here now being a top tier with no end date in sight for his check out he get real comfortable doe all the annoying but relatively harmless stuff that kyle karen guest do say he know the policy but then fight me on everything to house keeping policy point awarded to his account the check out time our current story everything the thing about this guy and how unpredictable he is come from the fact that he check out and almost immediately check back in he say he s here for work but he s in the room all day i suppose it s computer work but still it look like reward farming to me oh well not my worry then the day finally come that this guy is going home and look not another duplicate reservation made at in the morning my lucky day of course he call to push his late check out past the actual time it s supposed to go he try to request an extra minute sorry no can do i reply into my telephone with a forced smile max check out is pm hour after our standard check out thank you housekeeper gotta leave this is a small hotel we don t have hr service you know you really don t know the policy he informs me with an exasperated sigh a a redacted level member i can have redacted help line call and give me my hour stay you can t force me out i blink a little hour huh you wanna play hard ball with me over minute okay smart as i ll show you the policy of course i reply congenially you re more than welcome to call the redacted line and request the same time to check out a your check in time let me see your last check in oh i see you checked in two week ago at a m top tier shiny member we love you so damn much we let you check out and check right back into the same room every single time you wanna extend your stay we re kind we don t have to let you do these early check in but you give u such headache by trying to force late check out that we just do it at breakfast for you so that you don t have attitude with u or the poor housekeeper and now you ve tried to one up me without even checking your hand you absolute buffoon so unfortunately from the time you checked into your room from your last stay ha already passed i say i can offer the max o clock check out after that it ll be a day charge of half your daily rate we do apolo oh he hung up congratulation you played yourself
this will be blissfully short apology for mobile etc etc i m a night auditor somewhere in the middle of nebraska and tonight i learned that third party company can time travel it s approximately local time when this happens i ve just finished running audit and sat down to do the mathematical and hand accounting portion of the packet when i hear the tell tale sound of our fax machine i think it s a little odd but that it s probably either spam or a tpi for the coming night until the phone ring and my spidey sens start tingling on the phone is a guest who had just booked a room through a tpi for the night i had just finished closing out i m flabbergasted i explain to the guest that i can t even honor the reservation that the tpi made because the business day is closed our system won t allow it and the tpi likely wouldn t actually pay u for the room because the date would be wrong she call them get a refund and call me back to arrange to do a walk in day use room when she arrives no big deal i walk in back to check the fax that started all of this and sure enough plain a day it say check in check out reservation made am pst so about local time about minute after my audit had finished running do you think they d let me borrow their tardis
if so what do you do amp how refreshing or exhausting is it to get a paycheck
i used to work a night auditor back while i wa still in university and i don t know if other people in the industry made the same experience a me but i had more crazy people to deal with than the morning or late shift the city i studied and worked in ha a few hundred thousand inhabitant but lot of tourism in summer partially because of a big festival with different production having performance in the city s theater the opera and even on an open air stage if the weather wa good the festival last two month from early juli until the end of august in that time i regularly had the weirdest people come in to be fair i got a lot of weirdoes and crazy the rest of the year too but it wa worst in summer i don t know if where you are there exists a similar saying if it rain it pours one night i didn t get just one crazy person or two but all of them at least that is what it felt like first there wa the crazy lady who always turned up during the festival i had guest complaining left and right because she would stand on the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street and look into the mirror a shop there had in it window tell herself how pretty she wa and then come midnight she would start singing opera tune at the top of her lung we had her each year but that night that wa just the first crazy person like always i called the cop and they told her to go away because i already knew she wouldn t leave until the cop told her to next wa the escort a guest had brought back and thought she could make another quick buck by offering to service me yeah that is exactly what i need a prostitute who just had sex with someone else prostitution is legal in my country then there wa a cat lady she arrived at am she had called me hysterically where the hotel wa because she couldn t follow google map then when she wa at the hotel i had to console her because she wa afraid she would go to jail because a cop had stopped her going the wrong direction on a one way street and fined her the hotel is only reachable by a series of one way street after i checked her in she unloaded her car she wa in town for day and had brought along her cat the hotel allowed cat and dog for extra fee but not only did she bring along her cat but also a man sized cat scratching post her cat s toilet and two suitcase full of cat toy she lugged up to the room then she drove her car to the parking garage which is literally around the corner and did not come back for an hour because she couldn t find the m back to the hotel without meeting a good samaritan to direct her back to the hotel after having wandered in circle for nearly minute then the i work here lady showed up she wa a regular an old woman who wa confused and had once worked in the hotel she always insisted to be then led to the kitchen because it wa her first day of work if left alone she would go away though after being ignored for a while then came the drunk russian he couldn t tell me his name anymore and i don t speak a lick of russian but after some difficulty i found out his room min later his cab driver came in drunk russian had told him to wait he would get money from the room so then i had to wake up the drunk russian because he had already gone to bed after another min and phone call to the room he finally came down wearing only his boxer and the blanket like a cape he had sobered up somewhat and with a mix of english and pantomime i managed to translate for the cab driver who spoke no english the russian s card wasn t working so i managed to broker an agreement the russian would leave payment with the front desk and the cab driver would collect it the next day after the russian had some time to get some money wired the money did never get picked up in the end despite the russian having left it so after a month we got it a a tip then the opera lady wa back outside singing called the cop again and a a conclusion i got drunk beggar they weren t beggar they just were drunk and insisted i give them a room for free because the night wa nearly over and so they wouldn t even use the room for the night it took a solid minute of arguing to get them out the door anyone else had any similar experience of just one weird person after the next walking in
this wa at a temporary job in a coffee shop where we sold coffee duh a well a ice cream and some snack apart from regular coffee we also served coffee with a scoop of ice cream all good except the ice cream flavour were a bit out there carrot cake panna cotta blueberry muffin and so on unconventional but still tasty then there were the really bad one such a honey rosemary sourcream which might go with roast potato but the flavour doe not translate well into ice cream and the hero or villain of this story black friday the feeling retail worker get on that day that s pretty much how it tasted supposedly it wa coconut and liquorice flavoured the closest i can come to describing the flavour is a coconut having a nightmare falling down a chimney straight into hell just to crawl out of there and onto an ice cream cone anyway it wa dark and therefore looked vaguely like another flavour we had dark chocolate and a lot of curious customer had asked about it i had been warning people away from the flavour for the whole week letting them sample it before they ordered and so on nobody actually bought it after tasting it perhaps i shouldn t have talked about company product that way but it wa my last week and i wa honestly done they had cut my hour to save money but still expected my to spend three hour a day commuting and their stinginess with equipment actually lead to injury of long term worker selling le ice cream wa the least of what they deserved cue the interaction with the unfortunate customer uc he walk in suit and briefcase i frequently got moved between different location and this particular shop wa prone to customer who would treat u in the what do you know you re only a barista way never mind that they knew le about coffee than most ten year old yes coffee doe get cold when you let it stand for ten minute that s not my fault not the point here though this man already looked the type but regardless you greet customer with a smile me hello what would you like today uc i ll take a cappuccino with a scoop of the dark chocolate ice cream we didn t have dark chocolate only black friday me sir that isn t dark ch uc black friday then who care about the name me are you sure it doesn t taste like chocolate so uc yes just put it in me thinking i d try one last time are you sure you don t want to taste it first this flavour doesn t really taste all that great uc i m sure okay then his money he is wasting not mine i make the coffee and drop in an extra large scoop of black friday i do after all want to make sure he get his money worth besides there s still ton of ice cream left and we have to chuck it out at the end of the week me here you go have a lovely day he take his coffee grumble and walk out now fortunately our shop ha glass door or i wouldn t have seen his priceless expression a he took his first sip i finished working there two day later put his face will remain a fond memory generally there is a reason someone warns you away from something tl dr customer want a disgusting ice cream flavour in his coffee against advice regret it
when someone say didn t i order this instead of this sometimes i def make mistake sometimes i know i put something in wrong but then there are those time when you just know they said chicken and you put in chicken and they try to make you feel like you fucked up sure maybe she thought she said shrimp but don t say it in a tone where you re putting the blame on me ugh irks me
yesterday we had a discussion about customer trying to get away with stealing food and being sneaky we are a coffee shop cafeteria inside a hospital we have a self serve breakfast bar and people like to hide sausage patty under their scrambled egg or hide hash brown on their breakfast sandwich you can t make this shit up so we decided the best course of action wa to put a sign at both cash register you must open your box at the register i literally had a customer laugh in my face and say you know people wouldn t feel the need to steal if y all didn t jack up the price that s like saying why make law if i m just going to break them i stared at her blankly and responded i m pretty sure people stealing stuff is their own fault don t be a sneaky jerk and we won t have any problem and just today my coworker asked a sassy regular to open her box and she looked right at her and said fuck you to which my coworker replied with a shocked look on her face i don t want to get written up for this just open your box sassy regular said i ll go somewhere else for lunch then if that s how it s going to be it s literally nothing personal lady if you aren t being sneaky and trying to steal food you should have absolutely no problem with opening your box
hello front desk friendos i ve got a little time to kill and am feeling sentimental so i thought i would vent a little about the room the break my heart i know i ve touched on the family member who drop off their unwell sibling parent before you know the one who require assistance and training that we do not have a front desk folk but this is a different kind of sad it s time to talk about kid a lot of the most tragic story i ve experienced in my hotel career involve kid and their pathetic excuse for parent let s talk about dejected dad or dd for short when i started working at my current location i wa told that dd wa on our dnr list no one really explained why but told me to not let them stay if they booked with u a few month pas and a trainee accidentally check in dd who booked through crooking com i then find out why they are dnr dd book a standard room with two queen bed and then pile his five child into the room these kid are between the age of toddler and around twelve year old he then leaf them completely alone in the room while he go to work ha dinner run errand and just generally isn t present let me reiterate the oldest child in this room with four other child is only twelve year old our staff had no idea this wa happening until housekeeping started complaining about the state of the room after check out it wa of course one of the filthiest room i have ever seen in my life you see dd would go to walmart and buy bag of junk food leaving it in the room for them to eat while he wa away cheetos in the air conditioner jello smeared across every surface chip ground into the carpet etc because you know they re without supervision we re pretty sure he didn t even stay in the room still make my blood boil we finally caught on that they were by themselves when someone checking due out said that the twelve year old would come to the door when they knocked dd ha a nasty habit prior dnr of making housekeeping force them to come down after check out to extend the twelve year old would then lie to the housekeeper poor darling and say my dad will be back in a few minute we would call the dad and he would come in from outside the building and renew the reservation we then realized that he wa leaving the child by themselves management decided they could not stay here anymore and they left well our dnr system is basically a note we keep on the desk onquerty doesn t have a feature to block reservation and even if it did they book through crooking com to avoid this regardless and a few month later he got checked back in somehow i wa executive housekeeper at the time learning all department and this time i had a chance to talk to him while forcing him to check out dude straight up told me that they were alone because their mom wa crazy and he didn t feel safe leaving them with her he said he still had to work and no one could watch them he said that the mom had custody but he would have to come take them away sometimes because the mom would be having an episode he didn t have room for them at his house so he kept them here did i also mention that this wa during the school year we never saw him take those kid to school not once guy what what do you even say to that credit where credit is due for removing your child from a dangerous situation but keeping them cooped in a tiny hotel room unattended for long period of time is also a form of child abuse i honestly didn t know what to say i told him that management determined that they could not stay with u and that he may want to look into child protection he shrugged and they left i haven t seen them for almost a year but it break my heart every time i think about it anyone else have a situation like this one
either last weekend or the weekend before when i presented the check to one of my table which had a mom with or of her daughter who looked to be no older than the mom just casually glanced at the check then handed it to her eldest daughter here sweetie you pay the daughter took the check from her mom and said in a very important sounding tone ok and pretended to look over the bill then she passed it to her sister lol eventually it made it back to the mom who actually paid but it wa hilarious to see another time i had a large party where the adult were sat at one table and all the kid were sat at another table because we didn t have a table large enough to accommodate them it wa explained to me at the beginning that they would all be on one check when i combined the two table check together and put the combined check at the adult table one of the dad joked that his daughter had money in her overall she looked no older than and could pay her table s own bill of course they put a card down for me to run after joking about it table like these are so fun

a simple story with a weird ending for some weekend chillin starting monday u folk at the desk will be making cooky since we have a hard time trusting the kitchen to do it right often not making enough and causing guest to bitch at u for not having a cookie for them or forgetting to make them all together today they fucked up twice the first batch wa too small and burnt the cooky were tough and the guest that had them weren t fan but we put them out anyways until we could remedy the situation the second batch seems to have initially been a great batch soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside an overall beautiful cookie but the kitchen waited too long to bring them and by the time they got here the cooky had fuzed in the box creating a cookie brick we can t give this to guest and that brings me to now sitting in the back office slowly chipping away at a brick of chocolate chip cooky with a fork it s beautiful a truly transcendent experience and i m sure i m going to have a headache later from all the sugar
okay so i haven t been in the hospitality industry long i also work at a very budget brand hotel i like to think it s decent i feel like your getting good value for the rate currently how high our nightly rate go in the summer is ridiculous idk why anyone would pay that so we had our quality audit today i don t know how common that is in different hotel but i would assume it s standard someone coming and inspecting the condition of the room your renting well there are a few thing that if they are messed up you instantly fail your audit obvious stuff like the door lock have to function no exposed wiring fire alarm window lock etc very obvious stuff that if you don t have it s a safety and security issue they also check that your fd is knowledgeable about the area very simple stuff we failed all because one room which wa not supposed to be rentable had a busted door latch this is something we all knew about and wa supposed to be in the system a unrentable but for some reason wa not so of course everybody started throwing the blame on different direction i am the mod so i shit all that down said the blame wasn t on anyone except for me and the gm the rest of the audit wa great the auditor even said we had the cleanest room of any in our region that our fd absolutely demolished all the attempt to trip her up we did phenomenal but that doesn t matter because we failed obviously i m bummed i spent hour at the hotel last night making last minute attempt to clean and somehow between me my gm my hhk and maintenance we missed this we re not gonna let it bring u down and we re only gonna improve but of course it ruined my day and i wa fortunate enough to have to work the evening shift and it went horribly a guest that stayed last night came in demanding a refund because the room smelled bad and wasn t cleaned i asked the very simple did you inform staff last night and got the i shouldn t have to inform staff i m telling you the room wa bad and the customer is always right and i hit him with the sorry to hear that unfortunately this is a hotel you are not a customer you are a guest there s a big difference and went through that whole thing basically told him to take his tweaker as off my property a nicely a possible if there s a problem with a room i give people an hour which our policy is min if he woulda said something at any point anyone would have moved him to a new room it s winter we got room for day then right when i wa ready to end shift my na ha literally walked into the lobby i get hit up by karen we haven t received housekeeping at all during our stay i m so sorry ma am let me look into it for you oh it look like my housekeeper tried to get in to service but your husband had told them no service you dirty freaking lier no one been to our room my husband wouldn t have turned it away this place is fight i m calling corporate and i will be getting a refund ok there number is right there on the wall have a good night and i started printing off my end shift paperwork are you really gonna ignore me now i m sorry i thought we were done i assumed you just wanted the corporate number what else can i do for you i want your name literally wearing a jacket with my name on it my name tag on the opposite side of said jacket and a big old sign right behind me with my name manager on duty i ll give you my card anything else i want your manager name i ll give you his card anything else yeah i want my refund call corporate i really like working in this industry but good god i hate this place i m at everyday there at least one b thing that s gotta happen i m sick of it

why do we yell opa when someone drop a plate or we break glass i ve just always done it and never understood the tradition i m betting a quick google search would answer my question but i love the discussion on here
this is a minor gripe in the grand scheme of thing but i ve been in the service industry for almost year now and in that time i have only ever worked at place that serve coke product restaurant bar catering company sporting event you name it coke last year my current job made a huge switch and gave pepsi pouring right for the first time ever and it s not until you serve pepsi that you realize that nearly of people ask for coke by default even people who actually prefer pepsi and because of this every time someone order with me i have to follow up with is pepsi ok even with people who are there all the time even people who i have literally served that night like they ll ask for coke i ll ask if pepsi is ok they ll say yes and then come up and say can i have more coke but i still have to ask every time because occasionally you do get the person who claim not to like pepsi and will order something else
okay i don t work at a car rental agency so we help guest rent motorbike and car at the hotel but we are only the middle man they pay cash to the rental company for some reason the rental company carelessly didn t check how much fuel wa in the tank and it wa literally running on fume the moped ran out in the middle of the mountainous dark road between town and the hotel two american they were hispanic not the entitled type we normally see thankfully came to u to complain about what happened to them and it s simply unacceptable turn out the previous renter didn t bother to fill up the tank and the rental company didn t even bother to check if there s fuel in the tank nightmare for the guest the company ha apologised but here s one for you tourist if you re visiting somewhere and renting motorbike fill up your tank before returning like a normal human

so i heard this guy came in to the hotel and only booked with u today paid in full for a week this guy like the title state is at reception currently he s listening to music and singing more like talking the lyric out loud he ha given me a minute lecture about the recent incident in my town which involved an attack to add to that note the victim of the said incident were apparently on a week coma which he also went through he s also pointed out to me that after i give birth i ll also be in a week induced coma after that he asked me about the name of my baby noting that i should hurry and choose because it s definitely a boy but if it s a girl that s okay too more to add later on his current tirade edit spelling amp grammar
another freaking flight crew once again they are at the wrong hotel and giving me attitude over their mistake how freaking hard is it to read the itinerary and direct the uber drive to the correct address surely the company booking their stay didn t just give them a hotel name and send them on an easter egg hunt there s of them of each and the one dude saunter in and tell me they are here to check in and that the reservation wa just made i knew this to not be the case because we are sold out plus inventory wa nmq so ain t now reservation getting through to oversell me i thought perhaps that they made a reservation for the next night thinking they could check in now y all know how that go but it turn out like it did in a previous post of mine about flight crew that they needed to be at the same hotel a before that is minute away in another part of town this flight crew looked wiped out i felt kind of bad for them but not by much because they were still grim awkward and completely rude it s not my fault you don t know how to read an itin e rary the male flight attendant is taking business card and writing thing down a if he is keeping track of some shit but if he could keep track of shit he would be in his hotel room right now taking a shit and not giving me shit in my hotel i remember what happened the last time and tell them that they are probably supposed to be at the other hotel and tell them the address and they stare at me a if i just spoke dothraki the lead guy put in his airpods eyeroll and start making call i stand there delighted that they aren t staying with me when the lead guy asks me if the address he ha written down wa correct i tell him yes that s the address i gave you a few minute ago i literally had given him that address before he put in his airpods to ignore me and make phone call mmmkay so we have it sorted out where they are to really be staying they are now on their way yes nope they sit in my lobby awkwardly for another minute what the hell i told them where the restroom were in case they wanted to freshen up then just walked to the back and sat down this is crazy awkward they hadn t even called an uber yet the other guy of the group wa just standing tall in the middle of my freaking lobby and the two woman were seated and one of them wa sitting wide legged with a skirt on lol i shit you not i will say that this group wasn t a dickish a the other flight crew i posted about this one wa awkward and looked ran through and i m taking into account that they were probably a tired a they looked a a reason for the sour disposition i get it but flight crew man get it together lol
this is my first post here and i have hundred of story tell so if this get popular i will definitely tell more just for some clarification i m a hostess and a waitress on this night i happened to be just hosting i just sit people and clean the common area and check people out when they re done it wa a monday which is our kid eat free night it s about an hour before close and we had just finished a big rush almost no table were clean and our wait staff were trying to catch up me me mg mean guy this guy come in and i rush to the front to greet him i wa in the middle of taking a water break but i still had to keep my eye on the door through this little window a i m walking toward him he walk away and start looking at the salad bar so i wait for him menu in hand he proceeds to try to walk past me towards an area that hadn t been cleaned yet so i stop him and the conversation go a little something like this me excuse me do you need to be seated mg yeah i need a booth me cool we have plenty of booth that are clean back this way that are close to the salad bar if you don t mind following me i take him to a different part of the restaurant and try to sit him in a clean booth with a server that s le busy mg why do i have to sit there me oh i m sorry i can seat you somewhere different but it s going to be a little farther away he doesn t say anything so i start walking toward the next clean section and i try to sit him at another clean booth he take one look at me and then the table he doesn t exactly yell but he did raise his voice in an angry way mg i don t want to godamn sit there me im taken aback because this guy just get angry out of nowhere i m sorry wa there a specific seat you wanted mg i just don t want to sit there my goddamn foot hurt you know what fuck it he leaf but not before shouting at my coworker who wa at the front cashing out one of his table i just kind of stood there for a moment then when back to what i wa doing people get mad at me all the time for not giving them the right seat in retrospect i probably could have cleaned off one of the table he wa heading towards but i had a line at the register and more people waiting to be seated behind him some night you just can t win
me and my buddy went out to eat and got separate check and both of u put in our card and then got caught up in our conversation the waitress come and take our check without u writing in a tip or signing she come back and say to have a good night and walk away we realize that we didn t tip zero out or sign we didn t have any cash to leave and didn t mean to stiff her i am planning on calling tomorrow to see when she work again to maybe drop by and leave a few buck check wa only like i usually feel terrible about this kind of thing and legitimately lose sleep over it would a server recognize the accident or could it legitimately ruin a night how bad should we feel about it
i hadn t planned on continuing this rant but there wa quite a few interested and thing just keep snowballing on their way down hill so i ended up having more info so to quickly recap the most pressing matter kaitlyn ha begun making a habit of keeping worker guest who check out early in the system for the rest of their originally stated stay charging them for day they aren t there last post i stated that to my knowledge while she tried this with a room booking and a room booking no one heard actually been over charged turn out i wa incorrect the room booking wa charged for an extra day not only the two that didn t come to the front desk to check out but the one i personally checked out a well they did not receive their refund and not only that but the room block that i personally checked out the day they left a day before their original scheduled departure a they had finished their job kaitlyn went ahead and charged them for the additional day but for that i have proof i went up there to chat on my day off and wa told what she had done so i printed each of the folio off showing the charge made when i checked them out a well a the additional charge made the next day kaitlyn hasn t said anything to me but she did ask matilda the worker on shift with her who had checked them out matilda shrugged and kaitlyn went ahead and posted another payment but this is a real fuck up for her if she just keep the room checked in then it doesn t really look suspicious like she did with the but with the twelve where i checked them out and charged them there is a clear division between them being charged for when they stayed v the additional time im not sure what to do with this evidence or where to take it a i m new to the whole whistleblowing thing but this shit is all kind of wrong and greedily chewing on the hand of the largest company to feed this hotel she s risking year of continual income for week worth of stay for single day not to mention the existence of the very business and all our job on the earlier part with the bizarre family drama bleeding into the workplace not much to be said thankfully ophelia and the rest of matilda s family in housekeeping chose not to come to the christmas lunch though a good time wa had by the rest of u
a couple of year ago i wa fom of a room full service hotel it wa after i wa gm at a small room hotel same ownership company it wa the middle of the day when an older man approached the front desk he asked where the man making suit wa i inform him we don t have a tailor on staff or in the building he show me a flyer there is a company doing fitting and making custom suit at the hotel for day so i bring the flyer our sale manager i didn t see anything on the beo s and sometimes they would add last minute thing i wasn t there for our morning stand up and wa helping another guest when we had our opps sale meeting for the week figured i just missed it my sale manager didn t have a clue what i wa asking her i called the number on the flyer he wa in a room on the top floor i pull up his reservation detail he s here on an employee rate he somehow managed to get an upgrade to the top floor a a gold member on an employee rate i did have a conversation with the desk clerk that checked him in he wa very instantiate about being upgraded i go up to his room to talk with him when i asked what he doe at his hotel he snarky said he doesn t work at a hotel well that pissed me off i inform him that employee rate room are not for business travel and that they are for employee of hotel that he might be better suited for a a friend and family rate i also give him the option of staying that night at our best flex rate for that room and also for the last two night or he would need to leave in five minute i also informed him that it a full service hotel and we have meeting room that would be more than adequate for his need he agrees to the rate adjustment amp x b i then emailed my franchise support specialist and the franchise employee rate fraud team with the detail i also called the hotel on the flyer he had three more hotel in the next couple week where he wa selling suit all at the employee rate the other hotel promptly cancelled his reservation

hey everyone tonight is my second to last shift at my hotel before i take a sabbatical for month to travel a bit so i thought i d share a story i ve been sitting on for maybe year unsure of if i should share it so anyways here s the story of how we most likely had an american spy in our hotel in iceland so about two year ago an american man come and check in seems normal no fuss stay is for like or day the first night we notice he s a bit of a talker when drunk at least and wa talking to myself and my colleague around or at night about how he s traveled all over the world he mention that he s been in north korea time my colleague asks him why he s been there so many time and responds with uuuuh because my mother s a wh re alright next night he come back a bit drunk again but wounded bruised and bleeding from his face and explains that he wa attacked outside a bar while he wa just smoking i enjoy a skirmish every now and then but the guy just sucker punched me hmm alright here s some bandage and antiseptic from our first aid kit off to bed he go i then finish my week and i m off but i hear later that the next night my other colleague saw him come in very drunk close to am a little bit later one of my colleague go for the regular security walk around the building to make sure everything is ok and find the man passed out drunk on the th floor she request the assistance of the other night auditor to try and help him to his room after some poking he wake up slightly but he cannot remember his room number fine that happens they ask him for his name in order to look up his room number in the system aaand he doesn t remember he doe not remember his own name after a couple of minute of poking him awake over and over they finally get his name and with it look up his room number he can t walk they have to physically drag him into his room and lay him down on the bed where he instantly pass out again a they turn around to leave they notice that on the table in the room there are different passport all of different nationality and different name all have his photo a stack of dollar bill a stack of british pound and a stack of euro a well a an american concealed carry weapon license under his american passport name that wa on the reservation perhaps prying wa a bit unethical but it wa just too peculiar seeing all this on the table there are no more incident until he leaf a far a i can remember so this guy wa either some sort of criminal or the world worst spy i say worst spy because well let s it slip that he s been to north korea many time and ha a terrible excuse for it come in bruised and bloody after a night out leaf fake passport and stack of cash on the table when there is a safe in the room get so drunk he forgets which cover he s using so yeah i m not sure what exactly he wa but a terrible spy is my guess no idea what he wa doing in iceland though

some quick backstory i work at a server at a place that may or may not sell mainly large round thing consumed frequently at friday night but i m not just serving there server take call seat people cash people out help run drive through take order serve table bus table along with a few odd thing done later on clean bathroom restock clean counter etc i love this job i love interacting with the kid that people bring in seeing the odd order people make seeing whatever random dog someone brought in their car with them it s great what s not so great are a few of my higher ups we have four manager and one even higher up manager two of our regular manager are pretty chill and our higher up manager is also great he ll take table if we get swamped make drink seat people take call etc the other two manager well they re not my favorite people in the world on with the story friday night tend to be very busy this wa my second friday night since valentine day which is a whole other story and beyond awful for my third day at work but luckily we didn t have too many table the few hour i wa working call however were going off the hook first section we get in wa a group of six no big deal biggest inconvenience wa two people waiting on an order were sitting at our only top our third server wasn t there and my section is that top booth only so i seat them over at our newest server s section newest like i wa around the week before for her training i got a mild scolding over how i turned the table it wa apparently a fire hazard i had done it before and nobody had said anything but sure easy fix fire safety thing tend to be a bit odd so other then a bit confused i went with it made some small talk apparently a slightly fatal error i asked when her shift ended new server accidentally seat the next table in her section again not a big deal i just told her i d take the table since her other wa already a larger group well manager wa not pleased she yelled at anybody who mixed section ever we have two table section and one booth section which mean whoever get the booth almost always get swamped while the two table section might get table between them so none of the server mind dipping into each other s section or picking up table if it get too busy i told her i wa worried about new server having both a larger table and that one a well and manager told me she would help her out spoiler she never did phone still ringing like mad other server come in everybody end up with a couple table and new server did just fine manager decides she need to have me do everything under the sun and keep directing me at thing that are anything but dealing with my table i even end up working drive through for a bit which wa certainly not my job for the night unfortunately because of that i forgot to put an order in my bad but luckily the couple wa understanding eventually most people disperse to who know where after the call volume come down manager two come yelling from the back saying anyone who doesn t start taking phone call is going to get written up she can only hear the ringing phone in the back not see that every single available phone up front wa being used most the hour phone go off again i m working on getting stuff out to a table and leave it for another coworker to get who wasn t doing anything manager two yell at me for not taking call and that call come first and my table can wait i just kind of ignore it and carry on later on i m out finally working on clearing off one of my table that left at least one other person wa behind the counter when i left and i had my back turned to it i wa also a fair distance away from it manager two come out and yell at me to get the phone i answer back that i m in the back aka it would take me a moment and if possible could she or another person take the call looking back i could have said something else but i also highly doubt she would have treated it any differently she leaf i end up there a few moment later and take the call not a clue where my coworkers had vanished to only a couple ours into my shift i get pulled aside by manger one and reamed about my attitude i m being written up when i go into shift today for snapping at different manager including one that i had said maybe sentence to let alone snapped at told me all about how i need to work on my attitude how i only make the manager s job harder that i need to learn how to multitask and deal with how busy friday night were that a lot of people apply there and how lucky i wa to have my job i wa in near tear and while she very very slowly transferred my table so i could clock out she had me take customer phone call i think i managed to sound marginally okay although i did have to dart off into the bathroom to cry a bit for a moment i d like to quit and after i leave for the summer i know i m certainly not coming back in the fall like i had planned to there where a few thing i could have done better but i most certainly didn t deserve that

if you are a server we all know that dreaded person chewing gum putting it in a sugar packet or their napkin and leaving it there for u to pick up and how awesomely disgusting picking up someone s gum is like breaking out the glove to bus the table disgusting well today i saw karen in the wild with her stacked up bleached hair jumping gum like a cow while she placed her order and i came back and saw that she had put her gum in the little corner of her paper napkin by the way we have cloth napkin for the guest to use and paper napkin for their drink so anyway she put her gum in part of the paper napkin and put it to the side close to the wall in a small booth i probably would ve knocked over all of the drink trying to get to the gross napkin ball of gum all of my coworkers and i laugh about how i have to pick up gum eww gross whatever but oh my god this is karen wa different she took her gross ball of gum with her and disposed of it properly i wa so caught off guard sorry typing this on a double i have to go back to work i am just dumbfounded at the crazy shift of the universe that is karen maybe they are becoming self aware good luck and i hope you don t have to pick up anything grows tonight make lot of money and have fun
i just arrived to my shift and there s a few guest from a wedding party who checked in tonight drinking in the lobby two lady just approached me and said we have something to tell you i m like uh oh the one lady told me someone did something disgusting in the woman s bathroom and she had to go to her room to use the bathroom i apologized and tightened my boot strap for the dirty job ahead some lesser agent may just put an out of order sign on the door but no not i first i went to the housekeeping room and got a cart with a mop on it i braced myself to survey the damage did someone shit on the floor vomit in the sink i ve witnessed some terrible thing upon entering the woman s bathroom the distinctive stench of fecal matter filled my nostril this wa unquestionably doo doo i would be dealing with a sense of bittersweet relief washed over me a i entered the first stall and witnessed the damage within wa contained entirely within the toilet bowl there wa no outside spillage however the monstrous terror contained within the bowl made me shudder in disgust with a hand over my nose i leaned over to inspect the stinky content humongous log floated at the surface resting atop dark brown water and soaked toilet paper the log were mighty and robust five or six solid loaf approximately five inch long and two inch thick at least not to mention whatever mess wa lying beneath the tp later before long i could stand the stench no longer gagging i rushed out of the bathroom and took deep breath of the untainted air outside a my mind cleared i gathered myself and determined a course of action the tool i had at my disposal on the housekeeping cart would not be enough i had to improvise a i wa preparing to face the half dozen beast a guest came up and asked me to switch room to a double bed a i went about switching his room i could barely focus a my mind strayed to the hideous bowl of feces lying in wait mere foot away i felt a though the loaf were taunting my subconscious i wa determined to send them to their demise in order to flush the mess it would be necessary to break the mighty loaf so they could fit down the drain to their watery graf after quickly perusing the back office i realized i could not disrespect any of these object with such a humiliating and disgusting use the object used would have to be immediately disposed of after completion of the job like in the irishman when robert deniro is throwing away his gun after a hit like so many time i wa faced with this scenario with my own turd i realized i needed a stick there are a few tree outside however our landscaping make sure fallen stick don t last long after looking i discovered none were on the ground so i had no choice but to rip one off i apologized to the tree and thanked it for it service to the hotel then i jumped up and grabbed hold of a branch with all my weight i held onto the branch and it snapped almost off i grabbed it again and twisted until the bark broke i had my tool with confidence i walked back into the hotel and grabbed a paper towel to hold over my nose the time had come to face this challenge head on i took a deep breath and entered the bathroom without delay i stabbed the first loaf and wa relieved to see it broke apart immediately very little squishing going on a clean break the difficulty increased a i moved to the turd closer to the center of the bowl a i needed to move them closer to the side in order to press down and break them during this time i had the unfortunate thought process of analyzing the content of these piece of shit i wa stabbing one of the turd looked grayish and for a moment i thought maybe someone had gone to denny s and accidentally dropped their sausage in but no i stopped myself these were definitely turd i realized these log were like the ring in lord of the ring sinisterly transfixing like frodo i needed to cast them into the fire of mordor or in this case flush them down the toilet feeling a though it wa time i pressed down the handle for the moment of date but damn nothing happened i needed to press the handle down and hold it for a moment but i wa overwhelmed by the rejuvinated stench from the now deformed turd and had to flee for air when i exited for air still holding my stick with fecal matter at the end i encountered the family i had moved before taking their belonging to their new room they momentarily looked at me and the kid wa staring stay in school kid i said then breathed deep a the final battle wa about to commence this time i wa through playing game i marched into the stall and stepped on the handle holding it down until every single remnant of the pile of shit had been eliminated from our pristine establishment there were streak of shit left behind on the bottom and side of the bowl this had been a bowel movement of monumental proportion but cleaning that is a task for another day my job wa done i wrapped the stick in it own garbage bag and tied it up throwing it in the dumpster i had a moment of contemplation and silence for the stick who saved the day the guest went to sleep without anyone else entering the stall i will not be receiving any accolade for this heroic deed just the sense of personal satisfaction that our lady restroom is now safe for use without the danger of being confronted with a soul crushing sight and vomit inducing stench thanks for reading only more hour and i get to go home
today i had a woman come up and knock on the door to the kitchen menu in hand and when i open the door she start naming out what she wanted to order i wasn t sure if she wa serious at first but after the second or third dish i realized she wasn t joking i thought maybe she s been waiting long and foh is slacking but no there were only a few table and plenty of staff i don t know
on one quiet evening while at the front desk i saw a static black object on our security camera monitor in the loading area for some reason i went immediately outside to check and here it wa a black briefcase it wa very heavy for it s size lot of paper and a macbook can be seen from the edge i took it right in the office and put a note to review the camera later if no one claim it couple of hour later i admittedly forgot at that point a middle aged man come in the lobby an interior hotel and just sits by the window not a single word just zoning out after a little while a he s passing me by leaving he utters i messed up i messed up big time i asked him why he said he wa suppose to deliver his bos s briefcase and in it are important original copy paper payroll and the bos laptop along with about k in cash he wa one of the company s driver i must ve dropped it when i wa unloading and someone took it we will never find out there s just so many people in and out of here i have to make the call but i don t know what to say i told him to hold on for a sec and came back holding the briefcase the man s face wa speechless overfilled with joy smiling to almost tear thanking me over and over he even reached out to try and hug me from behind the desk a i wa concluding my shift ready to leave the man came in reached out and put in my hand he told me to buy myself something nice he wa still in tear i don t know what consequence he would ve had to face if it wa indeed lost but i still remember his sincerity in thanking me till today
this is an admittedly stupid stupid story but it s something i have to deal with far too often i work for a well known grocery store that us a bell system it s known for employing very nice people who

usually they drop the same joke i ve heard a million time there s a famous person who also go by these initial and move on in the conversation it s all very succinct and almost always pleasant but sometimes i ll get customer who demand i tell them my real name and will not back down this is a story about one of those time a couple of day ago this guy come to my register to pay i don t think he wa meaning to come off a an asshole but wa just not aware of how he wa sounding he immediately zero in on my name tag and jump right in i can t even get a greeting out of my mouth before he start i m

the name on my tag are initial for my name i have gone by my initial for a number of year proceed to tell him who started calling me by my initial and why it stuck but do not tell him what the letter

middle of greeting d barely get out how are when d look closely at my bos s name tag and interrupt him to flatly say pronounce your name my bos wa a little taken aback i think but say his name it s an uncommon ethnic name my bos is a person of color d then say to my bos what s your middle name bos looking a bit confused tell d his middle name it s just awkward now d try to pronounce the name a couple of time name that honestly are not at all hard to pronounce laugh and give up d with that stupid grin on his face then turn to me and go see it s not that hard he s got a first name and a middle name for day he should be the one with a nickname meanwhile you re stonewalling well anyway have a good one say my name super sarcastically i wish i knew what my face looked like in that moment my bos walk him out and come back about minute later which i found weird because it shouldn t have taken him more than three minute to get back he immediately come over to me and begin to apologize for d s behavior and said a few thing that made me think my manager had some word with the guy but my manager end it with name are special to u they hold significance and i m sorry that dude didn t understand that i guess this is what it come down to it s ok to ask question about stuff in fact i welcome all question let s have a conversation but like read the damn room if you ask someone a question seven time in a row and they are giving you an answer they deem sufficient move on you don t have to like my name but you do have to respect it i get it s unusual to you but you don t know me and you re not entitled to know anything about me only info i m willing to volunteer anyway that s my story

so i work at a hotel with room well the manager s family ha claimed room in addition to the manager s apartment for storage and their small kid fair enough we ve also got a housekeeper and her son who fell on hard time and my manager gave them room they ve been here about a year so that s room now we have room that ha a leak in the ceiling and my manager ha pretty much just written it off because the owner doesn t want to pay for roof repair and other room that are down for various repair related reason like lock and ac unit not working properly that s room now the third floor ha a few room that are smoking room this is where the local usually hang out wrecking those room and scaring everyone else only room are smoking but the other are pretty much a loss because the smell up there cause anyone who s not a smoker to complain and ask to be moved room left so for a long time my manager s wife ha gotten majorly upset if we put anyone in the room above their three room from the way the room are situated this is about room where she ll start calling and threatening to kick them out at around pm if they don t stop walking around so her kid can sleep she is sensitive to the least little noise room now so the housekeeper ha snuck her cat in he s old and blind and for some reason like to meow loudly at night we re not a pet friendly hotel so all u front deskers know to not put people in the room on either side of the housekeeper s room unless we really have to more room left and last but not least the manager ha now said that since his kid get night terror and scream loudly in the middle of the night and they ve gotten complaint about it i shouldn t put anyone else on the first floor until further notice that s another room gone lucky it s the slow time of year since i only have freaking room on the right side of the second floor hall with nothing wrong with them that no one will get mad at me for booking lol
i know we are all indoctrinated and pressed into fear and submission of corporate but i had it up to here with them and their greed and this oversell feature we have had some guest tonight who had to be walked to another hotel and they were understandably furious every hotel in a mile radius is sold out and it is unacceptable that their reservation is not honored especially if they made it well in advance the guest were naturally inquisitive a to why this is the case i tried my best to use the corporate lingo and runaround fluff speech but i had enough with the deception toward these tired lied to and deceived guest i pretty much told them corporate oversells the hotel to avoid lost revenue from no show and that shiny stone member get preference a well a those with or more night i told them it is horrible policy and deceitful and need to end and i would be just a mad a them my last guest wa a shiny stone and i could not give up that room i told them this a well because i had to it s part of the policy and they asked me straight up of course i offered them every recompense in the book and i wa thankfully able to find a room elsewhere and they were nice about it and understanding of the predicament corporate place me in a a night auditor i don t understand why i m placed in these managerial situation and decision but not getting manager pay i made the decision to tell them the full and unequivocal truth and i stick by it am i in the wrong for spilling the bean and should i be fearful of corporate getting mad at me for telling the truth i tell them to shove it they make million dollar a month which i m sure equal to million a month in profit and this nickel and diming is sick and prey on the little people the guest who are lied to and u having to cover said lie and walk the guest
this weekend will be the last day my hotel is open for business yesterday our gm got a call from the overlord at cornholio saying to close the place down we got day notice the whole staff the guest everything is to be vacated and moved out by tomorrow at noon no severance no compensation no nothing this wa favorite job the best one i ve had so far in my life and i m pretty darn pissed about it so my dear friend for now i descend from your rank until i can find another job it ha been real your friendly neighborhood na
i work full time a a server at a smaller restaurant there is only ever one server on at a time we stay pretty busy i wa talking to my coworker yesterday who is in the middle of a custody battle she ha to see this court appointed person to help decide how their parenting plan will work she told me while she wa at an appointment with him yesterday he told her that he is one of my regular he asked her if i wa married or if i had a boyfriend and if she thought he should ask me out i have no idea who this is i have a lot of regular her description of him did not help she think maybe i should because it might help her out but i m kind of creeped out by it just wondering if maybe i m wrong to be and looking for an objective opinion
i ve almost always worked at corporate restaurant but this is the first one i ve worked at where we sell a loyalty program membership they only just last month added an incentive for server to sell it an extra in your check once a month but nobody at our store sell more than the a month this one guy doe anyways and he basically only focus on selling membership he rarely doe side work or run food drink he s more of a salesman than a server i can upsell food and drink just fine but i feel uncomfortable pushing a reward program that people have to pay for especially when i can tell my table don t care and are only politely listening waiting for me to shut up about it i just want to give people a good experience and get a good tip haha well anyways during a meeting at the beginning of the month our manager said we ve been slacking and she used to threaten our schedule before but now she got a promotion and she really ha control of them so if we don t sell at least membership for the month our schedule will be cut and we ll have to take mandatory class for selling these membership is that something she can do i d like to say i m a good server amp i don t feel like this should affect my schedule
idea for the best comeback line for a million dollar

i worked a a server some year back and got to experience the wonder of humankind at the feeding trough something i learned from my year of experience is that woman seem to not much care for a female server waiting on them when they are with their husband maybe because that is usually their role they are just more critical of another female i don t know that is what i had observed maybe it wa just me but some of their response to my presence reinforced this for me at one of the restaurant i worked i had a regular guy come in one day with his wife this wa the first time i had ever seen the wife and it appeared she wa excited about it she looked around a lot and read every page of our two page menu with avid interest i took their drink order her an iced tea him a coffee i returned with their drink on a tray a that is how that restaurant liked their food and beverage brought out i also arranged my drink on the tray a to where they would go once at the table with three step still to reach their table the wife see me she reach out and say oh here i got it she commences to grab her iced tea from my tray a the husband put up his hand not quick enough to stop her crash removing her tea my tray wa imbalanced and splash hot coffee splashed all over the husband lol she tried to make it my fault but he stopped her cold or hot i should say lol i never saw him bring her in again

so long time lerker first time posting i m on mobile i wa working a shift a a togo specialist server i am in charge of checking the server out at close this mean i cannot leave until after all the server are gone this night i wa standing up front waiting for the manager to lock the door we close at pm it wa and second this i can see at my computer at the front i wa counting the second it wa a long day but i picked up a double and wa force to close that very moment a guest walk up a the manager wa approaching the door the manager let them in he said yes we are open furious i watched at the rude people walked in a literal second before we close no exaggeration the kitchen wa basically closed now their food will take a bit longer they order a bottle of wine and expect to be there late my night ended at around pm i wa forced to sit there and wait for the guest to leave on the bright side for the server i let them leave so that we were not both tortured with this i took the table they ended up tipping me on a bill my service wa great but i cant hide my irritation due to their rudeness my frustration is who in their right mind come into a restaursunt within the minute it close and belief it is alright
one night we sold out i wa very sick but overnight and first shift called out so i m working a sold out shift barely able to stand coughing up a storm i later learned i had pneumonia anyway this guy walk in and asks if we have any room i tell him we do not he pull out his phone online it say you do well that is not accurate we do not have any room well it look like ota will let me book a room what if i do that please do not sir we do not have any more room and the only thing you will get is a refund in three to five business day online it say you have room why can t you give me a room we are sold out i m sorry the online inventory is not accurate but we cannot honor any new reservation if you didmake one i would be forced to cancel it and refund you thankfully this did it and the guest left i just have to wonder why he thought that booking through a third party online would magic up an extra clean room for what it s worth that particular ota ha our room inventory incorrect and think we have about additional room based on report from my agm
this guy wa a nightmare the whole time he wa here i could get in to a hundred other thing he tried to pull but i m just going to cover his attempt to get a free room twice in a row on the day he s supposed to be checking out he just never left the room we were really slow for the holiday so housekeeping never checked to make sure he actually left because they were going to roll it anyway and had spoken to him directly about his late check which is admittedly our fault i also didn t find out until later that he had spoken to housekeeping that day because i didnt know this he still had plausible deniability when we spoke later on i knew his face and room number because i d gotten in to numerous encounter with him already about different thing none of which are relevant anyway around pm on his checkout day i see him dash through the lobby looking sketchy a hell i look him up and see his reservation had been checked out so i go up to the room and sure enough he had left the chain open on the door so he d be able to get back in i didn t know where he went or how long he d be gone so i closed the door and locked him out like minute later he come to the desk fuming he immediately started blaming u trying to frame it to be our fault first thing he said before i even had the chance to address him when he came to the desk wa i m supposed to be checking out tomorrow and my key isnt working that alone wa odd that he immediately got defensive about how he wa checking out tomorrow not today then he admits his key wasn t working earlier which is also weird to admit because if he thought he really had another night he would have asked to have his key remade and if his key wasn t working earlier how d he get back in i called him out on that to which he just stuttered because he didn t have an answer there wa still a possibility that it wa a genuine confusion on his part although given his action and the way he wa acting unlikely so i didn t come out and say i knew he wa trying to take advantage of a slow night we went back and forth about how i wouldn t match his rd party rate from the past night of course he wa rd party he finally agreed to make a new reservation on the rd party because i wouldn t let him back in the room without payment he go upstairs and i email my coworkers to watch out for his shit the next day housekeeping tell me they actually did go up to the room that day and he said he wa going to be leaving at pm so that prof beyond a shadow of doubt that he knew he wa supposed to check and wa trying to see if he could pull one over on u and then he ha the audacity to try to make me and my coworker feel like it wa our fault he got locked out and of course later that next day he try the same exact thing he told housekeeping he wa leaving at which wa communicated to the front desk this time but when i came in at he wa still in the room i called him and before i could even say anything he said i m staying another night i ll make it right now so he wa trying the same shit he knew he wa staying over but didn t make a reservation because he wanted to see if he could slip through the crack what a jackass
so starting last night for day there s a big group staying at our property this is the st year for me dealing with this group at this property had major group every year at st property i worked at seems to me everyone around here ha lost their mind they ve decided that after breakfast everything get picked up amp put behind the desk if guest want plate bowl or utensil they have to pay per item they re also zip tying all the cabinet in the breakfast area they also asked my to divide these item into set each i am not doing that that s just not smart to put that much or little really in the breakfast area at one time and only one breakfast attendant with a full house amp order came in personal opinion i just don t see this being a good idea i feel embarrassed having to tell a guest that i have to charge them especially when it s not a normal thing around here just feel wrong update so after talking to a few coworkers this morning apparently they only do this for this group every single year seems this group just help themselves to what s available but i still feel there s a better solution to this other than zip tie amp charging people i know if someone told me i had to pay for a fork i d laugh at them
i work in a hotel restaurant in new orleans i usually come in to no side work being done and have to do it all before i even start my shift we have to wash our own dish polish all silverware and glass make sure a tray run is done every few hour stock the entire restaurant etc i ve been doing morning shift side work plus my own for month now complaining to management often but nothing ever get done about it today wa no different other than i wa completely alone for hour with everything to do and expected to be in the front at all time while also making sure all the side work is done it s impossible but whatever every single table i had in the hour if being alone tipped le than and one table tipping on a check im so frustrated at this point that i m ready to walk out guest are coming into the kitchen after only waiting le than minute for their food and raising hell at me and the cook it s a shit show my coworker finally get here and thing dont change people still are stiffing u and one table even charged the order to the room but didnt leave a room number or a legible name even though we always ask them to print and sign their name to the ticket and the room number towards the end of the night a young couple walk in i roll my eye bc i m over it sit them converse with them like usual they re the nicest table ive had all day once they finish eating i bring their ticket run their card etc it wa an ticket and the way people had been tipping all day i really wasn t expecting a big tip at all they leave i bus their table and open the book and there lie a bill i see them a few minute later and run up to them to thank them tl dr after a series of shitty customer i get a really sweet couple who tipped more than
i ve worked a a server at a large casino in the midwest for a number of year now it is on sovereign land or whatever so i know there s not a lot of federal right or so they say when i first started they trained server in one specific venue and that s it you were not allowed to work in another restaurant inside the casino unless you were fully transferring fast forward to last year we are now all required to work at least shift in another venue very often being scheduled outside of our availability on top of that there are banquet that used to be optional they would set up a time sheet and allow people to fill in if they wanted extra shift eventually the banquet section at the casino got incredibly busy there are banquet room with one main room used mainly for concert but can be broken down into more banquet hall the banquet staff wa not adequately staffed so they started adding server in restaurant to the banquet schedule the main reason this is an issue for me and many others is that they always schedule outside of availability my restaurant is open from pm to pm yet they schedule me for a am banquet fuck you and on top of that there is no set wage we have absolutely no idea what we re going to be getting paid until we get our check stub on pay day some time it s great work hour and get an extra on your check but very very often this is not the case most recently i worked a party for guest of the casino who had won a certain amount of money in the last month i worked hour and received a service charge on my check is there anything i can do this is obviously unacceptable their logic is that we should get tipped but nobody that worked that banquet made a single dollar in tip sorry for the wall of text just found this sub and am incredibly frustrated at work
i work relief night audit in a small town outside a major national park honestly it s a pretty good gig i get to live in one of our room for practically free and i m paid more than enough to get by but i swear this hotel is cursed first two day before i got here a regular committed suicide in a room putting it out of order for almost a month while we had to replace all of the furniture and then once we get that fixed up we have the glory of one of the most disgusting people i ve ever met staying in the same room he wa a walk in at the beginning of one of my day shift seemed pleasant enough but there wa a distinct odor to him but we assumed he had just stopped working at one of the ranch nearby and everything would be fine we get him settled into his room and everything seemed fine soon enough it s time to replace the coffee at the desk and a i m walking by his room to do so i catch a whiff of the same smell a earlier but it s not the smell of animal shit clinging to the guy like i had assumed it s fresh shit i now assume that he probably just ate something bad i also notice that instead of his door being closed he ha used the privacy latch to keep the door ajar the next day i come in and the housekeeper is just finishing for the day she make a comment about one of the room being gross but we take her to mean normal grossness from a le than tidy guest and accept her room list without looking at it too hard around this time i also notice that the walk in from last night ha extended his stay while eating my dinner in the back that same room list catch my eye like when you re bored somewhere so you just read all the label on bottle and i read the comment on the room the random had to replace shower curtain here keurig malfunctioning there and then i get to the room of last night s walk in dear god that room the housekeeper had to remove dispose of and replace everything in the room not because the guest had requested it but because everything wa covered in blood piss and shit especially shit instead of telling u when she went to clean the room and found it covered in shit she cleaned it alone and instead of telling u when she brought her room list she just said a room wa pretty gross and he had extended his stay oh god of course he decided the next day that he wanted to extend another day but for some reason the girl at the desk decided instead of tacking on another day to the existing reservation she would make a new one but this time his card didn t go through so she told him he couldn t stay another night i come in for my night shift and read over the housekeeping comment and again she had to replace everything because it wa covered in shit but then my coworker tell me that the room hadn t been checked out of the system because the card declined after dealing with this man for the last two day his card wouldn t even go through for the second night of his stay let alone the over worth of damage he caused with his asshole i had to adjust off the second night and damage so i could run the audit of course the phone number he left to contact him doesn t work and a week and a half later the card still hasn t gone through tl dr walk in guest cause worth of damage to a room we just had to redo by shitting all over his room we could only get one night of payment and none of his contact information seems to be true
aren t run in s with friend awesome lol this just happened about minute ago i m at the desk about to start my audit paperwork when two people walk in the first person i ve never laid eye on before in my life the second person i wa a groomsman in his wedding six year ago haven t seen him much since then his eye go wide when he see s me behind the desk then begin to dart between me and the person with him who by the way is not his wife and is not even a woman they have a reservation for a room with a single king bed and a he hand me the payment i notice the lighter area of his finger where his wedding band should be seriously wtf dude i smile and nod pretend he s a stranger give them their key and send them on their way oh the thing you see a a night auditor but then remember silence is golden incidentally this guy wa a good friend in high school and the first person i ever came out to and he always came off straight a could be so i m definitely noticing a pattern of dishonesty here lmao
i wa in two mind whether to write this post or not but i can t sleep because of this experience i had with guest today in the restaurant and i need to get it off my chest i am trying to be a vague a possible when speaking about the guest but this is my first time posting so if i m breaking a rule please tell me so i can take this down i got seated a large family this afternoon some others server warned me to keep an eye on them for putting plastic in their food or just finding way to get out of paying the bill etc this wa purely based on stereotyping on the other server part and not because they recognised them a regular however i believe in treating everyone the same so i made a real effort with them and i really enjoyed serving their table spending a lot of time with them making the kid balloon animal etc they were super nice and chatty the kid were gorgeous especially their little blue eyed baby and polite the parent made them all behave themselves the kid were asking the parent if it wa ok if they had certain thing off the menu and they were just generally really enjoyable guest to serve they finish their meal and i m at a waiter station doing something or other and the dad pop his head round and said he s just nipping to the loo and i said i ll grab him the bill i go to the table to drop the bill and they re all gone i said to my manager that the dad wa in the toilet and to go check if he wa still there dad come out of the toilet and i said the bill s on the table and he wa like oh yes thanks love then a manager came to me and said t is waiting to pay his bill dad then start walking towards the door host stand saying i just pay it down here right and i wa like well i can get you a pdq and do it at this point we are at the door and the pdq at the host stand decides it s not going to work he say would cash be better for you love and i said whatever is best for him but i can get a working machine if he wait a sec he say i ve got cash in the van i ll just go and get it and that s when i knew that it wa game over he went outside to the van where the whole family wa loaded in got in and drove off a in the title the bill they left behind wa walk out happen i know that but in year of working in hospitality i ve never felt this hurt by one i spent so much time with them and they played me like a fiddle my manager were fine about it on my end and said i couldn t have done anything more than i did even if i got the pdq working he would have said his card wasn t working he didn t have it and needed to get his cash out of the van so it wa a no win situation i just feel like a complete mug for falling for it and both angry and humiliated it completely ruined my day tbh anyone else had walk out that affected them like this i know i m lucky that i didn t have to cover the cost of their bill a other place make their server do
serious question if that s allowed i ve been serving for about year and more recently have had a job at a higher end restaurant in my downtown area where there are quite a few homeless people living a guy walked in yesterday and wa sat by my manager he had a huge backpack and to me without negative judgment he appeared homeless he wa courteous to me the whole time i never treat anybody differently when serving them because i ve found that people surprise you going both way based on their look anyways he order he eats he walk out my manager followed him outside but he wa gone i m not sure what they would have done if they had found him i feel bad and think he probably doesn t enjoy walking in to a place and not paying but he also need to eat there are shelter and place all around downtown where they have food for free if he had even asked for food or said he couldn t pay we have ton of employee meal i would have given to him i don t want to insult anyone by asking can you pay for this at the beginning but if they can t then maybe we can move forward and they can still get a meal without stealing from a business what would everyone else do in this situation i don t have to pay for any walk out at this job so no loss to me other than my time i suppose the answer is going to be it s not my job but my manager to decide on these thing but i don t know it left a weird feeling for me
warning long this is my first time ever posting a story so please go easy on me also if this doesn t belong here please let me know and i ll remove it so i worked in hospitality for year i m currently a sahm and i ve seen a lot of crazy thing but this by far wa the craziest background so i wa working at night a a front desk supervisor but i wa filling in day shift on the weekend while another supervisor wa on vacation the hotel wa old and had a bad reputation for break in drug and a rape the year prior another supervisor and i had started turning the place around since the day we started we were only there about month but i wa working audit until recently when i wa told i wa being promoted and my schedule wa changed without me accepting i wa an operation manager for year and with a baby only a few month old i didn t want that responsibility the story so i started my shift at am that morning and almost an hour in i get a call from an outside number it s a woman who state she s a guest and a she left moment earlier she saw blood drop on the walkway by her room and figured someone had cut their hand but then she entered the elevator and there wa so much blood she took the stair there s more than one elevator but the hotel is a bit confusing it took me a bit to learn the layout i apologized and assured her that i would have it cleaned and do an investigation into it she said okay thank you and disconnected my general manager is very cheap so i m honestly grateful she doesn t bring up compensation the call ended and the front desk agent walked in to start her shift at am i explained what the guest had said and dispatched maintenance to investigate the checkout storm rolled in quickly and i remember it being extremely hellish i get a call from a room while being handed a never ending flow of keycard from tour group guest who just turn them in and leave i call the gm s assistant he s not in yet and catch him up to speed i send picture and tell him i want to call the cop he say no i answer a call from a room phone it s a man who complains that he received no sleep last night due to a couple having a verbal physical fight above him and the man threatening to kill the woman sadly this isn t surprising i asked if he had called the front desk the night before to report it and he say no i offer him a late check out even though at this time i thought i d be chastised for it he say thank you and hang up i look up the guest staying in the room above the man who just called in and it s one of room under this name each guest is also listed in the reservation i try to call the room with the noise complaint and that guest did not answer i went to knock on the door i would let them know about the noise complaint but really be doing a wellness check the guest did not answer i called the housekeeping supervisor and asked that she inform me of any issue in this room when being cleaned and to make sure they go with the housekeeper i bit later checkout storm still going i get a call from the housekeeping supervisor there s blood in a room and it s not the room from the noise complaint but it is registered under the same name at this point i m really starting to worry i leave the agent alone at the desk to investigate myself guy there wa blood everywhere all the bedding the couch the carpet the tile the mirror and wall the hall wall had a sliding bloody handprint straight out of a horror film i ask housekeeping and they ve never had bbp training not surprised i tell them not to touch anything i would be back to strip the room and clean i went to the room that had the noise complaint with one of the maintenance guy security had left at am something i managed to get changed but wouldn t go into effect until monday i knocked announced and entered the room wa completely fine it looked like a normal check out wtf is going on the gm s assistant finally come in and i update him on the latest and inform him that i called pd the rd room registered under this name had a late check out the gma call the room phone and the guest doesn t answer he call the cell number listed and explains the noise complaint and the blood he try to get an explanation out of him but he claim his son and son friend were in those room he let him know that i charged him a cleaning fee and he try to protest saying we should charge his son he let him know that he signed the incidental notice he put his card down and when it come to u he s responsible i could hear the gma s end and he tell me the rest after they hang up the cop show up and i greet them i call the gma and he take over explaining and lead them to the room i didn t clean the bloody room a pd wanted to leave it a is but i did go clean another room with blood unrelated looked like a nose bleed i remembered the guest it wa just a sweet young guy after this i take the linen to the laundry to see where they dispose of bbp the laundry attendant tell me with so much disgust that they don t throw them away i can t believe it that mean that they are contaminating the washer dryer and other linen no hotel i have ever worked at i used to go to different property with my last management company ha ever kept bloody linen i message the gm via group chat his preferred method of communication to confirm this a i really could not believe it i have screenshots of him speaking down to me and telling me just to make sure i got the money for it this wa on sunday i left my shift not knowing if someone wa killed and disgusted by management for the way they went about thing my next shift wa tuesday the day i resigned i mention this incident along with plenty of other thing i m sorry if this doesn t make sense edit sentence missing from transferring story from my phone s note

conducting a search in this sub reddit with the keywords refund and comp made me realized that there would be a post nearly once a day complaining about entitled customer demanding refund that got me thinking how often do customer demand refund what s the average occurrence in a single day that you see at work and how can there be so many insensitive jerk breathing the same air a you and i they stayed sat drank and ate our food now they demand a full refund to their partially or even half eaten meal it seems very unfair to me amp x b amp x b if they go to the nearest convenience store to buy a gallon of water do they complain about the fact that it s not exactly gallon if they go to the nearest supermarket to buy pre packaged food do they complain about the portion being too much
i worked a the night auditor for year at a star hotel just recently the fdm quit and i wa offered the position with a raise so i took it kind of reluctantly because i am well aware that if someone doesn t come in for their shift i have to work theirs and mine which is there are fda that are remnant from the last manager that quit by no show no call a soon a i took the position all hell broke loose i had to fire the weekend auditor which left me to work night shift a week i hired some young girl for the weekend audit but she no showed no called after one week so here we go again the general manager put this girl from housekeeping a my assistant she doesn t assist me in anything she call off at least shift a month and is late at least of her shift when i try to take some type of action upper management shoot me down i m feeling what is the point of me being the manager when i m being micro managed by them i can t really make any real decision to improve the fd when the other manager wa here she hired all her little friend and they ran amuck now i m trying to save the sinking ship but i see i m fighting a losing battle this place is run like junior high school instead of an establishment one good thing though at least it s not our peak time it s slow and i have a lot of down time to blog catch up on my show etc i am year old and will retire in a few year thank god but it baffle me how some of these young people have no work ethic they are consistently late minute sometimes more consistently calling off or not even showing up upper management is forever making excuse for them thank god i hired this one girl who is awesome she is always early willing to work extra shift even the night audit she is really worth her weight in gold don t know what i would do if it weren t for her saving me at this point i don t even know if i even want to be here for the summer when we get super busy i m too old to work hour shift back to back plus the night audit think i ll go back to cv or bank of america
i ve only been working at this hotel since june but i ve been working in hotel for the past year so i picked up pretty quickly i mainly do morning shift with a man that s been there since the hotel opened so year and he is the worst human being i ve ever met in my life he s rude to everyone including guest gossip about everyone in every department and never ha a nice thing to say about anyone this man is year old and apparently working here is just his passtime he s said on multiple occasion i don t need this job i m only here because i wa too bored when i retired for month so he stick around to make everyone miserable he s also racist sexist homophobic and probably anything else you could think of and he voice his opinion about everything very loudly and doesn t care if anyone hears him i ve gone home cry a few time because of how he s treated me my favorite is when he said you fucked everything up over something very minor that wasn t even a mistake i ve gone to the fom multiple time about his behavior and most recently because he shoved me pretty violently and all she ever say is we ll talk to him i know it s not her fault she s an amazing manager and one of the only reason why i haven t quit yet but it s the gm that s scared of him i don t know if he ha something on her but his action never seem to have any consequence and i m sick of it i love my job but i m under so much stress working with him everyday and i don t know what to do anymore sorry for the rant but i just needed to share this
so our pool ha been out of order for about a month now while maintenance is waiting on a part for the water pump and oh the review have been glorious caller number bitched about how it wa an affront to the lord to falsely advertise that our pool wa still open no management hasn t updated the website even though i ve mentioned it before another one said in all cap that she deserved a discount for not being able to swim because she wa a lifetime super special top tier snowflake spoiler alert her attitude nixed that for her and finally another one said that this hotel isn t very accommodating yep you guessed it carbon diamond snowflake these review are starting to get to me like i get that the hotel doesn t have a working pool at the moment but everything else wa fine that s the only complaint it s been an interesting month
tonight we had visibly started to close the restaurant all our outside table and chair had been stacked and the big door of our restaurant closed the small door still open minute before we close customer walk in and ask of they can still order a our website said we were still open for minute i told them with the approval of my manager they can order but it take away only a we would be closed by the time their food is finished the customer then had a brilliant idea and asked if they can just get take away then eat it in the restaurant a they wanted to eat out that night i honestly stared at her for a bit before realising she wa serious and had no clue that it would prevent u from being able to close
okay so my hotel just finished renovating a part of the renovation we took the soda machine and snack machine off the nd floor and added a gift shop i thought this wa a great idea instead of guest having to use cash on the snack machine and only card on the coke machine they can either use both or even charge it to the room so here s the problem my f amp b manager is in charge of all of the ordering for the gift shop he went all in on everything organic gluten free dairy free ect like i get it for a few thing it is always good to have variety for all guest but all of this stuff is so expensive we have a few snack like candy bar that are reasonably priced and a can of coke but those are only a few of our item we sell here is a list of our most expensive and ridiculously priced item sparkling water can dr brew kombucha seriously who would buy this plantain chip bag the size of a small bag of lay dk choc covered coconut moon cheese coconut water aloe drink who would pay for any of this shit sorry but no one is expecting to get a few snack and pay i think the main thing is every single day like half the guest that shop at our gift shop is like seriosuly for kombucha i can get the same brand at the store for or wheres the nearest mini mart it ha just been a bigger headache then it worth

i ll start off by saying i m not front desk for my small star hotel somewhere in the usa i m one of security folk that protect the property the staff and i guess to a lesser extent the guest but honestly they don t cross path with me a often a others just visiting for an event or out of town so this happened just before christmas on one of my back to back graveyard shift i pull just finished giving night audit a quick break and wa making my way back outside to my lot to post up for the next hour or so before i had to do a chore or two a i m walking down the hall i see a car drive through the lot from the window on the door to outside i speed up and walk out on the patio that s slightly elevated from the lot itself giving me a pretty good view of my entire domain this car ha decided to park in the darkest possible spot in the entire lot mind you we re not fully booked and there s plenty of well lit free spot that aren t notorious for being where shady shit go down because there s no lamp to illuminate the darkness by the bush line so my only weapon i have is a very large bright flashlight of justice that i won t hesitate to shine on anyone if they re doing something they shouldn t be that and a calm demeanor i can handle most thing i ve come across i d rather face down a rampaging homeless person than answer the phone at the desk but that s neither here nor there anyways i light up the car from a distance hoping this would motivate them to leave a they parked and didn t get out another red flag that somethings going on they re unmoved by the light flooding their car so i keep the light trained on the driver side window and slowly make my way to the car to make contact a i get closer the driver roll down the window and screech at me with her hand blocking her eye from the light first of all you can t just shine that light at people and i cut her off yes i can i m security for x hotel and subsequent property and we have closed for the night it wa around and the bar closed at so property closed to non guest at what the hell are you doing here admittedly my tone wasn t the best but this wasn t something new the previous night i had a pickup truck with three grown men in the front cab pull into the same trouble spot and just lighting them up got rid of them so my patience for shady shit wa about at zero she still blocking the light from her eye go i m waiting on a friend to check in and i cut her off again no you don t leave visible confusion a she attempt to repeat the lie to me no my friend hasn t checked in yet i m just waiting for them to get here i cut her off again no you don t there s no one checking in you need to leave now property is closed she start to sputter and protest and i remain resolute after hour it s just me and night audit and if we re being technical i m the highest ranking person on property at the time even if i m just a scurity grunt with no managerial authority so she try to pull a classic karen move on me you ll get in trouble for this uh huh doing my job you re being shady ok buddy what s your supervisor name calmly a i turned my back on her and walked back toward the patio i just say no i kill the patio light and position myself just past the bush that block the patio from being wide open to the parking lot and wait she creep by looking for me to i assume get that last word in but can t find me so she leaf her story didn t add up her behavior didn t match her story and ultimately she wa removed and never seen again sorry for the long post but i really wanted to share my story keep the faith fellow hospitality worker

so i worked a second job at a restaurant this past summer one made famous by tina fey to gain some extra cash and fill in day i normally would have been in school we all know that server can tend to have miserable job and miserable customer but it s the regular that can make or break you so i ve got this one karen with the haircut and all who call every morning to figure out the soup de jour now the hostess swears that she keep track of who had her last and rotates to give u a few encounter a possible but i m in day a week and i see her day a week nobody wanted her table but i d try and challenge myself to be extra nice to her and see if anything could be made of it i always greeted her by name a she entered the building had her coke no ice made and ready by the time the hostess had her seated and i knew her order by heart so every day i ask her how she s doing and she reply hi i m here on my lunch break so you ll have to make this quick i m ready to order now this could go one of two way she liked the soup though it wasn t the one she wanted she kept holding out for a fall special that came once every october and would get quite annoyed when we didn t supply it the rest of the year so she d get a soup salad combo aka the cheapest item on our lunch menu but there were the day she didn t like our soup she made a very big deal about ordering a meatball sub and that she wa having so much trouble finding something to order a we had no good soup that day let me remind you she called at opening every day to find out if we d have a soup she liked and she only ever ordered the same two meal now she also knew that it wa the same person serving her because i had a bright green ombr hairdo at the time she thought it would have looked better if it were purple but she continued to act affronted a if she had no idea how to manage not having a soup she liked every day she d leave a half glass of her coke no ice on which she d specifically ask for a half glass refill we charge for lunchtime refill but not if we re just topping off a drink to refresh it and a tip finally one day it happened we had a soup she especially liked and she wouldn t be able to make it in for lunch the next day she bought a to go container of it double the cost of her original meal and almost double the tip i swear we took an additional customer copy of the receipt and hung it in the kitchen for a month
so when i came to work i wa hearing those server name being mentioned a lot when i came in for my shift and already knew it wa code for them either getting fired or quitting so i found out of them were just pocketing a lot of money from guest when they paid in cash while the other one managed to steal some guest pass for a couple of day
seriously fuck you you re bringing your untrained dog into a hotel letting it piss and shit all over everything because you can t be bothered to go down the road and pay a dollar pet fee at a hotel that allows pet so you lie about your dog being a service animal and then leave the poor thing in your room while you go off fuck know where leaving it alone all day to bark and bother other guest actually fuck you not only doe housekeeping have to deal with your dog shit but i have to deal with irritated guest wondering why they were kept up all night by a dog in a no pet property which a lot of people stay at to avoid barking dog you are shit and you are hurting people who actually need to have service animal with your selfishness if you are bringing a dog with you on your trip you need to accommodate for that if you can t ask a friend to watch them put them in a dog hotel if you can afford it you were the person who took on the responsibility of a pet don t you dare act like a good pet owner when you do this shit no dog should be locked up like the dog on my property is for hour without anyone to check on it you should feel bad and if my manager weren t a bad a they were with dealing with pet in the room i would have already charged your as for this god this just piss me off so much take care of your fucking dog you actual trash pile
i don t like kid not ashamed of it i could never be a social worker that had to deal with kid like this poor lady am a woman and a teen about come down to the front desk lady is currently in biggest suite and need another room for tonight night the big issue it s not in her name card is not hers doesn t have the cc owner of card is not in house now i don t see on the re there is a cc auth but the room wa checked in earlier and i m betting there is a cc auth somewhere locked up in sale director s office no doubt or on gm e mail or something but either way that auth is only for one room so of course according to policy i need a nd cc auth for the new room the lady herself say she is texting the cc owner and the punk is on this lady s heel like a yappy dog asking dumb question after dumb question which is clearly pissing this woman off through the interaction between them while she is texting her bos seems the room ha a couple social worker and several kid and the reason they need a nd room is because punk in front of me got into some argument fight with some punk in the room and they have to separate them punk is asking shit like can t my brother my friend my sister just come get me what if i just left right now on my own can t you drop me off at the bus stop etc from what i can tell punk is under social worker s care by some legal mean so of course she s not going to do that and if punk weren t such a punk he not only would know that but probably wouldn t be in this situation so back and forth and i ve got the nd room ready to go just waiting for the card holder to e mail me a cc auth lo and behold a couple annoying minute later she get a text from bos saying they are not authorizing a nd room and apparently that mean lady is taking punk out of the hotel and driving to another town down the road which i m guessing is where they were all bound for tomorrow anyway so poor social worker let out a few expletive about how fucked up this is tell punk to come with her they re driving to x town cancel reservation gladly get a call right after from another room right next to big suite saying people were out in the hall talking loudly for a while can you come take care of it sure thing but by the time i got up there no one wa around and it wa quiet so they apparently resolved any discussion they had glad i stuck to policy glad i am not in social work i would not have the temperament lt nocturnal introverted misanthropic vampire i totally understand why parent smack their kid around totally
greeting fellow soldier on the front line of hospitality i work in a backpacker hostel which mean that i thankfully do not have to deal with the entitled gemstone wielding specie of guest but it doe mean that i occasionally have to deal with the crackpipe and lunacy wielding sub specie of alleged human the crackhead in this tale called in to book under the name crystal no joke generic english surname when guest call in to book we always make it very clear that they need to bring a form of identification with them a the law of our country state that we need to make a copy of said id at check in miss crystal duly arrives at the front desk without any form of id and a truly impressive array of crack teeth red flag number one you know how junky always give you their unsolicited life story before you can even get past a greeting well that happened and we learned that she had all her document stolen when her handbag wa lifted from her in a restaurant this is actually somewhat believable in our crime ridden city and that she hadn t applied for new one due to the fact she wa returning to her hometown of insert city name here in week my incredibly un helpful manager tell her that she can still check in a long a she go to the police station and get an affidavit with her id number and the detail of the theft she cheerfully agrees and her equally sketchy looking friend load her in her car and they drive off i made a point of informing my manager that miss crystal is a crackhead and she will without a doubt become a problem this cassandra like prediction will absolutely come to fruition miss crystal and friend reappear at the front desk some one and a half hour later brandishing a fresh affidavit which to my complete and utter lack of surprise ha her name a crystal insert obscure german surname her red flag number two i make a copy of the document and get her to fill in the registration form her friend pay for her another red flag we often have people come in and pay for their friend and leave u to mop up the mess this includes junky crazy people and hobo they do actually appear to be friend though and they proceed to sit at our small outdoor bar and request a couple of bottle of wine to drink while they enjoy a beautifully balmy african sunset another friend in the generic hipster flannel wearing scooter riding mould appears to join them about an hour and a half later i hear some very heated and uncouth language emanating from the bar area the bar is only a few metre from my desk i go outside and inquire what in the hell is going on i m greeted with a barrage of screeching from the trio which i can only liken to an agitated colony of rabid samango monkey at this point i look to my right and see another guest of ours in the staff dorm busy haranguing a fellow off duty staff member about something or other i head over to kick her out of our dorm it s not a strictly private space given that it s shared accommodation but it s our private space and that staff member isn t working leave him tf alone he s just trying to play the witcher ffs she screech and bolt off at this point i realised that the situation wasn t going to resolve itself fuck this devolved into the crack club and the aforementioned guest who i have very good reason to believe is also a junkie but at least she s quiet and paid up have a poo slinging match at the bar i break it up and follow the guest out to the front door when she storm off i do my best to gather information from her about the altercation and after several round of stop yelling and tell me what actually happened so i can deal with it i manage to ascertain that miss crystal wa threatening her grand i go to the bar kick the entire crack club out but not before taking the cost of their wine our of the negligible amount that our sparkly problem paid for her dorm bed and issuing change problem solved or not act not half an hour later a girl come in flanked by two somewhat iffy looking gentleman she ha a passport from a neighbouring country but they re paying for her would you look at that another red flag at this point i could make a quilt check in procedure done all by the book and i m pleased that i managed to re sell the bed in the dorm so yay it wa not yay about one and a half hour later a gentleman that i didn t recognise and who way obviously shitfaced literally had a glass of booze in his hand and wa swaying considerably show up at the gate and want to check in i asked if he had is and he said no but i live around the corner my address is i responded that i cannot check anyone in without id and at that point he started demanding to see the new arrival a a rule we don t let unknown randoms into the property which is only sensible so i found the guest and informed her that there wa someone there to see her she didn t want to speak to him so it fell on me to inform the drunken lout that he wa not welcome said drunken lout proceeded to recline in our driveway and shout incomprehensible drunk b at myself his friend who wa with him and the world in general while repeatedly ringing my doorbell my manager and i both attempted to extract him from him apparently comfy spot in our driveway given that we were expecting a guest to be dropped off via taxi in the next few minute we even pointed out a handy spot of pavement not three metre away where he could lounge and rant to his heart s content no dice he ranted about that s my second wife and do you know who i am and fuck you white people year of slavery and i ll come back here and show you something something drunk crap please note i m from south africa and slavery wa never a thing here at least in the literal sense also south africa a a country is le that year old eventually the girl come out of her dorm and say she ll go and talk to him i made it clear to her that we would take no responsibility if she left and that she would not be allowed back on the property if she chose to go out but also that she wa safe with u and we would look after he if she wanted to stay the night she declined and left so i suppose if you got this far where the celebrity component of the tale come in well a you can imagine the ruckus in the driveway managed to attract the attention of pretty much all the staff i wondered why the guy were looking a bit wide eyed at the dust up i wa having but when i wa cashing up they informed me that driveway guy is a fairly well known kwaito artist he had a show back in the s which wa essentially aimed at keeping kid in school and out of drug and gangsterism what a brilliant role model
hi ya ll i just got a job a a busser i m almost finished with training can anyone tell me how many hour a new busser usually get per week we all gotta pay rent
is it just me or are we all over the ridiculous amount of people being sensitive or intolerant or can t have certain ingredient yet we a responsible caring and not to mention respectful server who absolutely believe you have an allergy to dairy go ask chef question about one solitary dish you would like dairy free to your approval we are good to go and you love your meal and you didn t die so yes this is a win for u all and then you eat a whole creme brulee for dessert thanks for stopping by i hate you edit just wanted to do a quick update to reiterate that i wa taking her allergy seriously and i always give people the benefit of the doubt until they are blatantly hypocritical it s not ok to pretend that your preference is just a concerning a someone s actual allergy that can would in fact get them very seriously ill if not handled correctly it s perfectly fine to have preference but stop validating your high maintenance behavior by calling it an allergy
i have worked night audit for almost year at this hotel and have had nothing even close to this ever happen to me luckily the situation wasnt near a bad a it could have been i let this sketchy looking guy in through our front door around tonight even though we were sold out i don t like to question people because guest can get super offended if i ask their info through a locked door and this is generally not a dangerous area immediately i know i have made a mistake because he isnt going to his room he is looking for the bathroom i figure whatever hopefully he will use the bathroom and go away he is in there for a few minute and i dont want some random person loitering in the middle of the night so i go to see what s up i go to the bathroom and it look like he just finishing up and actually wa washing his face and some of his hair too we leave the bathroom and he say he need a towel so i m like ok it s in the bathroom and i go to show him so he get a paper towel and dry off but then he decided he going to sit on the sink counter and i start getting frustrated so i m like ok man it time to go but he doesnt budge and just keep fucking around then out of the fucking blue this guy like hey look at this and he pull out a fucking gun and point it at my face for a second in this kind of nonchalant manner and then go to put it away immediately i m like nope and just walk the fuck out of there to our back office that is protected by a fire door and i call the cop i wait a few minute hear him leaving through the front door wait a little longer and poke my head out to see him being cuffed by the police within view of our entrance door after talking to the police i had to go out and physically tell him he wa banned from the property and he started yelling shit at me when i wa walking away what a wild fucking night i have been considering getting pepper spray and will definitely do that now i dont think the guy had any intention of actually doing anything but if you point a fucking gun at someone there going to be consequence sorry for the shitty formatting i m on my phone and too tired to edit this a ton

we dine frequently at a local mom and pop place down the street from our house we normally have excellent service with every server except one at first we ignored his bad service attributing it to him being inexperienced but consistently we have terrible service from him the straw that broke the camel back wa when we were the only table in the place and he sat on his phone the whole time he didn t even bring u our app or our drink our entree came still no drink no app no silverware even we asked for our drink app and silverware and he brought the silverware and nothing else going back to his phone we went in tonight and got him a our server he s been there a year now so inexperience is no longer an excuse my hubby is very blunt look him in the eye and say could we have a different server please guy asks why and of course hubby is not mincing word and said for almost a year you have given u shit service and we don t like you of course i made him apologize because even if he s a bad service he doesn t deserve someone to be that rude to him hubby and i have been arguing about his behavior tonight i m appalled and think he wa out of line for the way he asked for a new server i told him he needed to discreetly speak to the manager and request another server not berate and humiliate the server the way he did who is right here
i work at a restaurant in nyc and i worked for this place last year before coming back after working at a bar this summer and now i found out the policy ha changed so that tip from previous shift can no longer be split on the clock usually it wouldn t be a big deal because it should be really quick and simple but really out of a team of odd server it s usually me or others that end up doing them everyone want their money but no one want to put in the extra work for it this also mean that cash tip usually get backed up shift per day and yesterday i did day of tip which took me almost hour to do i m just really annoyed because we aren t allowed to do them on the clock so no one want to take the time to do the previous day s tip and they just let them back up then when it come time to do it you have multiple day to go through making individual envelope per person per shift swapping out bill and coin because other people complain when they get too many coin in their tip sorry i just need to vent a little bit

my morning shift wa uneventful aside from charging someone for smoking pot in their room so my gift to you is this nightmare from sunday just about when i wa going to finish checking in a guest and punch out one of my coworkers greeted and began checking in a guy who wa eager to let u know that he had his emotional support chihuahua with him cool that s great but i now have to jump on a live grenade because i m better versed in this and coworker ha had some major family stuff she s been dealing with and i don t expect her to be eager for the pending battle so i speak up and yes i inform the guest that we re happy to have his dog but a emotional support animal are not covered under the ada he will still need to pay the pet deposit his first word towards me are to scream you re wrong i m finishing up with my guest so i respond that i will be happy to discus this with him in a moment but dude isn t having it so i ignore him briefly to get my guest on their way upstairs i ve done this rodeo so many time that i have trophy buckle so i start printing out the faq and such from the ada website highlighting the applicable part and all the while he s yelling about how he ha a disability how he want to speak to a manager how i can t use my brain to answer his question while he s cutting me off and refusing to let me answer any of his question my gm is out of town for the holiday but i text her with shaking hand and ask if she is able to call the hotel because i m being screamed at by a guest i then turn recording on and set my phone down behind the counter because i just have a feeling this will get worse he s continuing to scream that he want a manager on the phone while i m trying to explain that i ve texted her and asked that she call the hotel but she is out of town right now he then accuses me of arguing with him about his disability unknown a it is and i respond that not once have i mentioned or questioned it he informs me that he s recording me on his cell phone and i respond that i am fine with it a i am recording a well more screaming at me that i need to have some empathy more screaming about wanting to speak to a manager and he s added the threat that he s going to sue and then he call me a c game over he say we re not staying here and i say no you aren t i inform him he will not be charged but he is not welcome to stay and need to leave immediately he must have realized what he did because he started arguing with me that he wa a paying customer and i told him he wa not he then tried to claim that i couldn t make him leave because he ha a disability i m making you leave because you re a moldy walnut dude i ended up paging security to escort him out and he yelled at me that i don t deserve my job that i m a f ing b and that he hope i get f ing fired on his way out the door all captured in the recording i wish i could end it here but a couple minute later he snuck back in the secure entry behind another guest and continued yelling at me that he wanted to speak to a manager and that he wa going to sue well that s not even happening now because my gm texted back to say she couldn t call but if he wa using profanity at u he wa absolutely not to be checked in so i page security back and call the police to have him removed from the property i wa supposed to leave work this dude is going to wait outside and hurt me and he proceeds to do what we re all expecting and call corporate to lie about what happened so he got the ada department of corporate involved by claiming we refused to accommodate his disability and while he wa on the phone the police arrived they directed him outside asked him what wa going on and a soon a they found out it wa an esa they backed u up the police informed him that no esas are not covered under the ada yes the hotel can charge a pet fee if they want to and now that you ve been asked to leave if you return you will be arrested they stick around to make sure he doe leave then come inside to discus the situation with u noting that we had the ada paper on the counter and it seemed like we were well prepared for the issue sidenote my state passed a law making it illegal to portray a non service animal a a service animal last year punishable by fine they wish u well and i wait for the call from corporate it doesn t take long for that call to come and once i explain what happened the person on the other end literally tell me not to even worry about this case i text my gm to loop her in and we make arrangement to talk before she email the aborted guest later i send her the recording and she is pretty horrified the next day after she responds to the guest i find out that he now ha a flag on his membership account to basically refuse to let him open complaint ticket merry christmas

um first reddit post after seeing similar story i felt like i should bring this one here i have many more if anyone would want me to write them down this is just the most recent a of now formatting apology i m on mobile oh and english is my first language so tear me up about a month ago while hosting at a fake italian restaurant i wa taking an older man and his wife to a booth the only booth we had availiable which wasn t dirty wa in the caf area what we call our bar area i asked the wife if this wa okay and she said yes the man said nothing i attempted to take them to the booth and a i wa sitting the silverware down the man began to berate me you are really trying to seat u in the corner of the damn bar you are so disrespectful and disgusting to your elder find u a new table now out there he gestured to the dining room i dont deal well with stress i have severe social and pressure based anxiety which i have to take xanax for at the beginning of each day but the dose is only strong enough to keep me calm during normal what shouldn t be stressful event so getting yelled at infront of an entire restaurant will definitely still set me off my face wa red and i felt hot a i took him to a dirty booth in the dining room and quietly told him i m sorry sir i will be right back to clean this off for you well he did not like this a he continued his ranting and raving at me about how unprepared i wa how they should not have to wait on a booth to be cleaned and how he could have my job taken from me for being so incompetent i know it isn t my fault a the busser hasnt been able to get to the table yet but being yelled at and humiliated wa too much and i actually started cry on the job yeah i m an adult that make it worse i cried silently but i m sure it wa visible while i got their table ready for them and the guy seemed satisfied the waitress taking them told me not to worry and took her time to check her other table before greeting them making them wait minute but i m unsure if it really did anything for them may i add that the wife never spoke up at all while the husband tore me a new one yeah she just let it happen anyway word got back to my manager about what happened the next day and now when it get busy they take me off the floor and have me roll silverware because they don t think i can handle a rush anymore i can and i m fine during rush how that man treated me is what set me off but nothing can be done now i guess and i will just have to keep being humiliated during rush hour by being hidden away in the back
so i work in a small grocery store cafe and this evening a woman walk in just before we were about to close i wa at the till so she come up to me and start telling me something about a fire next door and she wa locked out of her house and we needed to help her i didn t really understand what she wa saying but wa definitely concerned and my immediate question wa whether she had called the fire brigade the conversation went something like this lady i can t call the fire brigade they won t come me i can assure you they will i live around here and have had to call before if there s any chance of a fire they will definitely come lady i ve called them already they said they won t come at this point my colleague and manager were at the till and we were all super confused after some more questioning we finally got the truth out she had heard a fire alarm thinking her neighbour house wa on fire she went out into the hallway to have a look after knocking on her neighbour door they told her it wa just from cooking when she turn around she realises she s locked herself out of her house with no phone or money shit situation many of u have been there i told her she just needed to call a locksmith but she said it wa too expensive in the end she convinced my co worker to go with her to try and help her break in even though she had previously said her neighbour tried and she had told him to stop the whole thing wa so confusing and also annoying a i ended up being like min later out because of her slowing everyone down i understand it s annoying to be locked out and i would have more than happily let her use the shop phone or mine but to expect some random people to come and fix your problem when you could literally fix it yourself by calling a locksmith is beyond me maybe i m being harsh but honestly she had so many other option neighbour locksmith i hate how people expect customer service worker to fix literally every problem in their life and the fact she wanted the fire brigade to come out to her house and break in just because she didn t want to pay is another level of selfish i wish people would take more responsibility and not expect everyone else to fix their problem for them
so i have an interview at an upscale sushi restaurant in manhattan i m pretty excited and it look promising a i wa looking more into them online then i saw the menu and it state that it is a no tipping restaurant i ve worked at restaurant where i could make an hour hr base pay in nyc and fair pretty well i m just wondering how restaurant that have hospitality included in the menu price compete for server in other place to those that do work at a no tipping establishment how doe it work do you get paid will comparatively to restaurant that traditionally do
to start with this probably doe happen often enough that it s not that exciting but i still loved it when this happened so a couple of military guy come into the restaurant wearing their full regalia they were on leave or something and we were a pretty popular tourist spot they get their food they are all having a great time and finally after an hour or so they get up to pay well a grandmother from another table had seen that group in their military garb and wa kind enough to pay for both her table of and their table of the military guy were really thankful and they ended up leaving a hefty tip along with the old lady a well this wa one of the few moment that made me like customer service
so it s been a few month since my employer locked the door and never came back i have since found another job outside the service industry i have a steady m f schedule better pay and i don t interact with the general public basically i now have what a lot of u dream of but i still miss it the fast pace the chaos hell i even miss a couple of karen just cause they made the night interesting lol i also noticed all my relationship from work have just fizzled out because the job wa what held u together it s crazy to go from spending hour a week and countless after hour partying with the same people to barely speaking to each other i have thought about picking up a part time gig just for the hell of it any other former long term server bartender have the same feeling when you finally left
on the heel of this past month i ve been told this wa one of our busiest in recent past i ve feel the need to unwind from it coming into the spring season and had a few moment to share to bring you folk some entertainment for context my property is a locally owned boutique motel in the heart of downtown in my area we re a small remodeled travelodge and not part of any brand or chain this mean while we re still found through the third party site and have our own website we re not part of any brand or chain so there s no corporate overlord making decision from an ivory tower i wouldn t call u so much a family establishment a we re more the kind of place you come to when you want to get away from the kid for a night and drink but not have to worry about the drive back we re a whole lot cheaper than a duo thing is being a downtown property we re limited on our parking we ve more room than parking space and the city tends to shrug their shoulder at the situation and say just use the street which is fine most night but it ha it s own difficulty that will become relevant later on to the story amp x b weekend one fat tuesday but day early a big thing in my part of the u is marti gras we re only a half day drive to new orleans and there s some more than others that take the season seriously king cake louis armstrong album the whole shebang of nola debauchery minus the public flashing i m not too familiar with the culture but there are group involved with the parade and such are split up among what they call a crewe sic mostly they re just rich white boomer who get together and blow a bunch of money on a float and get drunk together one such group i ll call crewe de karen every year they book u out completely for one weekend when they have one of their ball i wa terrified of this group from the moment i started because they had every sign of the entitled guest whenever they d call they always expected me to know every detail about their stay just by giving me their name an example of one of my first call from them me standard phone greeting how can i help you cdk already yelling yeah john smith just called me and he s telling me you told him you ain t got room we ve blocked x for the crewe of karen and me i sort of cut him off sir sir i need you to slow down because i personally never told anyone that i m not sure who did but from looking at the availability right now it appears we re overbooked this went on for a bit and i explain that i m kinda the new guy and not too familiar with how this certain event is ran but would have the manager call them in the morning the others weren t so hostile but it wa clear their communication is broken because one would book an extra or room for their friend only for that friend to call and make reservation for themselves at one point because of this there wa another argument with the manager when they canceled some room for the people who d already booked themselves others heard on their facebook group that there were cancellation so people tried jumping in where there wa really nothing opening up this wa all happening in the fall of last year during the month in between our manager decides to just be the one to handle the booking for that group nobody else wa to do anything about their reservation sadly this doesn t lead into it being more problem a he really busted his as dealing with every one of them and kept it well organized from there when the day finally came i prepared for the worst upon arrival i find our parking lot packed full not just with car but with drunk karen and chad our on our patio they d even brought their own grill turn out most all of them had checked in already and were well into their weekend of day drinking they wound up being perfectly pleasant and didn t cause a single problem i m actually looking forward to them coming on next year amp x b week v day honestly not much to write home about sorry to disappoint the only odd thing i remember wa a conversation with a guest about how he wa staying that night to get away from his wife she d apparently had the flu and due to the monthly new cycle that meant he thought it d best to stay away amp x b week the parade these are truly my nightmare anytime the city throw a parade it s guaranteed to pas right in front of the hotel this usually mean we become more of a public bathroom than a motel also this wasn t just one parade it wa two one on friday night the other saturday afternoon now a lot of people come and stay with u because of the super convenient location some could just put up a lawn chair at their front door and have a good view from there if you re not looking to get bead or moonpies but mostly people think that by staying here will buy them right to our parking lot thing is they also invite there friend to come and park here a well remember when i mentioned how the city shrug and say just use the street that help nothing when that street overflow is blocked off so the parade can pas and i m the one people look at to find an answer when there s nothing available i didn t even want to think about finding parking and luckily it wa a cheap lyft ride it wa hectic loud and obnoxious but we pulled through it wa one of the first weekend i didn t have to handle the shift by myself we even doubled our money just with the manager out front selling beer during the saturday parade amp x b week comic con the last weekend wa our annual comic con this i thought would be the easiest of them all geek are pretty chill right all my geeky friend are turn out i wa very wrong most every who stayed either checked in thursday or friday and just stayed the whole weekend i think that sat i had three reservation checkins on a sold out night friday our city also through one of it s monthly thing it s a night where all the downtown art gallery open their door and they shut down part of the street and the restaurant will pull out some table out there this happens a few block down so we re not blocked off like we are on the parade but the increase in people coming to downtown mean more of that street parking the city tell u to use is already in use this brought the highlight of confrontation of my story in walk who i ll dub sharon amp thad thad walk in with sharon behind them so named because sharon fit a few of the check mark of a karen but wasn t the one demanding answer she really only tried to reign in thad during his hostility but clearly wasn t happy thad on the other hand walk in like a traumatized bull to me like i m dressed a matador and huff thad we have reservation but there is absolutely no parking out there i mean none me well i m sorry sir if there s nothing in the parking lot all that s left is the street thad there isn t any even there someone in that lot shouldn t be here me all of those car are our guest i m sorry but we re a downtown property that s limited on our parking we re quite open about our free parking is first come first serve sharon it didn t say that when we booked me seeing that they booked third party we cannot be responsible for what third party advertised thad your fucking manager told u that we d have parking i m sorry i don t cuss but you pushed me too far me i m sorry sir but i can t bend space and time a much a i d like to we re a downtown property with a convention three block away and the city is doing their gallery night there is nothing i can do for parking now i called this guy thad because while he had the personality of a hyper agressive chad he had the physical physique of a hershey s kiss with leg and he routinely skip leg day i have a feeling he tends to use his size to intimidate while not having to keep promise he can t keep he wa tall about but a my username suggests i m no small fry either i m not saying i m in better shape but people tend to think twice before they get too froggy with a guy my size i wa also confident i could run faster scared than he can mad and i m the smoker between u at this point thad start kicking at the counter like a baseball coach kicking at the sand a he argues with the umpire thad we called and asked if there would be parking for two car your manager told u you wouldn t and that everyone would get one parking spot sharon to thad now stop hand me the info to finish the checkin basically it boiled down to a miscommunication where they assumed the room guaranteed them a spot it go on like this because his tantrum wa a bit amusing to me right up until thad i m gonna go online and destroy this place s reputation with review at that point i gave him a death glare had i not had just clicked the button to charge the third party card i would ve thrown his as out right then i had taken this a he wa going to start astroturfing and going on to make complaint that while damning didn t really exist but since it wa a third party order and we had the money anyway i tell him the manager will be around in the morning and give them their room key i wait a few minute after while they were unloading out front and i go back out to give the last option i had i explained that i d spoken to the owner and they could park on the side of our patio out front a place where we re really not supposed to park there but i had no other option and the owner did give me the approval to do this a little while earlier in the night thad actually apologized to me much to my surprise he admitted to knowing it s not my fault but he d just been on the road hour to get here he would ve come sooner had he known the parking wa thistight i thought cool that s the end of that all wa well and good right amp x b right amp x b nope i come back the next day and during my start of shift briefing i m told what happened that morning apparently we re a roach infested cesspool because the shower only came to his mid chest granted a the fate would have it he got the one room at our place that hadn t had a detachable shower head installed on it yet however a i m sure my homies at r tall could agree with me this is all too common of a problem when you re above washing your hair can be a backbreaking task unless you want soap in your eye they decided that morning that they weren t going to stay so effectively they got a free night out of u which is fine but i did warn my manager that he d threatened to go and talk shit in our review to which the manager replied that since he wa given a full refund he won t be allowed to review small victory i suppose
first time poster and on mobile apologize for format now then onto the story so this happened today actually i work at an applebees and a you know we have late night half apps that usually draw in herd of high schoolers and college student today wa a slow day and i had just gotten a table of soon to be while waiting for the rest of their party more people walk in and wait second before seating themselves in the closed area of my section i walk over kindly ask them to move to the open area which they agree and this dude is so high he s somewhere around jupiter right now so when i seat them i ask for their drink a per normal girl asks for hot chocolate guy asks for watermelon margarita which we dont have and rather than look at the listed flavor on the drink menu just asks what we have which is understandable i m used to it but my mind is still not at full capacity after recovering from a cold i get their drink the rest of the party of show up at my first table and i get them their water with lemon which will always annoy me still have no idea why here s the kicker i bring high table their drink and ask what they d want a it turn out they didnt want half apps they wanted to read from the regular menu which they never got because they sat themselves and never brought it to my attention i grab those and silverware to save me another request later and let them do their thing i turn around to party table nobody know what they want understandable i ll give them a few minute i come back check on party table first since i believe theyll be quick still no decision i ll check back later high table want a for no surprise there but they think that the side are locked in to mashed potato and broccoli a shown on the picture no that s just an example i explain that they can choose any two side and direct them to the page guy only order one and close the menu so i ask him if he would like a second one and exclaims in surprise that he didnt know you got two girl wa completely clueless a to where the side were even though i flipped to them right in front of her face they finally get everything in after some much needed explanation a to how a menu work i write it down and turn to party table the same guy ha been staring at the half apps menu since my second check back and didnt even pas it on to anyone else so the rest were still clueless i ll come back in another few minute this is my fourth time checking back and a it turn out the guy hogging the menu cant have any of it so it wa basically a major waste of time there and the girl he showed up with didnt want anything either so alright then the other two finally order something but the first guy decides to point to the menu hold it up and say this thing here at the bottom dude it ha a name in bold that everyone know and isnt complicated at all classic combo sampler at least the girl made it easy with mozzarella stick by the time i got to my po system i just hit my head against it and stayed there for a solid second wondering what in the world just happened the rest of the night wasnt a bad i ran out the food high dude for some reason didnt recognize his loaded baked potato which he showed excitement towards when ordering it and set it to the side only to ask for a box later still unsure on what happened there high table payed and left first leaving about a tip which i appreciated party table decided to pay and then stay damn near till closing they only decided to leave when i began flipping table over in order to clean under them for the final touch the moment they left i collected the checkbook to get my signed receipt when i see someone left their card now you might be thinking this is normal but hear me out they left their card when i had placed it in front of the receipt so you would need to move it in order to sign not to mention the card wa designed with a brightly colored butterfly and a purple flower how in the world do you miss that luckily i caught up to them in the parking lot returned the card did my closing work and finally went home to type this right here on a subreddit i found by complete accident thank you for reading

hi bank manager here just read something in r legaladvise about a server being held responsible for talking a fake but their employer hasn t given them a pen to check the bill in case you don t know the only thing the marker check is the paper u bill are made in a special cotton blend paper which is why they survive your laundry cycle and that is what the bill is detecting but bill can be washed which is when they bleach a low denomination bill and print a higher one on top your pen won t notice that so try to be very familiar with the security feature on each denomination you can find them online or your friendly banker can probably show you what to look for good luck
during my shift on friday i endured one of the most bizarre exchange with a guest i ve had yet behold the conversation a very nondescript looking lady came to check out of her room me good morning how ha your stay been guest well i think somebody came into my room during the night me oh that doesn t sound good did you see or hear anyone enter the room guest no me have you provided anyone else with a key to your room guest no me ok can you explain what give you the impression that someone entered your room i should also point out that her room wa on an upper floor and the window do not open guest well there s some stuff in my bag which wasn t there before me that seems very unusual what kind of thing guest there s an umbrella in my bag i definitely didn t pack my umbrella and there s some money which wasn t there before me so you re saying you believe somebody entered your room during the night and put money in your bag guest i know it sound a little far fetched at this point my hhk ha moved away from the desk to laugh guest do you have any cctv me sadly it doesn t cover the hallway only the reception and car park guest clearly doesn t believe me so i rotate the cctv monitor so she can see for herself guest ok well what else can you do me i can check the access history on the door a it s a digital lock and find out which key have been used on it but this isn t a quick process so can i call you when i ve had a look guest agrees to leave her number and head off i audit the lock to humour her and cover my own as and of course the only us were by the guest when she entered the room and by hk who entered after she checked out when querying her booking i found that she wa a walk in why is it always the walk in
i worked for many year a a corporate guest relation coordinator for a very high end hotel chain of about property one day i get a call from a gentleman claiming he wa way overcharged for his room and want me to immediately fix the charge it had been about a week since he checked out i got all of his information and told him i would need to call him back because i needed to contact the hotel a i am not on property this really upset him but i couldn t just give him a refund without knowing anything i couldn t access the front desk system to see a breakdown of the charge i could only see his reservation after like minute of arguing with me he finally accepted he would have to wait for resolution i could just sense this guy wasn t telling me the whole story i called the fom and she wa completely floored that this guest had the ball to complain you see the guest in question let s call him mr ball wa staying during a very big city wide party event imagine a prime location hotel for mardi gras or southbysouthwest and during this time all guest checking into the fancy pant hotel are notified of the no party policy and they are required to sign a waiver stating they are financially responsible for blah blah blah people are not even allowed into the hotel without a card key or reservation mr ball a guy in his mid late s got really drunk and thought it would be amusing to run up and down the hotel hallway completely naked and knock on door the cop were called mr ball wa hauled away still naked and the other guest in his room were asked to leave the room on either side of his were very upset and of course they complained which resulted in the front desk comping their room but instead of actually comping they transferred the cost of their room to mr ball room because he wa fully responsible for the complaint he wa told this by the hotel this is what no party waiver is for i called mr ball and told him i knew of the entire situation and he would not be getting a refund he wa completely unapologetic for his behavior it wasn t his fault he can t be held responsible why are we charging him so much when he didn t actually damage anything in his room it s not fair etc etc i wasn t having any of it i can smell b from a mile away he tried to talk to someone else and even used our online complaint submission form but i wa the only gr coordinator so basically every communication came to me he called the reservation center and wa promptly transferred to me he started to tell his fictional half story and i wa like ummm yes mr ball i am familiar i just spoke with you yesterday every avenue he tried to take brought him back to me which just made him more and more angry mr ball then tried to dispute the charge with his credit card a a fraudulent charge the fom quickly sent over documentation and it wa denied due to the fact that we got his signature at check in we swiped his physical card we had his signature on the no party agreement and a police report to go along with that mr ball called again this time he tried to bully me into giving his money back of my day wa dealing with rich angry guest so i wa completely unfazed mr ball finally shout i ve got a lawyer and i m going to sue you and your hotel you can t do this to me i calmly respond if that is what you want to do i would be happy to provide you with the phone number for our legal team however you should know that once our lawyer are involved i can no longer speak with you about this all communication will have to be through the legal office this wa standard policy mr ball started to cry he wa literally bawling and begging me to just refund his card and he would never do it again a though never doing it again matter when he wa already given a lifetime ban from the property he cried that he couldn t afford the charge we were ruining his life ruining his entire life over nothing keep in mind that the total charge wa around usd his room alone wa like tax fee for one night i had been dealing with this guy on and off for way too long and i straight out told him dude you signed the agreement and were warned ahead of time that you would be responsible for your action we had to comp room because you thought it would be funny to run around naked your neighbor who were trying to sleep and had young child in their room did not find it amusing i don t understand why you think that the hotel should be financially responsible for your mistake because that is exactly what you are asking you are absolutely not going to get a refund and you need to accept that he hung up on me and i never heard from him again amp x b amp x b i just found this sub and i love it i worked front desk reservation and corporate office for many year i have a ton of horror story i hope this is okay to post since i wasn t actually at the front desk when it happened
today i quit my job it s not that i hated it or anything i think i m pretty decent at serving i hate that i m leaving my work short handed but i ve always told myself that school come first i m set to graduate in may if i make it through this semester and with my current workload it s not feasible to work a well after a breakdown yesterday i decided that i couldn t work there anymore i m getting out hopefully forever but i adore this sub and wish everyone the best
sorry this is a little long so it s the middle of our dinner rush and i m in the busiest section i m wrapping up my first round of table turning and i know i m about to get flat sat one of the table is usually a four top but because we have a lot of reservation we split it into two which is suuuuper annoying because it s the beginning of an l shaped banquet and now the table in the corner is super hard to access anyway i have an extra table now and i m being quadruple sat dope what even is being weeded i go and greet this table of four couple in their early mid thirty and the guy parent they re all lovely they order their drink and off i go back into the weed when i go to deliver said drink i somehow manage to spill a drink off my tray while putting another drink down and it fell onto the table causing the candle to tip over and spill wax across the middle of the table so now there s not only a drink with pebble ice all over the table there s also wax i swear it happened in slow mo in my head i felt so terrible and i apologized profusely they were so sweet they didn t even flinch when i spilled and were totally cool about everything i made some self deprecating joke about it while actually dying of embarrassment inside the guy who s drink it wa even took a sip of the rest of the drink that wa in the glass and made a joke about it being a taste like i had poured for the father who ordered a glass of wine anyway meal go on everything s great the younger woman asks for a mocktail and love it they take food to go business a usual when i drop the check i say i m so sorry again about the spill thank you so much for being so cool about it and they insisted it wa no worry at all after they leave our busser food runner come up to me and is like hey guess how much that table left for you a a tip and i wa like oh god i hope they weren t secretly pissed they left me on a tab i wa so touched i don t even know why they did it other than to show they were cool about the spill but even a tip would have said that but a tip i wa so touched it really helped get me through the rest of the shift i recently got a concussion and tonight i wa having really bad memory issue and kept forgetting to put order in luckily i write everything down always and wa able to cover my own as a few time i wa really beating myself up for it internally but their gesture wa so sweet and it meant a lot to me sometimes it s nice to be reminded the service industry isn t all horror story and shitty people
look i get it you have a child under the age of you re stuck at home a lot you want to go enjoy a saturday lunch with your friend i like kid i like serving kid and making face at baby what i don t like is cleaning up after you for the love of all thing holy why did you give your son a crumbly chocolate chip cookie thing to eat why did you break it up and serve it to him directly on the table even when i offered you a plate you let him throw those crumbly cookie piece onto the floor then stepped on then so much that they got ground into the carpet and your friend she put down some weird plastic thing that stuck to the table so her baby didn t have to eat off it but when she left she didn t roll it nicely to keep the food inside she just crumpled it and let it stick to all the dish left on your table there wa food all over the floor within in a four foot radius of your large table some were giant chunk of cookie that wouldn t have been hard for you to quickly pick up but honestly it s fine i can deal with spending ten minute scrubbing the chocolate out of the floor when i m the only server having to vacuum in the middle of the day and having to cart high chair across the room for you but after all that you didn t even leave me i know you know it wa a mess because you and your friend both apologized to me a you left you knew you were leaving me to deal with it and you didn t think that wa worth an extra dollar or two come on
possible trigger warning so i wa working the shift at my hotel a couple year ago and a woman dressed a little odd i ll call her odd lady or ol for short come in from outside and go straight to the breakfast room because we are located downtown in a city we had to always watch people going into the breakfast room the breakfast lady talked to her before i had to and we thought she wa about to leave but instead she come up to the front desk and here s how our conversation went me good morning how can i help you today ol whispering yes i have just been raped and i need a place to stay can you give me a room me i am so sorry to hear this but no i cant give you a room i can however call the police or an ambulance ol no i need a room here the police wont help me and neither will the hospital me well the rate for a room is about a night and we don t do check in till but i can make an exception ol no i dont have any money i need the room for free and it should be free because i wa just raped me i cant do that but why dont i call the woman shelter for you and i m sure they can help you so i dialed the woman shelter and they sent a cab for her and seemed to be familiar with her i hope she wasnt actually raped i think she wa homeless and desperate for a warm place to say

in the s i wa a front office supervisor at a busy downtown star hotel in a northern canadian city each summer our city had a festival for street performer it ran for about day and wa held in a city park only a block from our hotel a tourism wa not one of our larger segment summer were often slow and sale would offer the street performer a group rate i initially questioned whether we wanted to have this segment of traveller stay in the hotel and whether they could really afford it but a i found out they were not only exceptionally nice and well mannered people but that street performing at festival wa also extremely lucrative some people pulled in a day in tip i m sure it wa an opportunity for these folk to stay at a much better class of hotel than they normally would and it wa enthusiastically received resulting in u being sold out for most of the day stretch i wa on a to shift one day the second day of the day festival thing were slow at the desk a we were sold right out out of room housekeeping bell staff room service and f amp amp amp amp b were a to be expected hopping the th room at this hotel wa called the royal suite room it wa a luxuriously appointed room that wa three time the size of a normal room and wa two story tall with floor to ceiling window it connected to the ambassador suite that contained a murphy bed and a corner king suite on the other side that were on the same floor and via a sweeping circular staircase to the ambassador suite on the th floor the royal suite itself however did not have a bed or a bedroom when it needed a bed it wa sold with one of the connecting bedroom it did have a dining room table for and a very large sectional sofa that could seat at least a dozen people around a inch projection screen tv by rearranging the furniture a space could be created where you could set up a small theater or u shape with some a v so you could use it a a small meeting room that wa often utilized a a meeting space for smaller but higher end event client only once in the five year that i worked at this hotel did i see the entire four room complex rented out it wa when a extremely well known piano playing performer with a penchant for weird eyeglass stayed in our hotel we had to bring in a dismantled grand piano and set it up in the royal suite and have a piano tuner come in however that is another story for another day the cost wa a night a substantial amount in the s but i digress we rarely sold the royal suite a a bedroom although in extreme case we sometimes would put a rollaway in there so we are working the evening shift and we only had a handful of departure and arrival that day and they were already in so i wa surprised when a fellow approached the desk said he wa checking in and handed me his confirmation number skeptical i punched in the confirmation number and found that he did indeed have a reservation sadly it wa for day ago he s already been charged a a one night guaranteed no show but in those pre internet day you really only saw your credit card statement once a month so he probably didn t even know about the charge yet i could see in the reservation segment code field that this reservation had come from a travel agent again those day were pre internet they were only two way to book a hotel room through our central reservation number or through a travel agent the ta s had access to our rack system and could see availability and could make reservation directly those reservation would still need to be vetted by an actual reservation agent and transferred into the system on this reservation the date were either transposed june july error or just outright incorrect this could have happened at the ta level or when it wa moved over no way of knowing until re opened the next day either way here wa a fellow standing in front of me expecting to stay here for over a week and did not have a room i had fielded a couple of call from other hotel that evening inquiring a to whether we had room so i knew they were full too the city wa sro the fellow wa understandably upset although more of the circumstance then at anyone in particular he wa coming from a similar street performer festival in germany and had been travelling for two day he didn t have much fight left in him i decided i would give him the royal suite and put a rollaway in it he wa paying our rack rate of not the group rate of so it seemed fair the group block wa filled so i couldn t even offer him that rate i told him all about it and also about the rollaway bed which he wasn t too keen on it first until i reassured him that it wa exactly like one of our standard bed it wa just on wheel it wasn t like the cot our parent had for company that wa inch thick i reassured him that he would get a good night sleep i checked him in his departure date wa day away and i told him we had occupancy in about three day and i would move him to a normal room type at that time i sent a note to the fom to see if we could get the gns charge either refunded or applied to his current stay it wa the standard of the hotel at the time that about minute after check in the switchboard operator would call the room and make sure that everything wa satisfactory the switchboard wa right behind the front desk and we could often hear the operator conversation especially if the door to the back office wa propped open which we always did i heard the operator making a call and addressing the royal suite guest and by the sound of her response he absolutely loved the room due to in house request housekeeping wa backed up and a such it took about a half an hour for them to get to putting the bed in his room he stopped by the desk about two hour later on his way to the pub and gushed a little more about how awesome the room wa and how comfortable the bed wa we had a happy guest and we had a sold out night everybody wa happy three day later occupancy fell to the high s but i did have a few standard king available so i called him with the intention of moving him to a room with a real bed i offered to have the bellman come up and assist him in moving to a standard king size room which coincidentally wa on the same floor he wa already on and he could have that room for the duration of his stay about seven day at that point he said he wa happy to stay where he wa the bed wa very comfortable and that hotel room wa bigger than his house he wa extremely happy and didn t want to go anywhere he said if it wa all the same with me he wa perfectly happy to stay exactly where he wa for the duration of his stay i told him i would check and if the room wa not booked for anything else he wa welcome to stay there i put in a quick call to both sale and to banquet who would often schedule meeting for that space but not tell room about it but it wa free and clear i called back to the room left a message telling the guest that we would not be moving him and to enjoy the rest of his stay i also told him our front office manager had agreed to apply the gns charge to his current stay all in all i think this guy made out pretty good especially for someone showing up for a sold out city with a week old room reservation i never heard another word out of him and he checked out on a shift that i wa not on in those pre internet day the channel a hotel had for feedback were pretty limited we had comment card in the room and that wa about it occasionally if someone wa very upset they would contact our corporate office in writing at that time our ho wa in england even le frequently an extremely happy guest would also contact them these comment would be forwarded to u via teletype machine and be part of an about page report that we would download from them every day during the night audit shift high tech for the time so about three month after this guest stay the flag report show that he had written corporate to complain bitterly about the substandard condition he wa forced to exist in during his time with u calling me out by name he singled me out a the villain who forced him to stay in a room that horror of horror didn t even have a real bed and then i made him sleep on a cot in his word worse then the bed i had to sleep on at boy camp when i wa eight year old the room wa trashy dirty outdated poorly decorated nothing worked etc etc i made no offer to reduce his rate and he wa overcharged because he wa not offered the group rate he qualified for he wa demanding his entire stay be refunded to him we reported back the actual fact to corporate ultimately they denied his claim i remember it came up at the front office meeting and we all just shook our head at the audacity of this guy we all agreed that we would file it under no good deed go unpunished and try not to let it destroy our collective faith in humanity
the suit story from the other day reminded me of this this wa during a time when i wa gm we are near the highway but not too near kinda tucked away but convenient near a residential area lot of tree not a lot of traffic passing by a the street to get to u pretty much dead end important to the story i m off and about doing errand get back to the property a little before noon and the front desk person tell me of a weird interaction some guy not a guest come in very hard to understand mumbler short kinda dirty looking she think he s asking about this empty lot behind our property and she think he asked if he can eat his lunch there confused she say suuuuuure that empty lot behind u isn t ours go right ahead he leaf ok weird i do some paperwork and get a deposit ready to go to the bank a few minute later the hhk come to me and asks about the tent in the back parking lot what what tent you know one of those like awning that you stake out when you have a big picnic or something so you can sit under it on bench maybe have your grill under there and not get rained on no idea what she s talking about but i m about ready to head to the bank i ll check it out i go out there and mumbler is parked in our back parking lot trunk of his car open setting up a little hot dog stand thing his car is packed probably life out of it he ha a portable grill on a card table and a little tent he s already unfolded and put up ha a little cooler to the side and a couple package of the cheapest hot dog from the dollar store and a few package of hot dog bun condiment etc i ask the guy what the heck he s doing and he say he s going to sell hot dog he say the girl at the front desk said he could i tell him first off i m the gm and i am the one he should be asking nd i tell him i talked to the girl at the front desk and she for sure didn t say you could set up a little hot dog stand out of the trunk of your car in our back lot he try to tell me that he thought this back parking lot wa public property which it clearly is not i tell him i m heading to the bank and when i get back he need to be gone or i ll have the cop remove him which he did thankfully what really made me shake my head wa his thinking he go to all this trouble to set this up and who doe he think he s going to sell to maybe the housekeeper want to buy a hot dog from the trunk of a dirty car doe he think i m going to allow him to be panhandling to my guest trying to sell hot dog maybe he make enough money for a couple gallon of gas to head on down the road and do it again you can t see his tent from the front of the building and there s no one going down that road that s going to pull in because they see a tent anyway pop up hot dog vendor wa the talk that week and i made sure that all the front desk knew that non guest can t set up business in our parking lot out of their trunk from now on in case anybody didn t know that already

hey all i m helping my new restaurant develop a new job position corporate ha eliminated traditional bussers or expo but we aren t opposed to bringing back those term this position will be staffed from existing server so it will take away from their serving shift usually shift per server each week unless the server only work a few shift a week then they won t have to do this tip are around shift this is basically the job duty what would you describe the position a or the job title be most like foh or boh ask bar if they need help during shift wash and stock bar dish empty garbage throughout shfit restock all pot pan dish and glass ware run food and drink bus clean and reset table keep ice filled this position doe get paid minimum wage and voluntarily tipped out at of sale but usually it s more like dollar from each person with a staff of about severs and bartender thought

warning a bit long i am in my s and i have been working in hotel since i have worked multiple position within hotel pretty much everything but maintenance and upper management i have generally worked at larger hotel that have a lot of room restaurant conference center etc i know how to do my job and i do it very well i have even learned a nd language to help me in my career and i am currently working on a rd i wa hired at a much smaller property than i am used to in october of last year my experience made me a shoo in and i wa hired on the spot by my front office manager this is my fom s very first role a a manager and she ha quite literally le than half of the experience that i do fom wa being mentored at the time by the hotel s housekeeping manager who also doe not have the same amount of experience that i do the two of them are thick a thief having worked together for the past couple of year this cause them to act very clique y the first couple of week at my new property are fine i work diligently trying to prove myself during my interview fom did not grant me the pay rate i had asked saying the general manager like to see people prove themselves first fair enough a time go on thing change fom and hskpg manager s true color show i see them gossiping about other employee huddling outside the general manager s door listening in on his phone conversation blatantly avoiding their own responsibility and passing them off on others passing the buck blaming other people for their own mistake etc when this behavior end up being aimed at me i immediately put my foot down and stand up for myself i question their tactic deny their accusation of any wrongdoing they try to pin on me obviously i ended up on their bad side more time pass and thing get a bit worse micro management blame culture kiss up kick down strategy basically mean acting like the teacher pet with the gm so when you try to tell gm what they re up to he doesn t believe anything because he already ha a biased opinion i finally grow tired of it and corner the gm alone one day to discus the issue gm hears me out but offer up really unprofessional feedback oh that s just how they are you have to build up a relationship with them are you sure they aren t just teasing rly yes gm i am sure gm say he will speak to them about it a few day later and about every other week thereafter fom come to me with verbal warning that were typed on paper with the title disciplinary notice for thing i had done or had not done but all of which were based off of mismanagement example fom order u a front desk agent to stay behind the desk unless guest need u but then we get written up when hskpg manager called the front desk and we weren t there because we were off fulfilling a guest request contradictory assignment delegation hskpg manager want front desk agent to start taking on more housekeeping responsibility so she start adding more task to our workload but we then end up getting spoken to by fom for not being at the desk or not being able to finish our own task everything wa very confusing and frustrating i start getting nervous for my job when these verbal warning start coming regularly i try to talk to fom and hskpg manager about it with no result once again i speak with my gm he assures me he will talk to them again the next day i come into work and within the first minute hskpg manager start making nasty remark toward me directly quoting the phrase i had used when i spoke with gm indication to me that he had spoken with them the negative treatment continues it becomes apparent that gm ha no control over these girl i decide to email our corporate hr rep ccing my gm this is when thing became very bad gm start acting like my fom and hskpg manager fom writes me up over something trivial that would never have happened if hskpg manager had followed proper procedure and had done her job correctly i point this out to gm and gm get irritated saying that i don t even care about what i did and i am just going to do what i want gm end up having fom and hskpg manager s back a couple of day later gm and i meet at the corporate office for the meeting i had requested for this meeting i bring a folder full of documented proof of fom and hskpg manager s bullying along with literature on workplace bullying for education purpose the meeting did not go well at all gm interrupted me repeatedly argues almost everything i said tried poking hole in every story i tried telling corporate hr rep gm and hr rep also have been working at the company together for several year hr rep notice how exasperated i am becoming with gm s behavior and point it out comparing me to her own daughter it felt very condescending i walk out of the meeting feeling defeated and i am still stuck in the same rut i wa trying to get out of meanwhile i notice thing at work file with my name on them written up by fom and saved to folder on the desktop that i have access to one file in particular wa titled fom s poetry about avengedcenterfold it wa a word document that outlined every single note they had ever written to the front desk agent in our pas down log a little journal we write in to keep each other informed of happening and change except the document wa worded in a way that seemed that the note were only meant for me this document made it seem a though they found me incompetent and were building up a case against me i now feel a though there is a target on my back and i m not sure what to do workplace bullying is not illegal it make me so angry that these girl are getting away with treating me this way i have been keeping track of their own mistake and their blatant bullying thinking i can use it to show hr if they do find an excuse to fire me i have printed negative review from guest documented proof of them lying about me or what i have done example document said money wa missing from the cash drawer and i had been working the previous shift

hi folk i m not from the u but live here currently where i m from tipping is the exception and not the rule it s done only for exceptional service my understanding is that in the u server can be paid le than minimum wage and so you tip your server to make up for the difference in their wage is this true if that s the case why aren t people lobbying to make minimum wage standard also it seems like in certain state minimum wage is standard wa for example are expectation for tipping different in these area

since this is one of the biggest restaurant related sub i m posting this notification we got from our accountant coronavirus and it impact on restaurant i just wanted to reach out and give you all a head up on what s going on out there right now with the coronavirus issue and restaurant in particular we are hearing that various city are preparing a protocol if a restaurant is named a a location where the virus ha spread from it s pretty brutal closure for up to day minimum and all employee will need to be tested before returning to work two bad issue there insurance doesn t cover the closure it is excluded on business interruption coverage and if employee get the virus at work it is probably a work comp claim so with that environment pending it is crucial that restaurant put in place some protocol immediately while we work our way through this issue at a minimum i would suggest the following a notification to all employee regarding hand washing with hot soapy water should be done at a minimum every fifteen minute or any time they have come in contact with food or beverage employee should avoid touching their face or hair at all time table bar top should be hot wiped in between each customer s use again with hot soapy water and sanitized with a clean towel bathroom assuming they were properly cleaned should be cleaned again every hour including all surface hot wiped and sanitized with a clean towel all surface menu door hardware or area where employee and guest touch should be wiped down and sanitized on an ongoing intra daily schedule avoid handshaking with other employee and guest glove should be worn by all employee producing prepping any food also glove should be worn when sorting or handling silverware if an employee call out sick with flu like symptom they should be required to be cleared by a doctor before returning to work while california law generally restricts an employer from requiring a doctor s note unless the employee ha been absent for more than three day or is without protected state sick leave you also have to balance the ongoing protection of co worker and the guest that could come in contact with the employee given the pandemic indeed just today the los angeles county department of public health issued a local health emergency declaration for the county please discus this with your labor attorney resource to decide what your policy will be but you should certainly get notification out to your employee so they know what to expect if an employee is at the restaurant and is showing sign of illness they should be sent home immediately and can use accrued sick pay for their absence there wa a false rumor regarding a flight attendant that had contracted the coronavirus and eaten at a koreatown restaurant last week needle to say all the restaurant in koreatown were severely affected this past weekend you want to stay out of this situation so please act quickly to protect employee customer and your business

these are different story which is why the post is inhumanly long yesterday i posted a story about a guest clearly abusing our shuttle so it got me thinking of some interaction i ve had with guest taking advantage of the free service we provide for context we provide a shuttle within mile of the hotel available to any registered guest the front desk team take turn doing them when it s not busy enough to have a dedicated driver staffed guest get angry that other guest are allowed to use the shuttle there a lot of major corporate office around u so around pm when everyone s getting off work the shuttle is incredibly busy one night i had different stop to make the first man i picked up got in the van and i told him we had a couple other stop first thing he doe is say no i have dinner plan and need to get back to the hotel i apologized and told him the free service is available to everyone and they all also had reason to need to get back to the hotel he didn t like this answer and said a an elite member he should be treated differently there so many thing i wanted to say like we don t have a dedicated elite member shuttle so he ll have to ride with all the peasant or if he wa really in such a hurry he could have just paid for the short uber ride back to the hotel or he could have charted a private helicopter to get him around the city for all i cared of course i didnt say any of that we didnt talk at all after i told him i had to pick everyone else up first when we finally got back he just threw the door open before i could even get around to open it for him and stormed inside obviously he mentioned in his online review that his elite status ha never been so disrespected entitled douchebag guest get angry that other people are going to the same destination he is similar to the previous one we re near a major sport stadium that hold almost people so needle to say the shuttle is very busy on game day one family came down and asked for the shuttle i told the father traffic wa a disaster and the van wa already out taking another group so the wait time might be upwards of minute he immediately pissed off but doesnt say anything at this point after about minute he come back and say you said itd be minute and it s not back yet i told itd had only been minute he just turned around and went back to his family the van finally come back and a larger crowd had amassed at this point i make sure the man s family is the first one to get on and once everyone else is loaded they re off later i get a call from the same man furious that we didnt drop him off directly at the stadium traffic get really bad so we have to drop them off at a designated hotel drop off that s about a mile walk it could take almost half an hour to get them directly in to the stadium he say i never told him this which i did and that he felt his family shouldnt have had to cram in to a packed van when they asked first i didnt know what to say so once he noticed the conversation wasnt going anywhere he just hung up another entitled douche too cheap to pay for a private ride guest try to use it a her personal chauffeur a woman one night called from the mall about a mile from the hotel and asked if we could come take her to dinner a restaurant a couple mile down the road from the mall further away from the hotel when i tell her service is only to and from the hotel she sigh and say so what are you telling me i need to walk mile to dinner i tell her that it laid out very clearly to them when we drop them off that service is only to and from our hotel so she need to find her own transportation to any other destination then she say well then you can pick me up from the mall drive back to the hotel if you must and then take me right back out to dinner i tell her that s not something i can do because it s clearly an abuse of the free service and tie the shuttle up from other guest who may need it she just sigh again louder this time and say fine just take me back to the hotel if you really want to be this difficult i knew right away what wa going to happen a soon a we got back to the hotel she doesn t even get out of the van and say good now take me to the restaurant i told her that we had already discussed this and i m not able to do that of course she say that she is a guest physically at the property requesting a shuttle to a local business a it meant to be provided she wasn t technically wrong but the way she connived her way to winning wa just really slimy in my opinion it clearly an abuse of the service i reluctantly took her back out then the next day i hear from my coworker that the same woman wanted him to take her to a gas station wait for her to come out then take her to a chinese restaurant wait again and then drop her off at the mall he wa more resilient than i wa so he refused to let her pull the same trick she did the night before so he took her to the chinese restaurant and back to the hotel of course with her complaining the whole way some of you may not understand why it s such a big deal but once we open the door for guest to be able to use it to get from anywhere to anywhere it becomes chaos these are only a few story but this post i already long enough i could write a book on the stupid shuttle and entitled jackass
over the summer i worked a a host at a restaurant that had a pretty high turn over rate their main issue wa people quitting and in my time at the restaurant i only ever heard of one person being fired and boy is that a story so my usual shift at the restaurant were morning shift with the odd evening thrown in there every once in a while this story begin during a particularly slow evening shift very little activity at all in the restaurant due to this i wa standing at the pas talking with my co worker and one of my manager when the phone ring me thank you for calling restaurant name how may i help you fired employee fe is general manager gm there me sorry you just missed him he s gone for the night you can leave a message if you want i think he s in tomorrow morning if it s urgent manager m is here she hang up i didn t think anything of it just someone looking for our gm and wa a little rude about it about an hour later the phone ring again i answer with the same greeting and get the same question fe is gm there me no sorry he s gone home for the night would you like to leave a message fe i called about an hour ago and wa told he d be back now one of my biggest pet peeve a a host i still am at a different restaurant is being called a liar at this particular restaurant i ve had my fair share of customer tell the manager that they had called in and that i had told them something but now they weren t getting it and unless i wasn t sure about something which i specified every time if i wasn t i would never tell someone false information so this kinda peeved me but in the nicest way possible sorta i told her me well actually ma am i wa the one you were speaking to an hour ago and i did say that gm wa gone home for the night i offered you to leave a message a well or you can speak to m if it s urgent she s silent for a moment before saying fine i ll speak to m i hand the phone over to m and go about my night the next day i wa working a morning shift gm wa in but wa helping out in the kitchen a we were short staffed he asked me to take a message for any call for him and he d get back to them when it wasn t so busy the phone ring i answer with the greeting fe is gm there i recognize her voice me he s currently helping out in the kitchen and can t take any call at the moment would you like to leave a message a she had the night before she hung up at this whatever i wa over it i went about my day around the end of my shift a few hour later the phone ring again i answer yet again it s fe fe is gm there me sorry he s busy at the moment can i take a message fe when will he be free me i m not sure he s helping out in the kitchen we re short staffed today it s starting to slow down but i can t give you a definite time a to when he ll be free fe i ll leave my phone number a i m taking down her number she s slightly muffled so i have to ask her to repeat a few time when i read it back to her to make sure i had it right apparently it wa wrong and this bugged her because she literally yelled at me what the number wa i ask her for her name she hang up i go back to the pas and tell the gm he ha a message and explained the situation from today and the night before one of my co worker wa waiting on food and hears co worker she s called like six time today i answered the phone while you were doing room service run and it wa her like four time me she yelled at me for not being able to hear her telling me her phone number and refused to give a name gm that must be fe he explains to u then the whole story fe didn t show up for a few of her shift on the previous schedule no call text or email before or after the fact to explain why she wasn t in didn t answer any call from the manager nothing so they took her remaining shift off the schedule and didn t schedule her for the next rotation this didn t sit well with her so she called the night before the beginning of our shift rotation to ask gm why she had been taken off when i passed the phone to m he explained it to her telling her she wa fired and she actually refused to believe him told him she d only talk to gm about it in total she called the restaurant time in the run of hour because she refused to accept that she wa being held responsible for her action or i guess lack of action and that just baffled me how do you tell a manager that you don t believe what he s saying just because he s not the gm i really wish i knew what happened with the whole situation this wa one of my last few shift before i left and i didn t hear any update before i left i hope they kept her fired but judging by those phone call she probably wasn t going to let that slide

so i work in a schmoliday ex just ex not a amp suite a the fom so background to my hotel and staff we earned the top rank award and missed over a in just our breakfast score all other metric were met or higher we sit in the top in the america we offer extra amenity to our guest and have a waiver from the brand so we don t flunk an audit we aim for award because our management company ha incentive to earn bonus for our high performance my staff kill it our hotel stay like new and most guest we get love u we get a new top shiney member in he book a standard king night stay and check in normally i wa not present at check in a i wa setting up evening reception setting up snack and drink mentioned before extra amenity with waiver i only assume staff followed checkin script like they always do when i go to the desk to confirm inhouse and arrival for reception my staff are speaking to him again he is upset and inform him he would need my approval on something this will be fun because they handle nearly everything in problem resolution except the worst of the worst karen so i ask about what the request is from the guest top shiney member this is somehow super important to have only a quality room and demand a suite upgrade he booked a standard and wa upset he wa given the king standard a he booked because when he walked in we should automatically know to comp upgrade to a two room suite after talking with staff this wa not requested at any point by during check in he wa informed of room type he is upset not only he isn t acknowledged a shiney member with automatic upgrade we offered the amenity option at checkin point or snack and don t you know he always get both everywhere else so he demanded the two room suite from my staff and they were so unhelpful in agreeing with giving him his two room suite our hotel ha no two room suite he argues with year staff because he searched the amp suite and we were top of the local listing for amp suite fact the reason we were top of the list of all the scholiday in the area including full service one is because of our score ranking a a result we are priced higher we sell out more and have higher adr i tell him we have studio suite and list the feature but no two room suite i thought maybe get him in our studio to placate him anyway but he go into how he doesn t want to be at some cheap dirty hotel and room he wanted to book only a amp suite hotel for quality so now i m insulted and mad but somehow smiling he want an amp suite hotel and so in his tantrum call one across town to book a room they of coarse take the reservation for that night and he is believing he is getting a prize going to a amp suite hotel that even giving a price that is le we are top of the local online listing for anything scholiday because we are better end of score while the others sitting at level that my staff would cry or at least i would the hotel he called rank at score and below their bar is set low to attract anything that stop on the highway not because your special shiney he get off the phone and i inform him that we have a hour cancellation policy his room wa in fact type he selected the hotel wa the one he selected there is no fault to the room or his service so we can check him out of the room but he is being charged for the first night of his night reservation he argues this unacceptable i tell him the policy stand and ask if he want to just stay tonight and shorten his stay so the remaining night to stay at the amp suite or cancel it all and i can hand him a receipt for the cancellation before he leaf we go back and forth about his shiney status and is unhappy to hear me say a a shiney member he should understand our policy i affirm that all of any brand hotel have cancellation policy in place where he would fall under fault he think it okay to switch because they are in the same brand i tell him no both property are franchised and owned by different management and reservation are not transferable especially after check in he ended up choosing to stay only one night at our hotel no upgrade and i am not offering it at this point and finishing the other three night in the amp suite across town he wa able to call the other hotel to push back the reservation to next day arrival he go to collect his two free drink at the reception from me he try to push that i really could have waived the policy for him he is shiney stay everywhere with no problem how i wa being greedy and so forth i said policy are enforced on all level to be fair to all guest waiving cancellation fee is not a benefit of any shiney level he then go again how he doesn t want a shady or dirty hotel from lower chain hotel at this i could only smile thinking how much he will enjoy his comp two suite at our lowest ranked scholiday in the city thinking on how much i hope he don t choke on your free drink and free snack that he won t find over there i realize i might sound arrogant about my staff and hotel but the guy wa on that level of insulting and entitled that i can t stand he never stayed with u before but entitlement to max level checked in like he is a top ceo driving over the road on his company credit card acting like a scathing review and complaint to a hotline will make me shake on brand policy we want to win award but leading in fear is not how we do it we have amazing service and treat our guest well our guest review will drown all his noise out he left a review a expected with all s over our policy saying we were nothing special and told it like his entire checkin wa done by me how i didn t acknowledge him wasn t rude but too much about money really wish we could reply honestly to these thing but defensiveness read badly on the hotel no matter how wrong they are happy to say gm responded supporting the policy with no reward point given after all we gave him the room he booked we were the type of hotel he booked and we gave the courtesy of canceling the additional night at no penalty ha wish there wa a hotel support line to complain about this kind of shiney member behavior with an alert to hotel to not tolerate or enable it have complaint line go sir this our policy at this hotel and all of our hotel if another hotel did not follow through on policy properly count that a lucky but do not take that a a standard of service i wish it wa in all brand so that the old i stay at all the time and i have never would be taken for the bold face lie that it is
sorry for formatting i m on mobile and just remembered this sub this happened a couple of year back when i wa working two job a little bit of background i used to work at a family owned pizza and pub joint that wa directly adjacent to a rather corporate and boujee breakfast place a lot of the back of the house staff worked at both the pizza and the breakfast place and i knew them well from being the bartender at the pizza place i wa really cool with most of them because when i would bartend i would always hook up an extra shift drink out of my tip and would always look the other way when the back of the house would bring their own alcohol in our head chef at the pizza place let s call him c wa also the head chef at the breakfast place so c had a little pull around both spot so some personal shit happens and all of a sudden i need to find a second job here s where my relationship with the kitchen is important it wa extremely difficult to get hired at the boujee breakfast place they had almost no turnover and i knew this first hand a some of the server from boujee breakfast would stop by my bar after their shift and get apps and drink for the most part they were pretty cool and i went to high school with one of them anyway i m talking to the server from boujee breakfast and ask if they re hiring a i needed a second job they said they just had a server move away and they got excited at the idea of me working with them the excitement dissipated when the girl i knew from high school let s call her a said yeah but linda boujee breakfast gm doesn t really hire male server and your beard will be a huge issue i say that s ok and figure i ll try and use c a a reference and see what happens can t hurt to apply c get me an interview i shave my beard a part of my soul dy with it and i nail the interview and get the job i m certain i wouldn t have been hired without c s recommendation so you better believe i had a case of beer hidden for him that night at the pizza place now i m working double every day but it really wasn t that bad the boujee breakfast place wa very corporate and that took some adjusting but i wa a professional and it wasn t anything i couldn t handle i make my way through training and quickly adapt to the culture the serving staff there wa all very kind a even the server i didn t know accepted me mostly cause i needed money and would take any shift available this included hosting shift i m not above working any job linda the gm however wa not too fond of me i have a big personality and i like to have fun and linda wa obviously wary of how warmly the front and back of the house warmed up to me linda didn t like me from the start like she wrote me up in my first week for having facial hair when i had shaved that morning and had a little pm shadow i grow a damn good beard but no big deal i started shaving in the back bathroom mid shift to try and keep a good first impression so one day i m covering for one of the hostess now every morning we d have a team meeting where we would review the special with the kitchen and go over any item that may be limited or ed that day our morning meeting go about the day and we re told we have everything my only restaurant experience wa from the pizza place so i had no fuckin clue what a secret shopper wa nor did i really care also no one bothered to tell me that wa a thing had they told me it honestly would not have made any difference but i guess at the boujee breakfast you wanted to get a secret shopper a if you got a on your report the owner gave you a bonus super cool of them so i m hosting and i take a to go order for some dish with steak and egg i send it through just fine the customer pay over the phone le than second later c sends someone from the kitchen up front to let me know that they don t have steak that day and they can substitute another meat or the customer can order something else honest mistake whatever i try calling the customer and it go to voicemail try a couple more time and wa not able to get ahold of him left a message we were super busy and the kitchen is backed up i m still new and very nervous that i m going to get written up again for this so the customer arrives and i told him i m very sorry that we don t have steak and he see that i tried to call him he s very chill and say that s ok can you bring me the same thing with sausage and bacon a wave of relief come over me a double meat price out the same a one premium meat so i can adjust the original ticket to the kitchen without needing a new payment i run to the kitchen to tell c about it and he said it ll be on the fly the customer is so cool about the whole thing that i wanted to do something nice for him so i ask if he d like anything complimentary to drink and he said a cup of coffee would be great so i ring up a cup of coffee and i don t have cash on me hosting that day so i just pay with my credit card yes i paid out of my own pocket for the coffee with my credit card which ha my name on it i rang the coffee up a a split ticket under the customer name obviously i tendered it separately i give him the coffee and say this is on boujee breakfast we really appreciate your understanding and patience customer get his food in record time and he leaf with a smile i had no idea he wa a shopper until i came into work one day and everyone is whispering about me now a come up to me and it go something like this a do you remember when we didn t have steak last week and you took a carry out me yeah i do why what s up a well the customer wa a secret shopper me ok a did you give him a free cup of coffee me yeah a linda read the report and she is pisssssed she s going to call you in her office and you re probably fired for stealing so i start to laugh and a think i m not taking her seriously i let her know that i paid out of pocket for the coffee and she get why i m laughing now linda call me in her office shortly after and make me read the report specifically she make me read the part where the customer indicates that i said the coffee wa on boujee breakfast she asked if i had anything to say for myself and why she shouldn t fire me right then and there i ask linda if she checked the ticket linda make a weird face and asks why she should check the ticket i let her know that i didn t steal anything i paid for the coffee myself and if she pull the ticket she can see my name with the time stamp linda pull the ticket and i ve never seen someone so disappointed that their employee wa telling them the truth she offered no apology and i replied with a shit eating grin she didn t talk to me much after that and i got poached into an office job by a regular shortly after tldr i pay for a coffee out of my own pocket to try and amend a mistake on a to go order customer wa a secret shopper gm accuses me of stealing the coffee i had a receipt that show i paid for it
not a tale and sorry this doesn t fit the light hearted nature of this sub but i wasn t sure where else to post this i m an foh jack of all trade management bar catering occasional serving at a busy local restaurant and bar in southern minnesota over this last weekend i ve become increasingly concerned with how easily coronavirus is spreading and how long the incubation period is and how that affect our job in my case it s college town and the place is also in a hotel heavy area that get a lot of business traveler the more i think about it the more i realize how much common contact i have with people and how much i unconsciously touch my face or hair at work obviously not much but sometimes you just get an itch on your chin or a hair fall in your face etc it s obviously vital that i avoid any contact with this because much like many of you i m sure i don t currently have health insurance or paid time off i have enough stowed away that i can float easily for awhile if i get mildly sick and have to miss a couple week of work and i can afford plenty of preventative stuff but i can t do a hospital stay i close every monday night and it wa slow tonight so i just went wild on sanitizing our common shelf condiment caddy our office s surface commonly used book and manual and bag and all electronic creens and we got a few large bottle of sanitizer to leave by the entrance i figure at the very least the sight of the bottle will encourage people to use them at the end of the day i think most people will certainly be fine but i can t escape this idea that it s our job to amp up hygiene awareness in our building while it s happening better safe than sorry i feel like the midwest isn t taking this really seriously and again it s likely that smaller town like mine might be just fine but there are too many unknown about it for me to rest easy any server here from affected area how have your life changed if at all any fellow midwesterners who are changing their routine preventatively do you think the virus will be an issue in your area
hello all i ve got a small tale regarding a guest who wa just a bit much from the beginning and i wa silly enough to think it would be a calm stay from this guest i have only worked in the hotel industry for a few month and have yet to had someone scream belittle me to my face me me cw crazy wife ch crazy husband amp x b i m having a great day working the front desk having great conversation with coworkers and in walk crazy wife she let me know she is checking in so i do the usual greeting while asking for id and credit card cw well it s already prepaid for so you don t need my credit card it s through fooking com me i will still need to swipe the card for incidental but let s take a look well ma am i see here that it is not prepaid for it wa done through our shmilton website it seems cw so you don t have a room for me immediately get upset and emotional me ma am that is not what i m saying you would have put your credit card on file to hold the reservation and the total amount given to you wa to let you know how much you would pay at the end of the stay unless the website specifically state otherwise cw no i prepaid for it you don t have my room guest then proceeds to walk away get emotional and begin to cry a i can see her wiping her eye constantly thankfully cw s husband come in talk to her talk to me and let me actually explain the situation and how booking a room work he even said we don t get out much no shit sir i couldn t tell but i get them checked in and think that is that amp x b wrong amp x b several hour later ch come down to let me know that cw ha cut her finger on a staple on the couch in her room the couch in our room have pullout bed but there are no staple in the area that she would need to put her hand so i speak with ch offer bandaids and feel the conversation out it didn t seem urgent he didn t ask for anyone to come and look and overall seemed alright minute later ch husband come down again to ask for ointment because the cut is hurting cw i explain that i don t have any and even if i did i can t give it out which is standard with anywhere you go even employer cannot give out medication to their employee almost anywhere so i offer what little help i can and once again he did not ask for anyone to come to the room nor did he make the situation seem like it wa warranted i finish my shift without any other incident have a great night and come in early for my manager who needed to leave check out time roll around and ch come down to check out with me and we start talking ch here is a picture of the deadly staple we were dealing with show me a picture that show staple in a place where they are in any couch and where no hand needed to be me interesting i will let engineering know to take a look later today ch and here is the cut she couldn t go swimming she wa in pain all night and it just ruined her stay i think we may go to urgent care show me a cut on cw s finger that is so small it barely needed a bandied me oh goodness personally i m not sure that is need but if you believe it is need then please certainly go and follow up with u so we can assist ch well some type of compensation would also be helpful me lying through my teeth unfortunately i cannot authorize discount but i can give shmilton point a compensation after discussing how reward point work and the rest of his stay ch went back to his room where i m guessing he relayed our conversation in some strange way to cw because the whole family came down several minute later to finalize their checkout and cw decided unleash all hell below will be various thing that cw said in no particular order because the whole conversation wa so ridiculous cw you ruined my stay i cut my finger on your furniture so i couldn t go swimming or enjoy my night you don t know my medical history and you aren t a medical professional so you can t say anything do you want to take this outside because we can this is all ridiculous i hope you get in trouble for this you ruined my birthday i just wanted a chance to get away from my kid and enjoy my night she had child with her the entire time so i m not sure how this fit in cue several more minute of belittling and screaming at me me ma am i am very sorry you feel that way your husband ha already taken my manager s business card feel free to call or email him regarding the situation have a great day amp x b after the guest left i had my engineer confirm that yes there are staple in the couch a any other couch doe but no where near where she would be putting her hand to pull out the bed amp x b guy this guest blamed me for a terrible stay because she cut her finger i ve cut myself worse while shaving my leg it s so crazy how crazy people can get over the smallest thing a expected she left a terrible review with my name in it several time i wa emotional right after it first happened because that wa the first time i had been yelled at by a guest but otherwise i am reminding myself that she wa over the top and crazy
my shift start it s raining cat and dog and i am assisting two disgruntled guest both just having a bad day and issue checking in but nothing directed towards me or the property i see an older car come into our exit and park right at the front of the entrance our property is small next to a busy street and we only have clearly marked entrance and exit old man man in his s walk in and i let him know i ll be with him shortly he asks what i said and i repeat followed by letting him know that in the mean time i need to ask him to move his vehicle to the temp parking space it s clearly marked and only about car length rearward of vehicle but is not covered his reply well i want to stay out of the rain me i understand but you are parked in the entrance he look at me like i m discriminating against him and storm out skidding off into the street i get a call min later from someone saying they want to cancel their reservation i let him know that he will be charged per our cancellation policy and there s a long awkward silence before this guy is swearing up a storm saying he didn t know about any cancel policy when he called in prior shift forgot to let him know when he booked via phone he also said i he wa the guy who i told to off earlier i put him on hold and confirm the prior shift did forget to let him know i notify the on duty manager and get the okay to waive go back to the phone and he s pulling into ironically the entrance and parking in the temp zone he hang up and is swearing up a storm demanding to speak to the manager about his horrible treatment and that he doesn t like the look of the place manager tell him we will waive the fee time before he finally leaf tldr guest parked in the only entrance zone leaf angry when i ask him to repark in the temp zone cancel based on claiming he wa mistreated never step foot in the room or is on the property longer than minute total
i used to work for a hotel downtown in a sketchy city in canada that is known to have a lot of drug addict it wa just after check out and i had more guest left to check out and i know they didnt leave because they have a cash deposit i called the room to remind them it wa past check out time but they did not answer i waited about min and called again still no answer i go to the room and knock on the door and no answer so i open the door to see if anyone s there nobody s in the room but the bathroom door is closed and the shower is running so i leave because i didnt want to walk in on someone in the shower i wait about minute and call again and no answer i go back to the room and the shower is still running at this point i m very concerned so i open the bathroom door and there s a woman on the floor of the bathtub half naked and unresponsive i start shouting trying to get her to wake up and call i honestly thought she wa dead when i first saw her but i wa instructed by the operator to check if she ha a pulse and to my surprise she doe one of my coworkers is trying to wake her up while i stay on the phone with she finally wake up and get mad at u for being in the room we leave since she half naked tank top on but no pant or underwear but tell her the paramedic are on there way paramedic show up and she refuse to go with them and tell them to leave and is swearing at them and u for bothering her so then i have to tell her she ha to get out of the room it passed check out time and i checked the id of who rented the room and it is not her she say she will leave in min but min go by and she hasn t left i call her and tell her if she doesn t leave i m going to have to call the cop at this point i m done dealing with her so about min later she walk by the front desk eating a bag of chip acting like nothing ever happened and leaf i go to check the room and find she had shit everywhere all over the carpet and had walked in it dragging it around the room and she ha stuffed the pant she shit in under the sink i m wondering how we didnt not notice before it smelled so bad and i just ran out of the room trying not to puke the guy who rented the room never came back for the deposit and the housekeeper found a bunch of drug in the sheet so i m guessing that s why she shit herself and then passed out my boyfriend wa the maintenance man at the time and i still feel bad because he had to do the carpet cleaning in that awful smelling room definitely one of the worst guest i encountered while working there
so we are an extended stay hotel so typically the clientele we have is lot of family or business military guest staying for long period of time because of work so about a year ago this family walked in asking me about what type of room we have and what our rate were if they wanted to stay for two week they explained they were moving down to our city and their house or apartment they didn t specify wa not ready so being that it wa slow i showed the different suite chatted them up and helped them get a good rate they were a super nice couple and they had their three kid with them and i ended up checking them in right then and there they ended up staying with u for a whole month and they were a very happy family and were always together and never caused any problem well their oldest daughter who wa at the time let s call her kate well kate would come down to the desk a lot for her parent and ask for stuff for their room if needed or to buy snack and drink with every visit to my front desk we would chat a lot and she would tell me about her life and what she wa into and she loved to show me her art work which wa super good by the way i felt like kate and i sort of became good friend after awhile so maybe their last week with u kate wa at my desk a usual and for whatever reason she ended up coming out to me and explaining that she is bisexual and she can t tell her family because they are super religious and they have some weird rule which sounded very cult like to me but anyway i wa trying to be a comforting a possible and what possessed me to do this i don t know but i gave her my number and let her know if she ever needed someone to talk to if something happens or if she just needed an outlet to talk about lgbt related stuff that i wa here for her she thanked me and that wa it i wa not there for their check out so unfortunately i couldn t tell kate and their family goodbye i never heard from her so i figured she wa fine or she felt uncomfortable texting a stranger but it wa fine now fast forward to a year later i woke up to two missed call one day from number i don t recognize i saw they left a voicemail and lo and behold it wa kate she basically told me she wasn t sure if i remembered her and she remembered me telling her if something ever happened to give me a call she gave me her email and told me to email her because she had to borrow a random person phone so i immediately emailed her and after a few email back and forth she told me that she came out to her parent and they did not take it well at all and they ended up taking all of her device and decided they were going to marry her off to some guy she doesn t know six month from now and she asked me what she should do the only way she can email me is by using their apartment lobby computer or through some ipod she ha that the parent forgot she even had i gave her some number and website to a few service that would help her including information for our local pride center we ve been emailing more back and forth and she told me she wa going to leave a few day ago and i have not heard from her since i have never been in this situation before and i m such a worry wart i feel like a gay male mother trying to help a smaller gay i normally don t get very personal with guest like this but i felt bad for her and i just wanted to be that person for her because she doesn t have any friend or family to turn to anyway i just wanted to share that with you guy because i ve been so worried about her and just wanted to vent a bit
hey guy coming back to hit you with another rant so i work a little bit outside of downtown a lot of hotel downtown will charge guest an automatic valet fee their parking garage are usually in a underground parking and or a parking fee this is pretty common a most of you may know my hotel ha it own parking garage so we don t charge our guest to park which is fantastic we have a clearance so it fit about most truck and car besides obviously huge over sized one i ve had guest parking on the street and come inside and be like what am i supposed to do i cant stay here if i cant park my car okay how is this my problem if you have an oversize vehicle you should probably call any hotel you are staying at to make sure that your car can fit if that is so important to you you coming in yelling at me isn t suddenly going to make our parking garage smaller also since the parking is free why are you bitching complaining the funny thing is they come in here freaking out and my solution is have you tried parking your vehicle and they are like well no it just look like it wouldn t fit and guess what they pull in and omfg it fit it s like how bout we not come in here throwing a tantrum like a toddler and try it out i feel like i am on one today but i also feel like the guest complaining over literally nothing ha gotten to me i get it it s america and if you want something you gotta yell so you can get that something i don t work like that if someone start yelling at me i instantly want to not help them and instead of trying to find solution or way of compensation i just want to hold my hand up and say i am sorry there is nothing i can do

hello fda a shorter tale today coming from my independently owned room property i arrived for shift just a few minute before pm to find shift checking in an elderly man who is insistent that he need the room to watch the super bowl of course the super bowl isnt today but this isnt a conversation either of u were gonna have with the man shift clock out and i take over the man come back to the lobby and rather aggressively exclaims that his key dont work i apologize and recant the key a our key are known to deactivate frequently he however return and is very upset that i gave him nonfunctional key his room is just next to the office so i walk down with him a he could not give a coherent response a to what exactly wasnt working i reach the door and find that this man is using a business card from some other business a a key i dont know how this wa possible because he handed me his key the first time they didnt work so clearly he knew they were key the real kicker is he wanted a discount because he wa missing the superbowl which a aforementioned is tomorrow tl dr boomer get mad that a random business card doesnt function a a key and that the superbowl isnt on today make it my problem
i work at a steakhouse tip can either be pretty fair or really shitty i had a group of come in and they were a little more difficult than normal which is fine a long a they tip well difficult a in they were pretty demanding i had their drink out in under a minute salad le than minute and entree in about i had all their drink refilled before they were empty and even brought out a free birthday dessert and other server to celebrate the birthday boy i felt like i gave them a great dinner and their bill wa after they paid their bill they stayed for an additional minute which i could ve had another group in and out when they finally left i went to collect the book and tip to find that they wrote in and left an ulta gift card instead whatever a long a the gift card had at least i d be happy i checked the balance when i got home and the card had nothing on it had never even been activated i wa livid the woman that paid the bill probably just grab empty gift card from place to leave in place of a tip trashy human that should not be going out to eat
i work for a not quite a hotel in a coastal city with an airport so many of the local who stay here mostly people who live on the surrounding small island or who live a couple of hour away are doing so before or after catching a flight we see several of them semi regularly it s currently am and i just got a knock on the lobby door from one such regular who had returned from a flight the person picking him up had checked in a couple of hour ago and then gone to pick my regular up from the airport when they came back the key weren t working for their unit the regular came down with his key packet which clearly indicated his room number since it wa late and he wa clearly tired i glanced at his id interrogated the key and only glanced briefly at the screen to note they were programmed for the right room but didn t look much further into it before reprogramming them and sending him back up he d only wanted two of the four key in his check in packet so after he left i interrogated one of the extra key again this time i noted that the room number wa right but the date were from january i looked back into the room history and yup those same folk were in that very same unit on those january date i assume for their flight out coincidental somehow he still had the key packet from the first stay not the key packet we had given them only a couple of hour before we do encourage key return we even have a key drop box in the elevator lobby in the parking level which mean people don t have to stop by the front desk to drop them off but we don t have penalty for key going home with guest we still get guest returning after a year or guest coming from different property handing u their key from the last stay this can be mildly annoying when the key are from a different resort a some of those resort still use the magnetic stripe key while we have been using rfid for quite some time so we end up just disposing of them anyway anyway i think we ve all had those experience with key being demagnetised by cell phone or other card or with the lock being finicky or with the keycard being in rough shape but this is sure the first time i ve had a guest using the old key for the exact same room several week later also the nice thing about regular who stay at my location they re almost always really patient and nice even when their key aren t working in the middle of the night after a long flight gotta love those one
i m working nd shift on a busy night so my expectation for common sense is low but holy shit lady call me asks for my availability for the night asks if she can have the cheapest room i tell her all i have left are basic room at rack rate plus tax she thanks me and said she will be there in minute lady arrives asks what the room look like before she take it i show her some photo she approves all of our basic room have been renovated very recently in pretty much the same way but there might be a few minor difference different type of sink tile etc however in photo they look a bit bigger than they are because of the angle and the wide angle lense we used to take picture but i figure it s the same for every hotel for advertising s sake still it is exactly a advertised min later the lady s husband call me he say the room is nothing like the picture i ask what the problem were he say it s minuscule i sigh and explain that it s the wide angle lens we use and that it s pretty standard for hotel and even apartment and home to use in order to make the room more appealing he say ok and hang up more min later the lady call her voice significantly stressful she asks me why the suite are at a cheaper price than she paid for for a basic room i ask her where she is seeing this and she say it s schmotels dot com i explain that firstly there are no more suite available tonight and i know because i checked them all in secondly the price she s seeing is a non refundable rate for a basic room which is le than the rack rate she argues more and more and finally tell me she s coming to show me what she see sure lady come down and show me i can feel my soul leaving my body a i type this you know how on schmotels they show all of the general picture of all the room and their unbeatable price right underneath without telling you what kind of room the price is for yeah she ha scrolled to very conveniently the picture of a suite and demand to know why it s at discount rate for a basic room plus tx she even click on the reserve button to show me how she ha figured out how to acquire the non existent suite for a big mac wrapper and a dime sigh what is it about hotel that make people lose their mind i just don t get it i ask for her phone and begin to show her look ma am the big picture at the top are just to show you the entire property i scroll to the picture of a basic room then our king suite and say see by your logic i can book this huge room with the top amenity for xx tx that s not right ain t it she still look confused i then scroll down to where you can see the room type and say see there s only the basic room listed because it s the only kind i have available tonight ma am no suite you cannot book a room that doesn t exist she still look confused the husband chime in we have stayed in so manyyyyy hotel everywhere we know how this work yeah sure you do sir i make a show of changing the date to one where we have all room type available and show them see this is what the suite go for i don t know where you re from but you can t just expect a hotel anywhere to offer a suite at xx tax she say well i don t want a suite then i want a suite now ok first of all when you called you asked for the cheapest but sure so i perform my favourite magic trick by changing the date to today and the suite you guess it disappears lol she make peace with this and move on to a to why i made her pay more than what the website offer i begin my usual spiel of we do not own or control otas that the discounted rate is exclusive to the website only and that it non refundable non reversible non modifiable since it s last minute it s cheaper because it come with risk she asks why i can t just give it to her well it s because i m not the ota i m not allowed and my reservation come with le risk your logic where is it i repeat that it s non refundable and she interrupt me of course i don t need a refund i am already here this is not how it work this is not how any of this work she demand i cancel her existing reservation and refund her so she can make another one with schmotels com since they ve only been in there for minute i say sure whatever you want i take care of a few more guest while they sit down to make a new reservation after minute they stand up and say it s fine actually nevermind and go back to their room all that for ten dollar plus tax should ve scrolled to the picture of the parking lot and told them to book that
y all just get those guest that are staying for a week and they are consistently down at the front desk lobby they always have a question a huge favor or a request like how do they keep on coming up with this shit do they ever realize they are driving me crazy over exaggerating but you get the point i think i am only annoyed today because i am working by myself again it ha finally gotten slow enough so i can order food from our restaurant and sit in the back office and eat i swear this lady planned this shit a soon a the server said my food wa ready this guest came and asked me a bunch of question and she wanted to use the printer but our printer on wireless air printing thing wa not working so she demand i call it so we can fix this so guess who s food just sat in the back for min getting cold af me i m writing this out of pure annoyance and hunger so sorry if this come off bitchy or whatever but i feel like y all understand my pain i think the main thing is is that i am working by myself alot and for the most part it not to bad but i literally cannot take a break so i don t get any time to just walk away from the desk and kinda chill out also i guess i would like to add is that i am just venting maybe this isn t the right place but hey here we are
i have wondered if this story would fit here for a while but i think if fit well enough a it is hospitality related back in the mid s i wa a supervisor for a company that managed parking for my state s fairground and expo center part of the responsibility we had wa managing a string of campground attached to the location every year the fairground hosted and still doe host a gigantic horse show that last for week officially but about week with setup we would have around rv s camper and live in horse trailer in the main campground alone and we were filled to capacity in all of the backup space in the fairground proper part of my job wa managing those camping area i would check that people paid take complaint assist people with finding spot and issuing camping permit it wa about week into the show when this all went on it wa about pm and i wa sitting and chatting with a city police officer enforcing a closed street a part of my nightly run through of the massive property fairground take up both side of the street and the road is closed down during major event after a few minute of talking to him i got a call from the show s stall office a guest had a vehicle that wa blocking the hitch to her camper and she needed to leave pretty unusual issue but nothing that i couldn t handle the stall office gave me her space and i asked them to have her meet me there this is where the fun begin i started to leave when my cellphone rang again state police fairground is state property and ha a patrol office with officer on duty called me about the same guest she had flagged down of their patrolling officer and gave them the same story i let them know i wa aware and wa heading to the location at this point i am foot from the officer i had been talking too and had yet to get my golf cart started to head that way when a truck pull up alongside the officer booth it wa the same guest she gave the officer her whole song and dance so i waved her down and told her to head to her spot and i will follow behind at this point i figured she need to get out of here pretty seriously if she is flagging down cop after being told we will help her i finally get to her spot and there is a car slightly blocking in her camper i went ahead with the tow and called a tow truck to move the vehicle a i am getting the offending truck moved the people that own it come over they are a little worried seeing their car being moved but i explain what s going on and let them know that they won t be charged anything for the relocation the woman who needed to leave parked her truck with the front end facing her camper hitch first red flag go inside it and shuts the door realizing something wa up at this point i hung around the campground for about minute before i saw she wasn t intending to leave i went back to my office and started filling out a form so i could stick her with the fee for that entirely unnecessary tow it wa about minute later when i got called again it s the state police the woman had started harassing her neighbor yelling at them and telling them to get out of her space now the rv space are pretty big and during show like this we usually put people into space a there is more than enough room for it i headed up and talked to the guest being harassed while police tried to talk to the crazy guest police got the camper door slammed in their face and they decide not to peruse it after talking to the guest getting harassed the poor harassed guest decided she wa just going to leave a she wa only going to stay for another night and didn t want to be near that psycho a she put it i offered to move her to another space comp this night etc but she just wanted to go home and i didn t blame her i gave the guest a ride back to my office a it wa a bit of a far away got her checked out refunded and went on about my shift that s when the police called me again it had been about an hour since i checked out the guest that wanted to leave making it around midnight when i received this call the crazy guest had gone out to the main power box and unplugged the other camper plugged into the box box per spot and another guest had come in and pulled into the vacated spot i went out to talk to the officer that were already there same one a before and we ended up calling one of the show organizer to come over a well it resulted in a little impromptu conference between me my manager on speaker phone the police supervisor on duty and the show representative we came to a series of decision state police wanted her off the property we and the show agreed my manager decided we would not be refunding her and the show would back u up on that with the way camping worked there for big show we would sell camping a if you intended to stay for the rest of the show and would refund you the unused day when you checked out so that could have cost her anywhere up to if she wa originally planning to leave the next day a for the cherry on top it turn out that the crazy guest wa a member of the horse association that host the show i found out the next day in a follow up meeting with my manager that the horse association decided that her behavior wa unacceptable and she wa removed from the group and banned from any of their event and show tl dr lady get multiple boot for her behavior
guest walk in on xmas eve and asks for the cheapest room upon hearing our rate he say can t you do any better it s christmas after telling him no and that our rate are already set to reflect the holiday and low occupancy he responds with well do you have a manger i said i m sorry but we won t have a manager in until monday i can provide you with their business card if you would like to email them he said no not a manager a manger i ve got a pregnant wife i need to stable i ll admit it made me chuckle a little
some background i work at a small boutique hotel in the heart of downtown in a city parking is a premium and we offer guest one free parking spot either on site in our small car garage or across the street in a larger parking garage not even a minute walk from the hotel this parking is first come first serve we also tend to attract wealthier client even though our price are pretty reasonable i have been working here for month and have become mostly immune to the entitledness some guest feel they have mostly to the story back during my training i wa working one of our busy night one where every room is checking in all in one night thing are going smoothly my coworker and i are shooting the breeze and bonding over tv show probably it s pm and we only have a few more people to check in all of our onsite parking wa taken within the first hour of check in but everyone for the most part ha been understandable and parked across the street with ease we also have too many people left to check in to warrant giving away our temporary parking to those left to check in like we usually do for people coming in super late well my coworker and i notice that this jeep wrangler tear into our parking lot and pull into our one handicap parking spot all of our temporary spot are open and that is where you are supposed to park when checking in and awaiting assigned parking this woman and her daughter get out of the car and they start unpacking my coworker set his jaw and go outside to talk to them i watch on our camera a this lady argues with my coworker and all my coworker can do is use his hospitality voice demeanor they both come in he handle her check in and you can tell that both of them are pissed my coworker later tell me that the woman wa outside insisting that she get to park in handicap because she called ahead and should get a spot on site wasn t moving to temporary and wa fine parking in handicap even though handicap parking wa already assigned for the night and she had no handicap tag we finally got her to move to temp parking i distinctly remember her and what she looked like because i drew a quick caricature sketch of her for my coworker to make him feel better fast forward to now that coworker is one of my best friend he doesn t work here anymore but i still give him update on the shittiest people who come in well on the guest list for this shift i notice that someone had a request of onsite parking if possible my gut reaction now for when someone request onsite parking is to silently hope that we are out for the night because it s first come first serve i don t make the rule but i certainly will follow them well this person walk in and low and behold it s the woman from training i bet i could still recognize her even year from now she immediately make a remark about her having a bigger bag i think to rag on her husband for not carrying all thier luggage himself and a i check her in she tell me that the man who made her reservation gauranteed her parking on site i had to fight to hard to not politely tell her that wa bullshit and i wish that we were busier tonight so i could have made her park somewhere else but ala i couldn t and this second interaction further solidified that entitlment and bitchiness are character trait of hers not a one time happening i texted my coworker about her being back and still being entitled he still remembered her finger crossed she doesn t get pissed becuase we don t have wine or something edit for clarification
i work in a japanese restaurant located in one of the u city where there s been a reported case of the coronavirus while business ha always been slow on weekday ever since news of a confirmed case in my city came out it s been slower than usual yesterday we completely died out save for a few table at pm this is significant because we don t close until pm we open for dinner at pm and close at pm so we were only busy for the first one and a half hour even last weekend wa slower than usual i wa told that on friday they died out at and on saturday night we died out at though part of this wa because it wa lunar new year weekend and so a lot of our asian customer were spending time at home with their family instead of going out to eat even though we are a japanese restaurant it seems many people are still avoiding any asian restaurant in general since the coronavirus outbreak and i ll bet the chinese restaurant next door had slower business than usual too since news of the outbreak
this is happening to me rn and i just have to keep telling myself he must be new but really it s been minute since our apps came out and we still haven t ordered our entree this man about to lose money cause we don t even want to order from him who know maybe i m just feeling a smidge entitled right now update minute update minute now
had lady come in for lunch both older and very sweet with hair done up and s housewife style dress went to drop the check and they started arguing with each other and me about who wanted to pay one of them stand up and put her card in my hand and in the sweetest way and tone possible say i m paying for lunch or i will cut you i laughed took the card and said ok the threat of physical violence win by far one of the funniest check argument i ve ever seen tldr the mom from leave it to beaver sweetly threatened to cut me so she could pay for her friend lunch
edit to add it s been pointed out that those who have service animal are not required to show documentation of it thank you guy for sharing important information like this but i don t need any more comment sharing the same info i ve already brought it up to my manager have a lovely day hi hello i m mostly a reddit lurker but working the front desk in a hotel is bound to leave you with some story to tell sometime last year i had this lady come to check in early no le which meant i wa already just a little peeved with her check in is at pm and it s at pm for a reason but we are rather lax with that rule if the room s ready we ll generally check the guest in regardless of how early they are if it were up to me we d enforce the rule more often than not since advertising to anyone who asks that we allow early check in at no charge make guest come to expect it every time they visit we ve had people at the desk wanting to check in a early a am and get mad that we didn t have their room ready on a saturday morning in the middle of a solidly booked weekend but i digress so this woman is here to check in and oh by the way she brought a dog cool we re pet friendly i just need her to read our pet policy and sign the agreement the usual stuff keep the animal off the furniture have them crated if left in the room alone clean up after them outside etc and it s all fine and dandy until i bring up the pet cleaning fee which is she throw a fit thirty five dollar to have my pound dog in the room that is ridiculous it said nothing about this on online booking site third party reservation tend to be obnoxious a good portion of the time for a variety of reason including spam booking with invalid credit card that end up being no show that we can t charge and another reason that i ll explain in a minute firstly our listing on third party booking site actually do clearly state that we are pet friendly and there will be a fee applied of course the exception to that rule would be a registered service animal by law and we have to be shown their paper at check in she asks me to waive the fee so i apologize for the miscommunication and explain to her our policy tell her i can take cash or add it to the bill being charged to her card she think for a minute well he s an emotional support animal i believe this exactly but i play along and ask to see the paper anyway she say she doesn t have the paper on her i smile and explain our policy to her again this time highlighting what i mentioned above that guest bringing in service animal will not be charged the fee but only if we are shown paper at check in finally she back down on that but is not happy about it i add the to her bill she go to her room with her dog and i have hope for only about a half hour that i won t have to deal with her anymore she come back out and start looking at our for sale item we have a small gift shop located directly next to the front desk which is really just a little nook with some glass shelf stacked with knick knack canvas painting and various decor the lobby is filled with such decor some of which is price tagged guest usually get a kick out of going around to look at everything and seeing that much of what is displayed is also for sale even if they don t buy anything this lady look at everything that s for sale pick stuff up and say that s cute and then look at the price tag turn to me and say this is not worth insert here to be fair some of the stuff is overpriced but most of it is pretty on par with what you d spend on the same stuff at any other primitive style shop this is the least irritating thing she did during her stay but i just thought it wa kind of rude anyway it roll around to a day or two later can t remember how long she stayed but i wa also on shift when this woman came to check out where i work the whole charging process go like this when guest reserve we take the card information to hold the room and be able to charge them if they no show we hold the fund at check in and then we charge them when they check out so i go through my usual check out spiel which is mostly just asking how their stay wa confirming that the card on file is the one they want to pay with guest often decide to split payment between two card or pay half in cash and don t say so at check in and ask them if they want a receipt so i m like and this is going on the card you gave me at check in correct and she stop me and asks what the total is going to be she act surprised even though part of my check in speech is pointing out the total for their stay including tax on the reg card that they sign before i give them their key and it wa the same total i d shown her before with the added like i told her it would be and say she should have gotten a discount because she booked through a third party which technically she did but only of a few dollar so i tell her that she did in fact receive a small discount she still doesn t like it demand a bigger discount now we come back around to one of the other reason why third party reservation are obnoxious we can t alter the rate for third party reservation since when reservation are made through their site they are entitled to a percentage of the payment we receive from that guest basically if we lower the rate for a guest who booked through a site like that we lose money we have plenty of guest ask about a senior discount and stuff like that at check in or check out when they booked through a third party but most of the time when we explain that we can t alter their rate they accept it and move on not this lady well this rate is ridiculous and blah blah blah lady you knew the rate when you booked and even if you didn t i reiterated it for you at check in not only am i not supposed to change the rate for reservation like these i literally can t change them in the computer system i tell her this she argues with me for five minute all the while i just keep repeating the policy back to her she pull the my husband wa in the military so i should get the government rate which again not how it work i have to see government id to give out the government rate which she obviously doesn t have she argues with me for five more minute eventually one of my coworkers who mostly work breakfast but sometimes work shift at the desk come out and tell me to just give the woman a discount and refund her in cash which i am absolutely loathe to do and wouldn t have done if the guest hadn t already heard her say it so i refund her cash and send her on her way smug and stealing from u and then after the last of my departure for the day have checked out i go to open the door to dirty room so i can take out the trash and strip the bed for housekeeping and this woman ha made such a mess bag taken out of the garbage can a full can of soda spilled in one of them along with some unidentifiable sludge popcorn ground into the carpet stained sheet looking back on it i wish i d charged her a cleaning fee i wa still new at the time and wa nervous to do thing like that and honestly a big part of me just didn t want to hear from her again and we certainly would have if we charged her card again instead i passed the info along to my manager who i don t believe charged her either since the room had already been cleaned and she s not fond of charging people herself these day my spine is shinier and should she ever return she s got another thing coming
so my previous shift wa great it wa at the end of my shift however where i encountered my worst enemy the business center printer i am skilled in computer skill but printer are an untamed beast in this wild wild world they have been and shall always remain enigmatic being of control being that can make or break my shift and also my faith in my intelligence what happened well it started out with a lady needing to print off some report it s in the early morning so when the computer say printer is offline she come to me when i hear that this issue is with the printer i abandon all hope but march onwards at least i can try i try everything i can it get to the point where the lady try to help me help her we both fail and acknowledge that our combined knowledge stats are too low for this god tier creation hand picked by satanael himself we both decide to wait for the manager to come minute later the manager arrives and i tell him the issue and he clock in and set off for the business center i follow to try and see where i had gone wrong in my life not one fucking second passed and he had already deduced the problem what wa the problem the fucking usb cable wasn t plugged in two grown as adult were outsmarted by a fucking cord not being plugged in i had never felt such burning shame in my life and that s how me and a guest were destroyed by a printer subsequently proving what we all knew if breathing wasn t automatically regulated by my body i m sure i would have died long long ago edit it connects through a usb port not hdmi further proving how hopeless i am lmao changed that real quick
for me it wa one from a cafe that i interviewed at it wa extremely snooty and i didn t get it but the question wa if you were to steal anything in here what would it be
im not allowed to say too much but i posted here a little bit ago about me leaving my server book and money getting stolen yall my manager did something about it he put up camera and we caught the kitchen guy stealing from the drawer cant prove that is who stole from me or other circumstance but it assumed now and taking a closer look into thing they were actually clocking people in that were never there that day it go so much further most of the kitchen wa fired on the spot a few that got called by the fired kitchen claiming some other bullshit so they never came back we were left with the one guy that wa on vacation during all of this he wa immediately place to lead we know he had nothing to do with it and the bos hired a new co lead that happened to be a guy the og kitchen guy knew for many year before hand and he is used to fine dining compared our simple pub food he had come in ready to work and excited we worked our bar with no kitchen for a few day and not only ha he learned our menu in two day he ha significantly improved our food we hired two more today again ready to work and care the difference in everyones attitude is night and day the storm had finally ended and there are only rainbow looking forward
still seething about this one guest came in and asked me to check the lost in found came back empty handed for some reason the question he asked me wa if i m legally blind i am but i don t know how he figured that out anyway he decides he want someone else to check the lost in found now a if a big blue coat is hard to see pissed me off that he had to bring my disability into this
last night we were sold out and had almost check in which is insane for our sized property it wa the most i ve ever seen in my year working here anyway it had been ridiculously busy non stop i had a line of people that i wa trying to tear through a fast a possible a woman who had been standing in line for like minute get up to the counter i ask her for her name and nothing come up i tell her this and she just roll her eye she say well check again because i know i have a room here i tell her i need a confirmation number after another round of eye rolling she pull out her phone to look for it thankfully she wa able to find the confirmation number right away we all know how frustrating it is to wait around while a guest dig through their phone for minute looking for it i put the number in and of course she s supposed to be at a different hotel a couple mile down the road also the exact same brand a my property obviously that wasnt going to be the end of our conversation the first thing she said after that wa then move my reservation here i honestly cant believe you re being this difficult if you had bothered to check you d know i m an elite member i m super annoyed at this point i tell her we re sold out so i cant offer her a room here she then say but i do have a reservation you just refuse to honor it she just couldn t understand that just because she had a reservation with a brand that doesnt mean she can stay at literally any property under that brand using the same reservation number and of course she mention her elite status like that s supposed to make a room magically appear after she went off about that i had no idea what to say i finally just say ma am there nothing i can do for you i m going to have to ask you to step aside so i can assist the guest who actually have reservation with u she give me one of the bitchiest look i ve ever received and say wow well you have just been so much help very condescendingly and sarcastically she just storm out the door
what a not too long but very strange and horrifying trip it ha been i am no longer at the property and no longer have to deal with the new manager from hell here is the last sad part of the tale cast j new manager m pet minion hired by manager h former fd employee after the new schedule went up wa texted to everyone and i saw what j had done i just knew my day were numbered it wa only a question of if i would be fired or if i would quit the new schedule went out on wednesday i had thursday off and j worked her entire shift friday i worked but j went home sick early so i didn t see her saturday and sunday i had off but j managed to come in both those day come monday j finally wa there when i worked she didn t say shit to me about the schedule i kept up the nice friendly attitude now h had put in her notice and her last day wa thursday i came in to give her a coffee and to say goodbye apparently m who wa also there made the comment that she wa so upset about how thing worked out and that she didn t know what to say to me i just texted h back that it wa m s problem and not mine i wasn t going to start anything if she didn t h also texted me that j wa going to have a talk with me next time i came in she also told me that i shouldn t be worried about being fired because j wa hoping that losing my day and hour would hurt me more than being fired that pretty much solidified my thought on quitting i refuse to work for a manager that deliberately go out of their way to hurt their employee and then brag about it to other fd people that is not a manager in my opinion so we come to tuesday i wa still on the fence of what to do happened to run into my old manager at another store i saw her and just lost it i hugged her and just cried on her shoulder for about minute seeing her and remembering how fun the job had been made the decision for me i wa quitting that day i wa scheduled to pm with another fd person that night i came in at with my written notice of resignation effective immediately i didn t plan on making a scene i wanted to turn it in and just leave i get there put the paper on j s desk and tell the morning person that a will be there in a bit and that i m not staying the morning person then tell me that j had given the other girl the night off without telling me and that i had to stay i just said nope i don t texted j about my letter and left finally got a text about minute later from j telling me that it s for the best damn right it is couple of aside comment i had planned originally to talk to the owner but they are in the process of selling their property and don t really care about anything else they want the money and to get out going to them really wasn t an option a for the gm directly above j she wa hand picked by him and think she is sooooooo wonderful so also not an option there are various theory on what she did to make him think she is so wonderful also my former manager ha ton of contact after being in the business for year and she made sure to tell everyone the entire story of what went down right now j s reputation is in the toilet because of this

hi i m new to the hotel business started in september so anyway it s me one other front desk agent and one of the head of housekeeping at the front desk this guest come down asking for like towel we re a smaller hotel so we usually only have towel in the office so both the housekeeper and the other agent went to housekeeping to get the guest their towel that is when the guest start saying so if i would ve booked a different room and checked out of my room and checked into a new room i d have a clean room by now me i m sorry can you repeat that guest my room wasn t clean i except a clean room did the housekeeper leave already me i m sorry to hear that but no they re still here they re here til about pm what room are you in guest well i wa out all day and it s already pm note it wa and my room isn t cleaned me i m sorry what room are you in guest would it be cheaper if i just booked a new room me no i m sorry i m not sure i understand what you re asking guest would it be cheaper if you gave me a new room me no but i can discount your rate for your room not being cleaned if you would like guest no i don t want anything my coworkers come back with his towel and offer to take them up for him and he say no about an hour later we get a call from our reward system asking about the guest and what we did like how are you going to deny everything i offered and then go and tell on u plus i never got their name or room number
i work at a very small historic boutique inn this week someone hung himself in one of our room i m so happy i wasn t working when he wa found but i feel so strange now when i walked past that room and the room is back up for sale now i m surprised that it happened in our inn because you hear about these thing happening in motel usually just shaken up about it recently
two chinese mainland guest come in they say chinese so i call my interpreter colleague over and stand on the side she show a picture on her phone it s a picture of the roof of the veranda of the floor below and there s a hole the size of a basketball in it i wa like how the hell did this happen and said they will be billed for the damage it wa in the morning so it s not a drunk stupid thing because the room below would ve called to report the sound of the roof breaking open and the debris in their veranda i just wanted to post this here because they were both sane people not drunk and they decided to throw their ceramic elephant shaped soap dispenser out of their balcony how do people decide to do this simply what the fuck
two hour before close last night we had a group of walk in for a table slightly annoying but the host found a couple table to clean off for them and seated them while their server wa getting their drink a large group of people came in and said they were joining the top their group then became and we had to clean off more table to put together for them their server started getting more drink order while some of the people who got there first loudly complained about how long the service wa taking the server frantically put in their food order lot of steak and large dish that take a while to cook while the rest of u helped take care of his other table and our own while he wa putting in food another group of people walked in to join the big group putting them at a grand total of we had to clean off more table which wa hindered by a couple of the joiner grabbing the table and pulling them away from u while we were trying to clean them people started complaining they didn t have drink yet while our one bartender wa doing her best pumping out big flavored margarita and preparing their multiple drink tower another server jumped behind the bar to help while the rest of u ran the drink a they came out since we were nearing the end of the night when they ordered their food the kitchen and our two chef were in no way prepared most of the prepped food and veggie had been gone through and the dishwasher had to step into overdrive to clean enough plate for all that food the chef got the food out a quick a they could and all the server ran dish a soon a they hit the counter getting the right meal out wa a challenge because all the people apparently immediately forgot what they ordered and would just stare at me when i loudly called out whatever meal i had within all the chaos the chef had forgotten to make a few meal by this point most of the people who were eating were already done and ready to leave a few people started swarming the server at the computer demanding comped drink and free food on top of their military discount for having to wait so long because it s definitely our fault you walked in with a group of over people and apparently don t have a concept of how long food take to cook people sitting at the table were loudly complaining about all of u and the restaurant itself and were threatening to leave bad review then the kicker they all wanted separate bill our computer cannot even separate that many bill at once so all of u were telling their server to just give them one bill and let them know that restaurant policy doesn t let u split that many bill however since they were complaining so much and a few people kept mentioning that they re all active military member the server did his best to split the bill and put the drink and food where he could he tried asking his table for help but clearly some people lied to him and he ended up with over worth of unclaimed food and drink after everyone had paid the food wa comped but he had to pay out over for the drink that people had and nobody paid for some people tipped him nicely and others not at all and they left large mess of chip and salsa and cheese all over the table incredibly while that top threw the restaurant and server into chaos the rest of the table we had were all amazingly patient and understanding my last table had to wait almost an hour for their food to come out and i didn t hear a single complaint from them i am very very thankful that at least the other table recognized that the problem wa the large table and didn t also try getting free stuff because they had to wait now the goal is to convince the bos to not allow big group to walk in without a warning like that and to forbid a group of over people to pay separately tldr a group of walked in for a table and multiplied to become people they complained about how long it took one person to make drink how long it took two people to cook meal how long it took three people to run out plate and plate of food at a time then demanded free meal and drink to make up for the problem that they themselves caused
for almost eight year i worked at a popular u s chain restaurant that specializes in breakfast food i won t go into specific but they may or may not heavily feature various flavor of pancake over time several manager came and went but the one who stuck around wa the ladder climbing brown nosing gm a narcissistic verbally abusive control freak mommie dearest knock off she had a way of making please and thank you sound like fuck you among her countless annoying attribute included breathing slandering others to guest and staff alike she while delivering an instruction order wouldn t allow me to respond then conclude the interaction with mmmkay mmmkay which wa almost always followed by an annoying crypt keeper cackle funny story one christmas i wa unlucky enough to draw her name for the secret santa gift exchange i seriously considered buying her a batch of wire hanger with the card simply saying no wire hanger ever i wa one of those highly valued employee but the way i wa treated completely belied the compliment and accolade i received i e my schedule being flipped without my consent day off request being denied while new employee and the gm s drinking buddy got preferential treatment always taking the side of the guest when they were angling for a free meal etc perhaps the worst wa the bullying and pettiness among certain employee it wa like high school for example another employee poked me in the face with a tampon right in front of both manager i filed an official complaint and nothing came of it this is one such occasion where they couldn t claim ignorance my complaint made it real and they had to address it address it they did they saw me a a whistle blower management couldn t have cared le about staff morale it wa typical of both of those embittered hag to accept hearsay a fact they rarely did their diligence in getting both side before plotting a course of action oh and plot they did most of the time they would take the word of the so called customer or the server passing on the complaint the complaint itself of course wa completely fabricated no such customer existed and it wa really a coworker just trying to stir the pot unfortunately the following show they responded to my complaint to workplace bullying with malicious intent this whole shit show came to a head when a cokehead now former employee circulated a rumor that i refused to wait on this elderly african american military veteran because i wa a racist being one myself i respect all veteran i found it alarmingly laughable at best because i am a very gay man and most of my boyfriend haven t been white hell everyone including management met my brazilian then boyfriend when he had previously popped in for sunday brunch so you can understand why this accusation wa out of character and completely out of the blue it reeked of sabotage it wa too outlandish to be anything else so the write up came i wa absolutely furious a my suspicion that i wa being setup had been confirmed both the narcissistic gm and the drunken assistant manager would not let me get a word in i finally got their attention by stating in a raised voice that i had a right to have my say surprised at my assertiveness they went slit eyed and rather smugly said go on i pointed out to them that all of my guest love me several of my regular are hispanic or african american and in nearly eight year of employment never once had i been accused of being prejudiced or bigoted i also pointed out that one of my regular a married female african american doctor if my hand were free would run up to me give me a big hug kiss me on the cheek and hold me so tight i felt like i wa being suffocated my manager were having none of it i also pointed out that the shit starting liar who filed the complaint against me had been fired because she wa caught by the gm snorting cocaine in the lady room given her predisposition to lie the validity of her accusation should be questioned and the write up destroyed based off of their surprised expression it wa clear i had exposed their complicitness in creating a hostile work environment but they refused to take the bait completely done with their fuckery i flat out bellowed i am not nor have i ever been a racist i m pretty sure the entire store heard me then i went for the zinger that lingers you have no idea how much black dick ha been in me you could have heard a pin drop the creole prep cook wa walking by the office door when i let out that line and she nearly doubled over with laughter there were two training manager facing away from u while they were on the computer doing online course they almost collapsed onto the keyboard then turned around looking at me with shocked expression on their face the assistant manager s face went beet red the gm s face turned white and her eye widened i didn t give them a chance to respond i said you know what i took off my key fob laid it on the safe emptied my apron put everything in a togo bag did an about face and walked out it wa exhilarating and liberating all at the same time it wa like the end of private benjamin when goldie hawn walked out of her wedding and threw away her veil except i ve never worn a dress just kidding yes i have aside from returning two week later to get my final paycheck i haven t set foot in there i have no reason to back i have a new job at a wonderful company with great boss that value me a an employee and a a person i actually look forward to going to work now i never thought that wa possible double plus they don t expect me to be an emotionless robot edit for those of you commenting sending me message declaring that i could still be a racist or that my attraction to ethnic men is just a fetish kindly fuck in the direction of off save your race card pulling unintelligible psychobabble for someone without a brain

i started last week and everyone is really nice and welcoming except these two server i m a hostess and a busser but mainly host it s funny they re mother and daughter too lol but they never said hi to me nor smile it s like they act like i don t exist and i seriously dislike having to tip either one of them out because they just stare with this face that look annoyed because i m not a fast or learning it s my th day and i m getting used to the top out i m great with the register it s just tipping out a i wasn t taught it did it without anyone training when they see my coworker they smile and say hi but when they come near me they go blank i had to once ask the mom a question about juice and she answered back in an annoyed tone i know how she talk regularly because she sometimes come to the counter and talk with my coworker i m starting to think it s cause i didn t introduce myself nor say hi but idk i m really shy and quiet but i do small talk and thankfully my coworkers are outgoing so it make me engage in more convos
thank you for being so polite thank you for being so friendly to me even a i wa running around my section and i forgot your refill special thank you to your young daughter who wrote me a thank you note you all made my shift awesome today
our hotel provides a shuttle to nearby business the three front desk agent take turn doing them until it stop running at a couple night ago someone came up and asked me if he could use the shuttle i tell him yes but i needed an address first to make sure his destination is within range he say it s a hotel by the stadium but he doesn t know which one i tell him i can t take him over there without an address because there s over hotel within mile of here so it could be any one of those he s clearly frustrated that i m pestering him for an address he keep insisting that i just take him to the one closest to the stadium which i tell him could be one of or different hotel he finally get the name of the hotel from his friend just the name not the address to which i tell him there s two of those within a couple mile of here so i still need an address he then go off about how difficult i m being and if i didn t want to take him so bad i should just pay for his cab so i finally get annoyed and agree to take him to the closest frampton inn in to the stadium he just scoff and follows me outside i drop him off and not minute later i get a call from him he s immediately screaming about how i dropped him off at the wrong hotel that i should know the area better he wa demanding that i come back to the wrong hotel and take him to the right one funniest part is he finally called his friend and got the address the right hotel isn t even at the stadium it s a quarter mile from it it wa very satisfying to tell him that service is only to and from the hotel so if he needed to go anywhere else he would have to make other arrangement of course he tried to say it wa my fault so i needed to provide the shuttle to compensate for my mistake i just told him that i took him exactly where he asked and a i wasn t provided an address i couldn t have known the correct location he just slammed the phone and i never heard from him again disclaimer i know from a customer service perspective i didn t handle this appropriately i probably should ve just gone back to get him which really is against the rule but had i ran it by management they probably would ve been ok with the exception but we re all human and can only tolerate so much arrogance and condescension for so long
so ride sharing apps came into my area a few year ago which caused most people to switch over to them rather than using the preexisting taxi company this caused all but one of the taxi company to go out of business and the one that is left is notoriously unreliable the problem is that most of the ride sharing driver only work during peak hour namely hour where business or bar are open if you need a ride in the early hour of the morning there s no longer any option available to you around here this is a problem because the local airport just expanded it hour to allow earlier flight so we have a bunch of guest showing up at the desk at am in the morning in a total panic about not having a ride to get to their am flight my hotel ha a shuttle but the shuttle driver are still scheduled around the previous airport hour and our owner ha proved unwilling to approve extra hour to their schedule it just been a mess from every angle
i m sure this ha been asked before but i cannot seem to find the right combination of word to find your story of pettiness and spite i ve been serving for nearly a decade and it seems that there s always at least one regular who come in want special treatment and never ever tip sometimes this person is perfectly pleasant and you almost feel bad for resenting them sometimes it s a family that wreaks havoc on the dining room week after week sometimes it s an overconfident white male who force you to laugh at his bad joke and then wink at you when he writes a large zero on the tip line i lie awake at night dreaming up way to tell these people that whenever they walk in the door the staff collectively roll their eye that despite the fact that we continue to treat them like the vip that they think they are we have a voodoo doll of them in the back room i ve never quite summoned the courage to say anything to any of them i m always stopped by the possibility that they ll take it out on the establishment shout from the rooftop yelp that the restaurant must be destroyed and i ve always worked for people i cannot do that to have always been unwilling to make trouble for management over a likely tip so please let me live vicariously through you tell me about the time you told one of these cheap bastard that they re doing it all wrong
my recently mom got diagnosed with cancer and started chemo the first day she started chemo i had the dinner shift i had sat with her a long a i could before leaving for work and wa upset but decided to hold my head high i work a sushi hibachi place where people can sit at the sushi bar and when that happens i really only have to worry about getting drink and taking their order putting in the order to the system the sushi chef will hand them their meal old man and woman sit down semi regular i went up three time in min initially to get drink and then twice to see if they were ready to order the third time the old man said in a truly venomous way how about i just whistle for you like a dog when i want something and turned away smirking i wa stunned and hurt more so given the situation of the day i walked it off deciding a i turned away that i d just ignore them for the rest of their stay it made me realize how true the statement is that you never know what somebody is going through and i m trying to keep that in mind going foreword old man fuck you though i wa trying to do my job

i work in a small cafe that s part of an alcohol distilling tourist attraction so walking tour go through a functioning distillery etc it wa just myself female and a female colleague that afternoon working we haven t had a customer walk in to the cafe in about minute there are obly two other customer sort it at table sipping away at coffee colleague and i are beside the till chatting about her finding a new apartment since she s moving this older man walk up to the till and i smile at him etc say hi ask how he is he laugh and say sorry to interrupt your very high powered meeting seemed important i laugh awkwardly and ask him for his order he s hmming and hawing when his friend arrives and they both keep changing their mind etc about whether they want tea or coffee hot food or pastry i m getting a little irritated because jesus just make up your mind but sure whatever finally they decide and the initial man offer to pay for everything with his card i start ringing him through and ask if he d like his receipt he laugh and say no i m fine and i think that s that until his mate start going on joking about terrible accountant the fist man swears at him laughing and his mate responds with don t talk like that in front of the little girl you ll traumatised her and they both chortled now i m small i m and rather slight i also look quite young when i m not wearing makeup but i m i m at work i m hardly a little girl my colleague is also like so she wa getting pissed too finally they saunter off to their seat and i bring them their tea and coffee and their sandwich and they start joking again about how theyre fighting call me a good girl a i just nod curtly and walk off one bad customer of what wa a day full of them
i work at a mexican american food place that s between a fast food and a sit in i m so used to people being completely indifferent to the fact that i too am a human and not just a robot that you give command to like a real life siri not everyone is necessarily rude per se that s a different story for another day but most don t talk to me like a normal person it s just subtler thing that make me feel le valued while in uniform just for being a food server i greet people they ignore me okay people order and never even make eye contact people don t say please nor thank you people leave their cash card receipt etc on the counter for me to grab instead of handing it to me sometimes even when i literally have my hand stretched out some people don t even make coherent sentence it s just fragment i have people walk up to my register and say nothing but fish burrito or whatever item they re purchasing or nothing but their name if they re picking up a phone order that s it no hello no please no thank you nothing i don t mean to sound entitled i m not demanding anything nor salty it doesn t piss me off if i did i d always be angry at work there just seems to be a disconnection from our humanhood and the way customer see u like we re a blank slate that punch in their order delivers food to their table and fill up the napkin when they re running low nothing more when we have those customer that make u feel like we re a much of a person a they are it really make our day and we genuinely want to go out of our way to make their stay a enjoyable a possible it seems so simple yet when those who genuinely talk to u and look at u like we are just another being a complex a any other and treat u a such they really do leave a huge impact on u we ll give them discount free drink free item we remember them and are much more likely to do thing for them we don t do for anybody else we ll cater to their need and want above average customer service where we work our average customer service is still pretty hecking good it s kind of a bittersweet situation because we love those customer but it s also kind of sad how craved we are for basic polite human interaction that we get so excited when it doe happen it s not about being overly friendly talkative outgoing it s about having a basic sense of curtesy towards those around you even those meant to serve you working customer service is rarely a nightmare for me fortunately but all too often slightly dehumanizing we re people too just like you please treat u a such

tl dr at the bottom just so everyone know before reading this this is not a a full on story but more of a rant i m not sure if this is really allowed here so if there is a more specific sub for this let me know but mainly i m posting this just to blow off some steam i ll do my best to not make this crazy long so sit back and listen to my woe is me rant or don t i m not your mother a little over a year ago i graduated college and moved a couple state away for personal reason and wa in need of a job quickly i found a hotel that wa looking for people wa able to a get an interview the same day i filled out an application and that is where i am to this day throughout the time i have been here i have experienced cheap ownership that could be a post of it own illegal business transaction shaving of overtime hour gm change our sale director quitting piss poor maintenance both the upkeep of the hotel and our actual maintenance person lazy housekeeper everyone that worked here when i started leaving and everyone that replaced those people leaving a well except for one person and that is where this rant truly begin about month ago the gm that hired me wa fired and honestly i wa pretty happy about this the dude wa a total as and would tell you to something one way and get pissed when you didn t do it the other way but i digress ownership brought in a new gm on the spot from one of his other property and she wa pretty cool she took no bullshit from anyone and it actually seemed like we were going to have a gm that had a backbone notice that i am using past tense here because my first impression wa dead wrong when this gm came over from another property she brought someone with her to fill up another front desk position and for the sake of this post let call this guy richard richard is a total dick from when richard first started working to now i have seen all the og crew slowly start to leave but good ole dicky boy ha stayed and this guy is piece of work he is always late assigns people to incorrect room ha piss poor customer service nothing is ever his fault ha a shitty work ethic and now he is on a major power trip i could go on and on about it but this post would get lengthy quick fast and in a hurry there were multiple time where i really wanted to quit on the spot and that be the end of it but unfortunately paying bill is a thing so i couldn t quit until i found a new job i didn t look too hard because i found out that my front office manager at the time wa leaving at the beginning of the new year and i wa told by multiple source the gm being one of them that i wa going to take over a fom i wa happy with this so i toughed it out for a couple more month went on vacation for two week to visit family over christmas and new year and when i came back to work i would be promoted at least that s what i thought while i wa gone the sale director quit on the spot for ownership pushing her over the edge and the front office manager quite a week before they were actually suppose to leave also because of ownership i got all this information on new year eve in text format at at night while i wa piss drunk i wa a little stressed the next couple of day preparing myself to go back to work and deal with all the chaos that happened while i wa gone oh also during this time while i wa away the hotel hired someone and then fired them soon after they were hired so we still needed some spot to fill so i come back from vacation feeling recharged and ready for the new year in the past i worked night audit and afternoon shift but now my schedule wa strictly morning since our fom wa gone i wake up bright and early get to work on time meet the new night audit hire and waited for my gm to come in but she never showed instead i get a text from her saying that she will be working at another property her original property she wa at because that gm over there quit and ownership want her to work both property now what the fuck so i strap myself in for a stressful couple of week and get to work my gm told me that i need to post hiring ad online make the schedule train the new hire she made when i wa gone and pretty much do sale yeah we still don t have a sale director and she pretty much said that i am running the show now to me that sound like i am officially the new fom right wrong oh so so so wrong i know i said this rant begin with richard and this is where shit really hit the fan so here we go for a couple week thing were going well i wa getting into the groove of thing and training up the new hire that i hired of course had to confirm with the gm before hiring anyone life wa good until one night while i m home enjoying the evening i get a text from good ole richard saying that he made the schedule for the next week well this isn t good since i have already made the schedule for the month that way everyone know that they are working and can plan accordingly i don t respond and leave to talk to my gm in the morning i come in the next day and ask her if she can come by the property real quick so i could speak with her about some thing she show up and we sit down and talk it out i told her about richard s text he sent me and i straight up ask her if i am the new fom since i haven t been specifically told but with the task she ha given me it wa very much implied this is how the conversation went down gm there is no front office manager i am having you do thing to help me and i am having richard do thing to help me me okay well then who is suppose to make the schedule then since there is no manager you had asked me to do it so thought it wa my duty to make it gm you and richard need to figure that out yourselves i don t have time to deal with drama between you two me okay well then what is my role here since i am doing manager duty and sale gm you are just helping me out that s all and that wa pretty much the end of the conversation i got no real answer and nothing ha been resolved i forgot to mention that since this gm started working here she ha talked mad shit about richard saying that he is unreliable is clueless most of the time never on time and asshole and that she need to get rid of him so why the fuck is he not gone yet anyways i work the rest of my shift and wait for richard to come in so we can hash this scheduling thing out he show up late a usual and i sit down with him to talk this out me alright so thing haven t been communicated well between u about what our role are so let hash this out like adult gm had asked me to make the schedule the past couple of week so i wa under the impression it wa my job to do so moving forward is that going to be a problem richard yeah i want to make the schedule because you have not given me a weekend off and you are trying to screw me over first off i am doing a trickle down schedule where everyone get equal amount of weekend off that way no one is pissed that they worked most weekend while someone else hasn t worked any it worked really well at the job i wa at before the hotel so i imputed it here if he looked ahead another week he would have seen he would have weekend off and i would be working weekend i tried explaining this to richard but his small peanut brain couldn t comprehend it me fine how bout this we both work on the schedule together you make a mock schedule and i make one and we sit down and work together to get it sorted out deal but for the next week the schedule ha already been made and approved by everyone working so we are going to go with that one for now since it is already out sound good richard fine and that wa that i left for home and enjoyed my day i thought all wa solved and there would be no drama in the work place everything wa good until last night i get a text from richard saying that the schedule that wa put up wa not the one he made again i explained to him that we agreed on working together on the schedule and also the one that wa already up wa staying and he agreed to it of course knucklehead fought back and wa being a full blown richard to the point where i just said fuck it if you want to make the schedule then go right ahead this is isn t worth fighting over then i call my gm and fill her in on thing letting her know that i tried to reason with richard and nothing seems to work and he ha gone power hungry i told her that she need to give u both defined role and non of this work it out together crap because i ve tired that and it hasn t worked yet then she go and tell me she doesn t have time for this drama and to say it with me folk figure it out yourselves i realize that i am not going to get the answer i want and thing are just going to keep getting worse i should have left a long time ago there is no communication between anyone here no room for growth ownership suck there is no manager on duty ever no raise oh yeah i have worked here for a year and have not gotten a raise and i ve asked multiple time and overall just a toxic environment after yesterday i wa sent over the edge and immediately went out looking for job and filling out application like a mad man i know it might seem like i am overreacting a bit i get that there are much worse working condition but i am just scratching the surface here there is so much i want to say but this post would be a freaking book so yeah i m working on getting out of a toxic work environment and i recommend those who are in the same boat do the same seems like every time thing get somewhat better something stupidly outrageous happens that just nullifies everything tl dr unorganized workplace ha pushed me to my breaking point and officially avidly looking for a new job

first time poster on mobile yadayadayada i am not a server but saw this happen last night hopefully it s okay to post here so last night my wife and i went to a cat caf for the first time where they serve coffee and pastry at a bar and have a room full of cat to hang out with and play with all of the cat are also available for adoption these kind of place have been around for a while and i love the idea a we were ordering and waiting for our turn in the cat room this guy come out and approach the counter pretty irritated he proceeds to interrupt u walk around behind the counter and start bitching at the poor barista i didn t catch everything he said but he had some issue with the cat not behaving how he wanted them to maybe they weren t giving him enough attention if he wa a unpleasant in there a he wa out here it s no wonder despite this guy interrupting and invading her counter the barista gave him the standard perfunctory apology and patiently explained sir they are cat they have mind of their own and won t always do exactly what you want them to do he launched into i paid xx for this and this is just ridiculous barista repeat well they re cat i m sorry you didn t enjoy your time here tonight but they re cat and there s nothing i can do this went in circle for a minute until the guy seemed to finally realize how absurd he wa being and stormed out so the barista and i just shared a wtf look and burst out laughing people are crazy
this happened late july at my last hotel a generally sleepy little suburban full service branded franchise hotel i wa nominally director of room at the hotel but i spent more time working a a fd agent and night auditor at this place than i ever have since becoming a manager the fd had an fom and supervisor so i wa frequently mod or even just a one man show this is the story of the worst day of my year career it all started on a saturday it had been my day off so the wife and i had driven out to the coast had lunch at a new place and generally just a great time then my phone rang caller id said it wa my fom calling me never a good sign kaoswzrd we re totally fucked in the background i heard the fire alarm going off now at our hotel when the alarm went off the fire department required u to evacuate the entire building until they cleared u for reentry i first experienced that while taskforcing at the hotel my first weekend there a pain in the as but had happened often enough that i knew my fom could handle just a fire alarm what happened the guest in set off her fire sprinkler flooded her room everything around her and it s all raining down to the floor below what how i wa already stripping out of my weekend clothes and mentally debating whether i d take a shower before heading in or not i don t even know but i need you here i have my cousin s bachelorette trip this weekend and i m the maid of honor i need to leave in an hour i already knew we were sold out for the weekend sunday would have been my monday the sox were playing taylor swift had a concert at the football stadium on my way call the dorm and make sure we re hard closed for new booking at the very least i knew i d be relocating the impacted room i wa sweaty and needed a shave i opted to shower while my lovely wife pulled clothes and threw together an oh shit bag for me while i showered and shaved my phone exploded with call from my dorm chief engineer and gm i called my gm from the call he wa out of the state on his way back but wouldn t be on the scene till sunday at the soonest the shitshow wa my show by the time i arrived the fire department and building inspector were on the scene and the hotel wa still under evacuation i walked into the middle of the conversation between the city official and my fom we re closing the hotel the building inspector the entire hotel my stomach clenched hold on you need to explain this to my gm i got the gm on the phone with the building inspector if anyone wa gonna twist this guy s arm into not shutting u down it wa him but no luck while the gm wa trying to work his magic i got caught up to speed the date of the best man for one of the wedding we had in house we had wedding group that weekend had hung her dress up in the room from a fire sprinkler a fire sprinkler that had a little sign next to it with a crossed out clothes hanger on it seriously the dress hadn t just triggered the sprinkler it had snapped the sprinkler head out of the fixture so they d had to shut off the entire sprinkler system to stop the water the building wa story tall she wa on the th floor at the beginning of the hall and directly over the lobby so it wa raining in the bar so final word from the building inspector wa that he wa pulling our occupancy permit for the entire building and he wasn t going to clear u until an electrician could certify that all the wiring in the flooded section wasn t compromised all of this boiled down just in time for my fom to leave it wa about pm so i got on the pa and made a building wide announcement most of our guest were down in the lobby or just outside the front door but i knew there were at least a few still upstairs despite the building alarm and instruction to evacuate thus began the process of relocating room from the hotel into a sold out market plus on site wedding for sunday it wa a marathon our sale coordinator and group room coordinator heard what wa going on from other staff and came in to help my fd agent buckled in it wa actually a tremendous marathon of teamwork that i m still very proud of i m sure you all can imagine reaction ranged from understanding and gracious to red faced rage and everything in between most people were super understanding far more than i expected but the difficult one were a pain because there wa literally nothing i could do i m glad i didn t find this out until much later but the guest who had caused the entire disaster wa heard out in the parking lot complaining that the water from the sprinkler had messed up her hair and destroyed her dress i don t know if i could have controlled myself if she d come to complain to me about it i wa on the desk until about am that night morning until i finally felt like my night auditor could handle the remaining or arrival which we had located room for i went to one of our illegal to occupy but dry room and passed out for a couple of hour then came back down to greet the am fd agent we d had hope of getting reopened that day sunday it didn t happen or the next day i ended up not leaving the building until sunday evening at about pm when our dorm came in to be mod and relieve me went home passed out came back in first thing monday morning monday s relocation were the toughest they were all of our regular business traveler generally understanding and i wa able to email most and reroute them before they showed up at the hotel most of the people screaming at me at the fd had stopped by that point even when we reopened on tuesday we still had a ton of room out of order for month i worked a lot on the final insurance claim well over a quarter of a million dollar i know the guest who caused it didn t have anything to put a dent in it no idea if insurance went after her but i made sure they had her contact information

i spent a few minute posting this on a local fb industry page decided halfway through that it would fit better here story time i ll make this a short a possible i worked in a bar restaurant that had men s woman s room a well a a handicapped bathroom one time during happy hour the place wa in the financial district so it wa mainly lunch and happy hour next to no one in there after pm a woman and two men came in i wa working service well seat restaurant so pretty busy and the first two seat at the seat bar anyway these people were great understanding that i m serving nearly the whole restaurant had their order and cc ready they were drinking but didn t seem excessive but the woman wa le than half the size of both men so maybe the beer hit her harder anyway about an hour and a half in the men kinda flag me down i m still in the shit but they ve been great so i give them priority i ask what s up turn out that one of the men is the woman s boyfriend she had gone to the bathroom a long time earlier and bf wa worried he wanted me to go i to the restroom and check on her totally fair i told my cohort that i wa disappearing for a minute and he covered me i went into the lady room and nothing it wa getting late so literally no one wa in there except for the older woman washing her hand i kicked door in so obviously gf must be in the handicapped bathroom right probably puking poor thing i check on my fellow bartender to make sure he s fine and maybe he know where the key to the bathroom is he ha no clue and is fine so i knock on the door for the second time give it some space then knock again time music is loud but not that loud i assume she is passed out and something could be going badly for her i go into a deep dive for the key still can t find the key but then i put two and two together none of those bar bathroom key need an actual key so i grab a mailbox key or whatever and shove it into the lock the boyfriend and friend were standing behind me the door open and fucking a my goddamn food runner wa in there taking a goddamn shit for like minute he scream huerta i kept saying i wa in here i randomly saw him working at another restaurant recently i made sure the entire staff knew about the mario pooping story eta thank you u justwannareadstories for reminding me about min after the discovery of the pooping food runner the girlfriend texted the boyfriend she felt drunk so went home incredibly anti climactic but at least she wa safe
we had a four top walk in today the first thing the host asks me is if i m okay to be sat outside of my section we are understaffed so i say sure i wasnt in the weed and i wanted to do my part to maintain the floor these people had already been giving the host a hard time about where they wanted to sit they then had the host wipe their booth down twice even then it wasn t clean enough the rest of their party their son and daughter arrived fifteen minute later by that time the mother had already shoved trash in my hand and had continuously complained about the booth we offered to move them but they refused by the time their food arrived i had already established this would be my neediest table i did not neglect them but i did not prioritize them either their service wa provided in a timely manner when i checked in on them the mother said can i get some water i looked at her glass and i said water a if she wanted an extra glass she said yes is there a problem i said no not a problem at all and i got her the water when i returned to the table to clear off plate the son wa speaking conspiratorially the father looked at him to hush him up but the son just kept talking he said she ha no idea what s going on in fact even though she s here i m still going to keep talking the father awkwardly tried to change the subject while i cleared plate when i dropped the check i told them sorry i had no idea what wa going on today and i looked right at the son he just stared at the table smiling shaking his head refusing to look me in the eye i went back to my four other table i could see the son holding his phone threateningly while speaking to my manager in the lobby i doubted he wa telling her that he wa shit talking me to my face a if he wa so entitled and everyone else would be too dumb to understand the family left my manager didn t approach me thirty minute later i made eye contact with my manager and i smiled grimly she approached me and said wow that man wa so rude i said i know did he tell you he tried to shit talk me while i wa bussing their table to me surprise he had told her he had said that i had walked up while he wa saying how awful i wa and that i had made a rude comment calling him out he held his phone the entire time a if he were about to detonate a yelp review he said that if i worked for him i would be fired i would never work for a greasy neck beard btw because greasy neck beard can t maintain themselves let alone business my manager had told him it sounded like i tried to make the best out of an awkward situation and that she would have responded the same way of course these people didn t tip me and of course they left an awful review the experience wa horrific but my manager had my back i m grateful for that even though a nasty man who s banned from buffalo wild wing i peeped at his other google review think i m a shitty server

hi guy here s a tale of when i used to work the desk at a salon and spa i wa still fairly new when this little event happened maybe not even employed for a full year yet shortly after i started at the salon we moved location to a new spot about two block away this spot wa way better a much bigger space with even more parking however the new location wa next to a very popular brunch place and some other medical office so during certain hour weekend especially parking would be horrendous seriously you could do lap in the parking lot for minute and still not find a spot therefore especially after we moved location we always told guest on the phone to arrive at least minute before the start of their appointment to allow some time to find parking here s another thing to note anyone showing up minute late to their service would have their spot immediately forfeited and would need to come back another day even if they were in the parking lot the whole time trying to find a spot i understood why we were doing it it just suck being the bearer of bad news here s where the late client come in to play this guest claimed that she wa a regular client of my salon owner bos who also did hair a couple of day out of the week at each of his two salon i remember this guest s appointment wa scheduled in our opening hour on a saturday which meant that the parking lot outside wa crazy busy i remember her calling the salon because she went to the old location instead of the new one okay a slight red flag if you re a regular because we had already been at the new spot for a few month i give her easy direction it wa a straight shot around the corner and through a parking structure from the old spot to the new spot i kindly asked if she could get here a soon a possible because late guest were subject to get rescheduled then she finally walk into our salon husband and stroller in tow at least minute late to her haircut my bos s appointment ran on minute block meaning every minute a guest is starting their service with him if guest are arriving at the salon minute before the start of their appointment this mean she arrived at about the same time a my owner next guest she wa clearly very upset when she arrived because she knew i wa about to tell her that she need to come back another day my owner must ve been able to tell this might go south when she came in and i remember him stepping away from his current client to have a chat with her i start working with another client who wa paying for their service and that s when i heard fuck you asshole from the late guest a my bos is opening the front door to kick her and her family out everyone in the salon turned to see what wa happening and i remember another client who wa cashing out staring with wide eye and giggling this late guest did not like that she wa being turned away and i completely understand that it s super frustrating trying to get somewhere and being turned away at the last second but sometimes people don t like to see thing from the other perspective that if you re not on time for your appointment it make the stylist run late for the rest of their day running behind a a stylist is extremely stressful you re on time when you re minute early you re late when you re on time i wish that wa branded into everyone s brain i freak out if i m arriving even minute before the start of any appointment i don t remember her getting irate with me this happened almost year ago but i do remember my bos telling me afterward to never allow anyone to talk down or disrespectful to me he told me that the late guest only come time a year with him every week he ha way more guest he see anywhere between week to week so she wasn t a regular enough for him to fuck up the rest of his day for this story probably came out much longer than it needed to but i do have other wild story both from my time at the salon a well a from my current job at my cute little boutique hotel if anyone is interested like the time a stalker came into the salon with a machete on his belt and another time when this tiny little girl caused k in damage to a suite and had to get carried out by police edit by tiny i mean a petite year old adult maybe barely foot and pound max my bad for being misleading
it hurt me worse when i get insulted by customer at my job serving that i ve done so well in and made so much money doing and never had any major problem doing and feel like i m one of the best in my restaurant and i get a lot of compliment when i serve from customer but the one that insult me just hurt so much cause people can be so toxic like don t give af about the person serving the food but worry about why they don t like how it taste when they ordered it and turn on me a if i cooked it it just suck just make me hate this industry even more every day cause i get insulted by people over little hiccup sometimes i ve had many other chance to get out of serving job and do other job where i don t have to see a person but i chose serving because i like interacting with people i like making people feel good when they have a good experience but damn it hurt when people bring you down and it happens not very often but than i get mostly on sunday the christian church group just shocking how middle age men and woman can be so cruel and such asshole

sorry for the boring title but i wasn t sure how to sum this story up i used to work a a server in a garden centre restaurant i m i had nothing else to do i m not sure if they have there everywhere but in england it s basically a plant shop with a cafe joined on one really busy day an elderly man in a mobility scooter his daughter and his granddaughter came in which isn t too uncommon a our main market wa older people with family who are always sweet and are some of my favourite customer they all sat at a table near the back of the restaurant next to a walkway which is basically a route for all server to walk along that go through the restaurant so we can assist people that call u over a bit later the daughter had gone to the bathroom so it wa just him and his granddaughter i wa walking away from him when i heard him shout so i turned around and walked back to him this is where it get creepy he said i love watching you young girl bend over you re just so lovely he then proceeded to make more comment to the other young female server about their behind making u all more uncomfortable the longer it went on none of the other server wanted to talk about it to our manager after we had told one of the older server who just said that he wa being sweet i told the manager and she just said that she wouldn t do anything until he touched one of u we all proceeded to watch a he stared at u walking around with his daughter giving u weird look for how much we were all staring back and they didn t leave until about an hour later i quit my job soon after because of more stuff like this but obviously never that extreme again
our hotel ha been going to hell for some time and the owner manager hasn t done much to try and get thing better even before i came in year ago the building wa in kind of disrepair with couch broken and unusable carpet and wallpaper not replaced until he had to and strange electrical problem lately he s begun to berate u at the front desk for not caring about the property despite the fact that his idea for improving are thing like planting flower i just had a sit down with him at my insistence to see if he would be willing to give me a budget and the authority to make purchase necessary i tell him again about how people aren t happy that the couch mostly don t work right to which he talked about the cost of replacing he seemed to break down a little when i told him that the furniture store next door had sleeper sofa for le than he wa expecting so we sit down for real in the lobby it s a slow day today and talk about thing he want to do like focus on a limited number of room to get fully up to speed including cannibalizing good equipment from bad room fair enough it s good to know he ha some kind of plan he try to go off on a tangent about room rate and color scheme and i led him go through it but i hammer in one particular change that we need to do and it won t cost all that much to do each of the single room ha light socket connected to light switch by the door apparently when he built the place he wanted there to be a full body mirror with a light next to it but the contractor messed it up and he never finished what he wanted a side effect of this is that one set of plug is connected to the light switch which housekeeper keep using to plug in the fridge microwave tv or cable box so for year i ve had to ask guest i know it seems silly but is the light switch turned on it s too late to fix the error now without tearing up the wall but i proposed a simple fix install dummy switch into the wall so the plug are always on ordinarily when i bring up the idea he pass it over without thinking he doesn t seem to realize that guest complain about problem in the room to the front desk then complain about the front desk online but this time he actually considered it he came up with an answer to the problem naturally one that would cost him le money than i proposed but is going to try to set it up in one of the room tomorrow it s a start since this guy is so weird sometimes

it had been a silent night and my blood pressure wa alright this normallooking couple in their fourties come to the front desk to check out they give me the room number after me smiling them welcome i ask if they had a pleasant stay and expected the regular respond stupid me no we couldn t sleep at all someone in the room next door beated up a woman all night we did not a second of sleep because of the screaming and bouncing my smile froze and my mind went back to every second of the nightshift in an attempte to remember the missed call we did not have a lot of queue during the shift and i could not recall any missed call so i asked when they did the call to the front desk regarding this no we did never call the front desk but we could not sleep it wa horrendous they said i stared at them when did you call the police then i asked while i searched for who else stayed in the same part of the hotel it wa just them and an other couple checked in the same corridor because we had a low occupancy the other couple had already left at the express checkout without the staff ever see them leaving we did not call the police it wa the worst hotelstay ever we could hear the scream all night i realized then that my faith in mindkind wa over i am not sure if i excused myself or if i just left them hanging there at the front desk but i went back office asked my manager to handle them because i could not do it i told her the short story and she made the check out i ended my shift earlier that day i remember that i asked my manager if we could blacklist guest just being bad human but i am not sure what happened with that edit sorry i should have noted this already when i posted it from the beginning the guest had left the room in a mess it wa blood in the room and some of the interior wa broken so the summary wa that the lowlife scumbags listen to another lowlife scumbag hitting his partner without lifting a fucking finger litterly did not lift a finger to press a button to maybe save someone s life this still make me sick it ha been a while now but it make me fucking angry just thinking about it

i work at a maliott hotel my roommate booked a room for the weekend in the city with his girlfriend for valentine at a maliott property and just got an email saying he s been relocated to a place minute from where he wa supposed to be he came knocking on my door asking me to explain i don t work at the place he s staying at he just know i ll have knowledge of the situation and i tell him exactly what happened maliott doesn t give a shit whether or not he ha a room at that property a long a it sell out they oversold the room on purpose for the sake of getting to and didn t care how it impacted the guest who were willing and ready to pay to stay there he wa furious he asked me what he could do and i told him the truth absolutely fuck all i told him he could try calling but it likely wouldn t help much because they ve probably already evaluated all the arrival for today and decided who is the best least problematic people to walk he call them yelling and rightfully so he ha every right to be upset even i a someone who ha had to walk countless people can admit that after talking with the manager he wa offered a double bed room instead of the suite they had booked clearly he wasn t ok with that he then find out the place they were walking him to wa a massive downgrade in quality so he just cancel the room now they re on their way to the city frantically finding something that will work for them this is what the asshats at corporate don t see the stress and frustration overselling intentionally put on their guest obviously we fda s see it all the time if you re unfortunate enough to work for a chain that employ this sale strategy i never judge someone or get frustrated when they re yelling at me for being walked it entirely avoidable bullshit and should be illegal what a joke of a sale strategy but the people at corporate are coward and shield themselves from the truth of it i once got a write up for telling an irate guest the sale strategy and directing them to file a corporate complaint corporate want their cake and to eat it too bunch of idiot who only care about the money in their pocket

to the fat guy who couldn t stop asking me if the steak he just ate wa vegan when i wa clearing his table the first time i said of course i made it myself the second time i said absolutely for sure all of our steak are vegan the third time i said what is vegan an island in the south pacific i don t have the social capital available to riff that much on a joke that bad no one laughed and it wa equal part embarrassing and exhausting we were short staffed and i had other stuff to do i m going to let everyone in on a secret vegan don t care that you eat meat meat eater don t care that you re a vegan no one give a shit what anyone else eats except for people who mistake their diet for their identity these people are a lot rarer than everyone else just eating the food they like most people don t try to turn their diet into a crusade most people aren t insecure enough to care if you re a vegan who is annoyed with meat eater or worse a meat eater who is annoyed with vegan you should really look inward the problem isn t the diet you think that you re diametrically opposed to the problem is actually just the people who care what other people eat if i have a guest with a dietary restriction that s obnoxious i provide them with delicious food because they re guest realistically i invite them over for food slightly le often than my other friend but i don t consider their diet an attack on my own lifestyle that s insane but my enlightened tolerance of vegan and meat eater doesn t pay my bill doe anyone got a better response to a militant meat eater who won t stop asking if his steak wa vegan no matter how many time i try to riff with his awful joke
i work at a fairly small hotel that ha a word in it that defines a plot of land in which you use to plant seed ect this is the best way to explain for the story to make sense without saying the name of the hotel chain back to the point we only have room and floor people like to leave terrible rating i assume because they have nothing else better to do but the comment that some people have left u have my coworkers and i in tear it s quite entertaining to read sometimes especially if you re having a bad day and need a laugh remember before when i mentioned how small our hotel is we do have floor a pool fitness ect like most other hotel however we do not hove anything like an atrium at our hotel here s the comment we received even though the hotel name is it doe not have one a i had looked forward to perhaps an atrium to greet the visitor in the autumn a fucking atrium yeah let me just send my maintenance team over to walgreens and pick up the supply for your atrium so they can get started on that for you would you like a helicopter pad a well maybe a zoo ive yet to see a hotel with an atrium let alone butterfly which they added to their travilcity comment which we get to see a well and then continued to rant about how terrible our hotel is probably because we didn t have an atrium it wa a really funny to everyone at the time and my gm ended up replying to the guest with something hilarious unfortunately i cannot for the life of me remember what it wa

i m currently working in a hotel in the f amp b department it s doesn t have a white glove service either pretty casual and whatnot i usually treat my guest with the usual gent folk fella or even guy one hour ago management called me upstairs and during an evaluation they said for me to avoid saying any of these my manager since we must treat our guest by name and that s it if you don t like it you can open your own shitty cafe and call your guest gent or folk over there here you do it by our rule next time i catch you saying anything similar you can start thinking of going home when i said i asked some american and british guest this question if it wa alright they said i wa pretty stupid since this can comeback to them because a client may complain to upper management how we re not being taught how to speak to guest they were somehow dumbfounded about me asking this since we re all not native in english is it that bad to call a young couple guy or when two guy are together by fella do you use these term in america in hotel i kinda feel like i m alone here none of my colleague agree with me and just npc through their work day edit thought better to remove the name of the hotel lest i burn myself hehe thanks to all for the response a i d thought it s pretty normal but i ll follow management advice although when no one s around i won t be able to help myself

our event coordinator ha apparently been in contact with an agency for a while to book a block of room for a posse of model they hemmed and hawed and it wasn t until today that they booked with u at two pm a little background about my hotel we re a teensy boutique hotel that s primarily a luxury resort for couple very low occupancy no double room we get the paperwork together for all the check in and it s not until we have the first model check in that thing start to get interesting turn out it s a bunch of child model and their family their complaint are a follows no double room or rollaways which suck for all the people that brought the whole nuclear fam a few of them wound up having to book second room with their own money which a one angry mom put it defeat the purpose of getting paid i totally get it and i have no idea why anyone would book child and their family into our hotel which clearly ha room spec on the website the restaurant close early at pm and the family are pissed because they ve driven about six hour to get up here their shoot is in the very early hour of the morning before the restaurant open up for brunch and even though i told i d be letting night audit know to set up a continental breakfast earlier than normal but there wa still complaint that there aren t coffee maker in the room themselves not being grouped all next door to each other a lot of the kid are pal so they were all hoping to be roomed together but because of the late booking alternating room size in our floor plan the kid all wound up pretty spread out how very sad the pool ha fixed hour our pool heater shuts off at to respect the room close to the pool and the family wa under the impression that the kid would be able to swim to get rid of nerve add this all up with the pleasure of the group arriving at the same time crowding into my little bitty square foot lobby and it s been wicked hectic not to mention the noise complaint coming in from the regular guest staying with u tl dr child and their family come to a couple resort and are woefully let down
i ve been a server at a brunch place since we opened in september of last year when i interviewed i express interest about being behind the bar since i had year of high volume coffee expierance i lacked bar experience so they offered me a server position and would keep me on the list to be cross trained once there wa a spot for me fast forward to now a lot of people either left because business is slow the location is in a new shopping plaza that is not completely done but will be late spring or they got fired i believe there is now a spot available at the bar i ve been working on my pours at home since my bf wa a bartender for year he s been helping is it wrong to talk to manager about crosstraining i do not want to overstep and a part of me think that it should be offered and not asked for though i really hate the idea of being overlooked i love working with the espresso machine and miss it alot thanks
first and foremost i work at a hotel that isn t located in the u so how we got about checking people in differs a little mostly because of legal reason if you have any question about it please leave a comment and i ll get to it also a tl dr is available at the bottom anyways a my previous story start i m a night auditor at a hotel which mean that not only i m quite intimate with sleep deprivation i m also a master of the art of compliance with that in mind not only i m supposed to make sure my colleague are doing everything right and clean up after their mistake but i m also supposed to do everything by the book literally everything ever hear of an auditor that doesn t do thing by the book well if you did they weren t a very good auditor to begin with our story begin on a hot summer night in fact too hot even for a summer night especially for a hot summer night on a tropical country where our sleep deprived overworked and underpaid hero wa on duty his colleague wa also on duty so the sleep deprivation would soon be solved while finishing up the audit he receives a call from a man who sounded quite aggravated by the fact that the a c in his home wa busted he asked what our rate were and our availability and said he d be arriving in minute and he d like u to leave the a c on already so the room would cool down nothing wrong there we ve done this before and all wa set we were just waiting for them to arrive upon arrival we asked if they d like help with the bag and while the wife pointed out to my colleague what to carry upstairs i started checking in her husband and their two daughter the law in this country mandate that in order for u to allow a minor to stay in a hotel room their legal guardian must present some form of valid id for the minor id card passport or their birth certificate we also do not accept copy it must be the original normally this isn t an issue a every traveler here is well aware of such requirement but sometimes people forget them you know how it is see at first when i asked the husband to present such document he got riled up and mouthed off why are you questioning my good repute they re my daughter i m not kidnapping anyone our hero me informed the guest that it wa a legal matter the law demanded it surely he d understand especially being a lawyer unfortunately he didn t like that answer and began playing hardball must ve been the heat i m sure but upon being informed that i would not check him in he sighed and also mentioned one of his daughter wa adopted which meant that he d also have to present proof that they were in fact the legal guardian for one of his daughter not sure what to do and already very aggravated by the heat and the nigth auditor s preposterous demand for documentation he spoke with his wife got into his car and drove off to get the document minute later he returned and sensing an impeding conflict our hero asked his colleague to stay at the front desk should thing get anymore heated than they already were quickly entering the hotel the hotheaded guest pretty much flung the required documentation at the front desk and when our hero reached for it to see if it wa indeed the necessary documentation the guest began mouthing off how will you even know if these are real are you even competent enough to analyse these document you should probably get in touch with your legal department now our hero ha already been through such thing before what s with lawyer anyways do they think they rule the world after they passed the bar and began trying to de escalate the situation the hotheaded now red with rage smoke blowing out of his ear and huffing and puffing like a wolf about to blow apart a little piggy s house doubled down on escalating thing why am i being put through this yet again i m being humiliated in front of my family i demand that you give me a written document stating why i m being forced to present these document i want your full name and your employee number being a polite yet firm a any seasoned hotel worker can be i informed the fire elemental who wa quite angry that i would give him no such document and if he did not calm down i would have to call security he wa le than thrilled and began to spontaneously combust even more now his wife who must ve been some sort of buddha calmly walked to the front desk and began trying to calm down her devil of a husband saying that i wa in fact correct for demanding such documentation in fact it wa all going well until she reminded him that it wa odd that a hotel in the next town over didn t demand such documentation from them in fact in all their travel through this tropical paradise of a country no hotel had in fact ever even aluded to such document this only served to aggravate the fire elemental more and a his eye turned to white hot ember our hero ever doughty started to slowly reach for the panic button under the desk while informing the man and his wife that he would have to call security if thing did not calm down the wife inconvenienced by the idea of having to drive around at am to look for another hotel room with a c reminded her husband yet again that our hero wa in fact correct and that unless he wanted to sleep by himself on the sidewalk he would calm down and stop making a fuss he did calm down but not before mouthing off one last time that no other hotel in this country had ever even asked for any of his offspring s document having no other resort our hero attemped binding the fire elemental with a simple yet nearly unbreakable spell see knowing a demon s occupation give you power over them so i asked the fire elemental are you a lawyer and he replied togheter with a smug smile yes i am in fact i ve been a lawyer for year now what doe this have to do with anything well our hero being a somewhat seasoned hotel worker then asked the fire elemental well sir then you are aware that according to insert specific law here you are required to present the minor s id or birth certificate and that according to insert other specific law here since one of your daughter is adopted you have to provide proof that you are her legal guardian after a bried silence the fire elemental sighed shrieked a little even and loudly declared damn you to hell you re correct you re far too correct having being met with an unbreakable spell of binding the fire elemental now turned human told his wife i don t like him and i don t like this hotel let s go somewhere else the wife sighed in a way that only someone exhausted by the heat and sleep deprivation could and promptly put her daughter in the car so they could hopefully find somewhere cool and comfortable to spend the night a for our hero after the aggravated fire elemental and his family departed he cracked a small yet cheeky smile and thought to himself no a c s going to cool that hotheaded man and proceeded to resume watching netflix on his cellphone too long didn t read family attempt to check in without their daughter s minor id their father a lawyer go full fire elemental in a blaze of rage his wife try to calm thing down but it doesn t work the night auditor quote the lawyer turned fire elemental the specific law that make him demand id to check in minor the fire elemental is defeated by a simple spell of binding and decides to leave the hotel with his family and look for somewhere else to stay edit forgot to add the too long didn t read before posting added it

a guy walk in inquiring if we have a lounge for shiny member we don t have a lounge a we are a select service brand so we tell the guest that we don t have lounge at our brand he proceeds to ask u to call the hotel in our area that may have it and ask them if he and his peer can be let in to their lounge so they can use the space until their next meeting we attempt to call the hotel nearby and no one is having it how lounge work is that you have to be a guest at the hotel with lounge and is only accessible to elite shiny member this guy isn t staying at our hotel and we don t know if he is staying at any hotel in the area he continues to ask u to call the milton brand because he is also an elite shiny member with those brand we attempt and all the response we got were that he ha to be a guest at that particular hotel he start going off how a an elite shiny member he should be able to access the lounge even though he isn t staying at these hotel or ours he state he is going to contact corporate about this we are all looking at him confused at how he is acting butt hurt he can t get something for free i don t understand the entitlement of some guest that mostly travel for work most guest aren t spending a penny of their own money at the hotel most if not all the money they spend is expensed back to their company why feel like you are owed the hotel employee unborn child because you spend your company money at our brand

part http www reddit com r talesfromthefrontdesk comment eqt n the mystery of the potential crack head part http www reddit com r talesfromthefrontdesk comment er v o the mystery of the potential crack head i don t even know how long it ha been since i posted part while this same guy ha significantly cut back there have still been some issue the first didn t happen to me but happened to of my co worker on saturday they are just doing their thing and they noticed a guy sitting in a semi hidden part of the lobby they began to ask him question and the guy said he wa here to see some dude however at first this guy couldn t remember the guest s name he wa here to see when asked the room number he didn t know it after about minute of him hanging around waiting for this dude they made him leave come to find out he had been hanging around since around am one would think that after all of this they would finally kick out the guest nope that said some people are easy to miss when it busy between and but i would think someone would have seen him before freaking pm saturday night this guest came down and got one person and that wa it sunday night came around all wa quiet nothing happened and i thought i wa going to have a great night not having to deal with this guy and his crack head am exactly here come one to the door trying to get in and telling me who he is here to visit and this guy didn t get the right room number either however he did tell me the right floor i told this guy exactly what i told the guest too he need to contact the guest to let him in i wouldn t let him in because the guest wa told week ago that he ha to physically come down and get his visitor i step outside for a smoke at this time and what do i see but the guest throwing his room key down to the crackhead the crack head came through my front door and into the elevator i immediately called the guest and told him that i know he wa told not just by me but by at least one other person that he must physically come and get his guest and not can t drop them a key he wa told at least other time hopefully with his breaking that rule i can finally get him out of here

i ve been seeing a few post on here recently about nice guest so i thought i would share a story about some nice guest i had i went to a community college and took a hospitality and tourism course and it wa divided between hotel operation and food and beverage i didn t like the f amp b aspect a much but i still did my best our class sometimes paired up with the culinary class and we would serve dinner for the public in our dining room and there wa a couple from town that had been going to these dinner for like year they liked to see how the student progressed throughout the year and they loved the food after i graduated i moved to the city to work in a hotel i remember on my second day an older couple got off the elevator and went into the breakfast room the man looked at me and i thought he looked familiar it wa the couple that went to our dinner they came to talk to me and still remembered me even though it had been over a year fast forward to last fall and i started working on a cruise ship i had my f amp b instructor on facebook and she messaged me saying that she told that couple what i wa up to now and they were so proud of me i haven t seen them since the time in the hotel but i thought it wa so sweet of them to still ask about me after all these year
i wa working the concierge desk helping out a guest she forgot her id so she sent her kid up to get it since our elevator are pretty shit i knew it would take a while so there wa going to be lot of standing around for a bit another woman walked up behind her with her son and they started whispering to each other hurriedly knowing that this transaction would be a minute and sensing that this woman may be a karen with the way she wa talking to her son i let her know that anyone at the front desk can assist her with any question she might have the way our lobby is set up is that we have a concierge desk directly across the lobby from the front desk i could see that there wasn t a line and if karen had turned around she would have seen it too so i tell her that anyone at the front desk can help her and in true karen fashion snippily reply well do i have to go to the front desk i say no but i m currently in the middle a transaction and i wasn t sure if you needed your question answered immediately well i wa going to offer a compliment but you know what nevermind and the wild karen storm out never to be heard from again my guest just turn back around after wanting to witness a true karen in the wild and asks do you get that a lot you have no idea ma am

i am not a server currently i work elsewhere but i wa plus i have friend who are server at many type of resturants this lady is an uber driver in her s she wa complaining about only getting a dollar tip which from what i know it take a lot of effort to see if a specific rider tipped you her and this guy in his s start talking about how much she should get tipped which according to a google search wa which of course they said oh like a server to which i said well a lot of server don t get still i wa a server and have friend who are server so then they proceed to just start like agressively asking where i wa a server i answered at a movie theater which i guess just completely invalidated my argument this lady start going off like well you never see the server and i try to explain that well yes you do but she won t let me get a word in where i wa a server we went into the theater to take your order we took payment we ran the food we gave refill we did what a regular server would do but in an extremely dark room up and down stair anyways i try to also add in i have friend that work in every type of resturant but they won t hear it repeating that server must be tipped well edit she is also a bad uber driver in my opinion she hang around my job after accepting ride making the person wait plus she will accept ride look where they are then hope the rider cancel so she doesn t have to take them can t imagine what people who actually have her arrive deal with edit i forgot to add their whole arguement of it depends where you work piss me off like if you work at a cheaper place or a movie theater you don t deserve tip
never happened when i wa serving a a manager i have seen it happen a few time usually weed but i have seen some harder stuff given and it wa usually on top of a decent cash tip when i wa a bartender i someone try to give me weed but i ve never really liked it so i told him i didn t want it i have always said if you want to find something a server or someone in the industry will know how to find it one night a manager i wa taking a smoke break cigs a couple block from the restaurant i managed i guess looking back i looked a little sketchy because i wa standing by a fence smoking never liked smoking close to the place i work in case a guest saw me plus i liked to wonder with the limited time i have anyways an extremely drunk guy walk up to me with not so drunk friend and asked me for coke i looked at his friend and laughed thinking is this guy for real i said no and drunk dude looked at me and said ahh come on i guess that they thought that s why i wa hanging out a block off of a street with a lot of bar honestly probably could have have arranged it but wouldn t have for many reason i don t really mess with anything like that anymore i am definitely not doing it for a random person walking up to me i told his friend they needed to get him home and to be careful who they walk up to asking for drug asking the wrong person could have gotten then robbed or even worse bartending i always had people ask for stuff but i stayed away from it the risk v reward wasn t worth it to me never know if it wa an undercover tabc agent or even undercover police i always thought anyone that desperate to ask a random bartender probably shouldn t be doing coke to begin with a a server bartender i have had people offer thing not a a tip but just randomly through the time i wa taking care of them one night i had a group of people and one of them kept saying you know anyone that want some hydros i laughed and acted a if it wa a joke until they kept saying it i realized they weren t joking but that is exactly how server are able to find just about anything a person may want at one point in my life i moved away from dallas trying to leave a certain way of life behind but i realized that again in this industry you can find anything without much effort

hello kiddy it s time for another tale from the tweaker file so last night wa not a good one i wa already exhausted when i came in for my audit shift because instead of sleeping i had spent the day installing a security system in my house my fault i know but needle to say i wa hoping for a quiet night of netflix and xbox since it wa the one night of the month that they take our system down for update it should have been smooth sailing not so much when i arrived at work i had to wait to get into the office so that my coworker could temporarily move trash can that were collecting water dripping from the ceiling this wa weird because not only had it not been raining there is a room directly above the office then i get the story apparently the long term guest don t get me started on that staying in the room above had clogged his toilet then tried to clear it with multiple bottle of drano when that didn t work he had tried to plunge it so aggressively that he broke the wax seal causing it to empty it content onto the bathroom floor of course he didn t tell anyone in time to get it mopped up before it soaked through the floor so yes the water dripping from the ceiling into my office wa toilet water that smelled heavily of chemical between that and my lack of sleep i developed a massive headache in no time even worse the leak wa right in front of my office door so try a i might i couldn t go in or out of my office without getting dripped on believe it or not he s not even the tweaker in the title because of the bathroom issue my coworker had tried to move him to another room he refused so a a compromise she gave him a key to an unused room to use the facility i m just getting settled into my shift when i get a call from the room with the toilet issue him who did you put in my room me huh him i went to go use the bathroom in that other room and there s someone in there me there shouldn t be him well there is the door s locked and the tv s on me i m sorry about that i ll check it out and call you back i first try calling the room no answer of course so i grab the emergency key that open any door even if the deadbolt is locked and a fresh key for the room to cancel out any old key when i get to the room i can hear someone inside i break out my cop knock not expecting an answer i m just about to use the key when the door finally open enter the tweaker me excuse me but who are you her defensively this is my friend s room me okay where s your friend her she s down at the casino she ll be back later me and what s her name she give it to me and i foolishly leave her in the room to go look up her friend s name in hindsight i realize i should have made her come with me but i wasn t thinking straight because of the headache when i get back to my desk i go to look up her friend s name in case she just had the wrong room then i remember the computer are down so i look through the paper registration which take a while not finding anything remotely similar i call my manager no answer again in hindsight i should have just called the cop but i wasn t thinking straight i call the room again and tell her there s nobody by her friend s name listed in the hotel her actually i called her and she said the room is actually her friend s me and what s that friend s name her i don t know me okay i m not sure what s going on here but i need you to come down here so i can scan your card and try to figure out what s going on her i don t have a key my friend let me in me i m still going to need you to come down her okay i hang up and my manager call me back i tell him the story and he tell me that there shouldn t be anybody in that room nor could anyone have been accidentally put in there because it wa taken out of order i call the room again and get no answer so i grab my key again and head up there of course the room is empty except for some white crystal on the bedspread i swipe the new key locking her out just in case she somehow got one occasionally i find key people have dropped in the hallway i went back to the desk to call the cop only to find one already there since we ve gotten a bad reputation the local pd ha assigned officer to stop in to check on u the one that come on my shift is pretty cool and just come in to b when he s having a slow night i tell him what happened and take him up to the room where he confirms that the crystal are meth he bag what he can and tell me to make sure to wash the bedspread before anyone stay in the room unfortunately since she already bailed there s not much he can do except to tell me to call him if she come back he took a description but i doubt it wa helpful she looked like a skinny tweaker chick a for how she got into the room i m guessing even though he swears he didn t that the guy from the room with the bathroom issue flipped the security latch so he wouldn t need the key to get back in along come tweaker chick she find an empty open room and decides to move in the rest of my night wa fairly uneventful except for the guy screaming at his wife gf hookup in the hall at am not much to tell there because he left before i could boot him infuriating side note my manager actually comped the guy with the clogged toilet a night a far a i m concerned he s been in there at least a couple of week the toilet worked fine when he checked in any problem with it were caused by him but whatever
this morning at about a girl come to the front desk telling me that she want to stay another night but she ha to go to court and need to get money off her card to pay for the room she s not sure if she ll be back by checkout time to pay for the room edit for clarity they were paid up to she said she wanted to pay for another night now giving people some leeway on paying a bit late is up to u but i wa a bit irked by her she say she ha court so obviously having somewhere to be wa not a surprise for her i felt she should have planned better i hate having to chase and hound folk for payment and decided she wasn t worth the slack she wa asking for i told her plainly that if she wasn t sure if she would be back by she would need to check out when she returned with payment in hand she would be more than welcome to check back in she tried to get me to budge but i insisted we would need payment by all the while thinking about how she could be using the time she wa spending arguing with me to go get the money off her card before she had to go to court there s an atm at the gas station across the street after she left someone came needing help with their door and i headed off to do that on my way back to the desk i saw her and a guy standing outside her room talking and pointing at me before the came over to me he looked like what we like to call at my hotel a crackity mckracken that name should be self explanatory he wa very skinny seemed a little off and had scab all over his face he tried arguing with me and i pointed out they should have planned better a we say a lack of planning on your part doesn t constitute an emergency on mine he argued that their plan had included me letting them pay late so naturally i disliked them even more suddenly because how stupid are you that you just assume you don t have to pay by check out he also used the argument that they had a lot of stuff and it would be hard to move adding to the list of thing that are not my problem i realized he wasn t going to back down so i told him a final time that we required payment by and that if they were unable to pay on time they would need to check out i turned around and walked back to the desk while he tried to reason with my backside fortunately he did not follow me five minute later he turned up at the desk asking for a manager surprise motherfucker it s me he leaf again mercifully having accepted i wasn t going to let him pay late and realizing that complaining to me about me would get him nowhere since i already know how awful of a person i am so am roll around and they ve not paid for the room and i ve not seen them leave at all not even for the court the girl supposedly had to go to they could have left without me noticing a we are a motel and they wouldn t need to cut through the lobby to leave but i didn t think it wa likely ten minute later still nothing and the bored owner go to do check out starting with them since i d already warned him about them sure enough they re both still in the room so i figure it s a safe bet that the claim about court wa bullshit and just them trying to stall for time for one reason or another this suspicion wa bolstered when the guy came down to pay for the room with the girl s card i told him no she ha to be here to sign for it so he said he d go get her ten minute haven t seen her and the bos go down to try again whoop except this time he realizes they ve been smoking in their nonsmoking room so he tell them to get lost crackity is so offended he demand our brand information so he can file a formal complaint we re so rude to him he doesn t even want to stay now good we don t want him to stay either the owner demand he get off the property a he s smoking in the room and clearly stalling for whatever reason so then crackity start threatening the bos since the bos is a bit of instigator i think crackity realized quickly though that the owner wasn t afraid to instigate since he could put his money where his mouth is because of the smoking in the room i immediately try to charge the card on file the same one the guy tried to pay with before the fund could be moved off the card i couldn t even get off it confirming that they really were just stalling or maybe that she had already thought to pull the money from her card either way good work spidey sens in the beginning i d almost worried i wa being too harsh but doubled down anyway since i m a stubborn fuck
i m sitting at the desk minding my own business in walk a guy who look like he like crack a little bit too much he try giving me a series of prepaid card a well a his plasma card and social security card in lieu of a bank or credit card for a deposit eventually he understands that i m not going to check him in without one and i send him along to the slightly sketchier hotel down the road that doesn t require a card but five minute later he s back trying to pay a cash deposit i reiterate that we have to have a card we don t do cash deposit his friend come up behind him trying to argue insisting that we do take cash deposit gt bran i m sorry i ve been here two and a half year so it s been at least that long since they stopped doing cash deposit gt liar i ve definitely paid a cash deposit here since then matter of fact you have taken a cash deposit from me gt bran no i didn t we don t do cash deposit gt liar it s been a few month but you did gt bran yeah that didn t happen gt liar i swear to you you took a cash deposit gt bran how much wa the deposit gt liar i don t remember gt bran because it didn t happen with impeccable timing my bos walk in through the front door completely oblivious to the conversation occurring and staring at his phone gt bran hey bos you d better fire me i guess i ve been taking cash deposit gt bos looking up from his phone confused huh we don t take cash deposit at this point the liar gave up and left dumbass picked the wrong person to lie about of all the people at the desk my bos know i m the biggest pain in the as about our credit card policy

the entire thing didn t happen to me but to a colleague i wa training the restaurant i worked at had a very good homemade tiramisu i know not all but our tiramisu is made with alcohol this isn t stated clearly in the menu so we always have to remind people who order it have had a few muslim order it and then thank me and order something else when i tell them there s alcohol in it a family wa eating in the restaurant two kid about and and their father everything had been good and they were very happy they then decided to have dessert one of the kid started by ordering the tiramisu it went something like this my colleague c oh sorry there s alcohol in the tiramisu would you like a chocolate cake instead or we have icecream aswell the kid didn t really seem upset but the father wasn t so amused father no it s okay he can have it i ll have the cr pe c i m so sorry but we re not allowed to serve alcohol to minor but we have other f i m his father and i say it s okay he ll have the tiramisu c sorry sir but i really can t do that kid it s okay dad i ll have the chocolate cake the father just shot a glare to the kid f i said he ll have the tiramisu c sir it s illegal for me to give alcohol to minor and it also wouldn t be good for him f i am his father and i know what s best for him he ll have the fucking tiramisu he wa yelling at this point and i heard that from another table and went over to help my colleague me hello sir what seems to be the problem f are you the manager this employee here is refusing to give my child dessert you should fire her my colleague quickly explained that he wanted the tiramisu me no sir i m not the manager but my colleague is just following the law we could really get in trouble if we serve anything with alcohol to minor he then turned to me with a smug smile f well then i ll have the tiramisu and the crepe me we can do that for you sir but if we were to see your kid eating from the tiramisu i m afraid we re forced to say something at this point he stood up and slammed his hand on the table ef no i m the fucking customer here and i m his father get me your manager you ll both regret this you ll be lucky if you have a job tomorrow i went and got the manager and surprise surprise he didn t give alcohol to the kid either and after a lot of discussion it came to this line ef well then i ll have a tiramisu to go and he ll eat it at my house you f ckers won t be able to stop me then seriously you re bragging to u that at home we won t be able to protect your kid from you the guy kept arguing and yelling until my bos kicked him out for disturbing other guest without his tiramisu to go he didn t tip i have no idea why i feel sorry for the kid who ha to grow up with such an asshole of a father edit oookay i hadn t exactly researched the law before simply cause it wa restaurant policy and we weren t allowed to do it just a we weren t allowed to sell thing from the kid menu to adult i know dumb but we could get fired for that but according to the law in my country outside of murica no one under the age of is allowed to consume any chocolate or cake with hard alcohol rum liquor and no one under is allowed to eat sauce made out of wine or beer we are instructed to follow that and the child didn t even want it and wouldn t have even liked it coffee and alcohol and even in really small amount a a parent i wouldn t expose my year old to alcohol if it isn t necessary because even if he can t get drunk there s no reason to do it and it isn t exactly good for him
sorry for the formatting i am on mobile this happened yesterday during our busy lunch rush hour i work at a family owned restaurant and am the only waitress we are usually super packed and busy during lunch hour and it can be very overwhelming at time but most of my customer understand and are patient the one and only most difficult person ever decided to come dine in during this busy time and decided to bring a friend along usually when i bring a menu i grab our utensil wrapped in a napkin and then bring glass of water to the table afterwards but this difficult lady always always give that disgusted look at the cup and say i m not drinking that i want it in a to go cup along with plastic utensil ok no problem but today we were very low on plastic cup and have to save them for to go order only i explained this to her and she kept the disgusted facial expression and say i don t care i m not going to drink off of that cup i have about other table to take care of so didn t want to argue with her so i went and fixed her a drink in a plastic cup and brought it to her once i sat it down her friend say oh i want it in a to go cup a well i repeated i know you heard me tell her that we are low on plastic cup her friend give me a stare and say i still want one by this time i m getting annoyed and asked to take their order and then turned to the difficult woman and said everytime you come here you are always so difficult and walked off to put her order in and take care of my other customer while i wa busy ringing up a door dash order the friend came up to the register and in a very rude tone say do you have any real silver ware i said your silverware is on your table wrapped in a napkin and she looked annoyed and said i meant plastic silverware i told the customer in front of me to wait one second then go and grab the plastic utensil and hand it to the rude friend whom snatched it out of my hand and walked off the customer in front of me said wow she is very disrespectful i just laughed and told her if only you knew later on after i wa done ringing everyone up and made sure everyone had their food i went to check up on all of my table once i reached the difficult woman and her friend i asked is everything ok can i get you anything else the friend replied in the same rude tone yeah we re fine now thanks for finally asking and the difficult woman say i don t like your customer service today i stood there and said i m sorry i really wanted to say if you re so disgusted about our food or hygiene why bother coming back all the time just stay home and cook or go elsewhere i always go out of my way to make sure you are satisfied with your order but this time you and your friend were just too much i am no longer going out of my way for you specifically because i work for tip only and no matter how hard i try to please you you are never satisfied and never even leave a tip the reason i said she is always difficult is because she is never satisfied she d order a fried rice and ask for the chicken on the side which is extra work for the chef especially while we were super busy sometimes the meal isn t spicy enough for her so she d send it back and have u remake it to her liking sometimes she even mix up her order and have u take the plate back because she didn t order that she meant to order something else and aside from all of that she always have that disgusted smirk and look when she come in to our restaurant anyway thanks for listening to me vent lol
welp i wa finally forced to find a new job due to how incredibly slow my restaurant continues to be even a we prepare for the busy season let me relieve all my grievance of this joint it s a local chain and from what i m told the higher ups in the company care nothing for anyone and that wa clear from the lowest employee up our district manager who wa based out of our location and managed some day quit because he wasn t respected enough which say something let s talk about him for a minute this guy introduces himself to me by telling him now keep in mind when you work with me anything that happens is just business don t take it personally well what that mean is that his management technique is literal bullying a small step out of line and he begin yelling at you he made at least one employee cry every shift he manged and when he wa asked to come and speak with a liquor rep or a customer he d say tell them i m not in today i literally jumped for joy when he quit brings me to the agm who wa kinda mentored by the district manager he started out cool enough but he very quickly began using the dm s language and i knew we had a problem this guy had no idea how to speak with customer and would literally yell or curse at them when they weren t where he wanted them or they complained nobody like this guy and we all agree he doesn t know what he s doing but according to the gm he s actually good compared to other people in the larger company so he kept his job i wa a host so we had to do a lot of togo order well i wa required to enter the customer s credit card info over the phone so it wa paid for beforehand i don t understand why anyone in their right mind would give out their full credit card info over the phone most bartender who you had to transfer to if a customer refused to give out their card info would be understanding but there wa one or two who would get so mad because that s not company policy not to mention if one of the more rigid manager heard of it you d get chewed out all for making the experience easier for the customer when you come to work you re there to do the job right there were so many server who were younger than me and still thought the world revolved around their own as we d get attitude consistently when trying to get server or bussers to do their damn job and finally worst of all our kitchen wa insanely inconsistent a i entered my togo i left distinct and exacting instruction of what the customer wanted these were noticed about of the time when i entered it on the po pretty consistently when i went back and told them but i shouldn t have to do that right i literally got my first yelp review calling me out by name because of the kitchen s inability to properly spread sauce on wing so why did i stay so long well the people there were pretty great other than the attitudey one honestly if the agm wasn t still around i d have dealt with everything else but it just becomes too crazy after a while
so this story still make me giggle even now these guest check out with me in the morning and i m so excited to hear about what other escapade they have had since they checked in friday night but this one ha definitely stood out for me i m on the night shift and it s about am i m on the desk now after coming early to help in the restaurant and i m just processing paperwork i hear the door open and i just hear a loud voice exclaim but with your sandwich and instant intrigue hit they come up to the desk and ask if the bar is closed in our hotel the night porter served after the bar staff leave at so technically the bar never close for resident grabbing the key i direct them down to the bar and down we all go now for the fun part we get into conversation a i m pouring them pint of beer and i soon find out the story of what happened with this sandwich these guy have been out in the city and of course when you drink you get hungry they go to a kebab place and order food ordering themselves an uber at the same time they get their food the cab come and get ready to leave it s at this point that the driver tell them they re not allowed to take food in his car the one guy say no problem and get rid of his food but the other guy sneak it into the car and say nothing until they get back to the hotel this is when he pull the sandwich and the fry out of his jacket wave it in the air and give a loud cry along the line of hahaha i had food with me all this time and in the heat of the moment the sandwich and the fry are both launched at the ground by mr drunk in his attempt to stick it to the man it made a huge mess but it wa hilarious all the same turn out we were both big fan of school of rock and it wa at this point i said to the guy he should have got his friend to record it play it over the well you re not hardcore unless you live hardcore and post it to youtube i think mr schneebly would have been proud

i wa running a coffee cart out the back of an existing cafe in a busy corporate part of town business picked up substantially and i wa on my toe all day every day a corporate karen in the line wa talking on the phone and didn t acknowledge my greeting she continued to talk on the phone while i looked at her waiting i said i ll let you finish your call next and gestured to the next in line she finished her call and placed her order i made it promptly she came back five minute later to tell me how rude i wa i told her that her talking on the phone while she s ordering make my job a lot harder another lady in the line congratulated me on sticking up for myself that afternoon i got a call from my bos she d received an email from karen detailing just how rude she thought i wa and what measure she d take to ensure nobody she know go to the cafe i got fired i don t care that i got fired she got the treatment she deserved and i didn t apologise once
today during my one loathed breakfast shift a week a woman flagged me down to complain that her son wouldn t eat his egg because they were too yolky they were scrambled i thought she meant they weren t cooked enough for him but on a glance it wa clear they were totally cooked through so i wa confused i apologized and offered to have them remade this wa apparently deeply offensive to her and she said no and then asked for a takeout box visibly fuming saying they taste too much like yolk once she got it she packed up the offending egg and they stormed out a she muttered about waste of money i get she wa probably looking for a comp but family owned restaurant and the owner policy is only comp if there is actually a mistake on our end and of all the thing to complain about why would you pick scrambled egg containing egg yolk tasting like egg yolk to be fair a remake definietly would not have fixed this problem lol
i think most of u have our fair share of horror story when it come to being oversold and needing to walk someone a couple week ago we were oversold room which is an absolute nightmare that s almost of the total room we have which is insane our revenue department doesn t give a flying fuck about u or our guest a long a we sell out and they get their bonus at end of the year it s not uncommon for them to oversell u indiscriminately so anyway we re oversold room and will need to walk all of them by pm i d already handled walk and wa completely over it i have no patience for getting screamed at for shit entirely out of my control we re expected to just take verbal abuse for this bullshit this guy come in and right away i can tell he s not going to take the news well a soon a he saw the walk letter he knew what wa happening and wa immediately like absolutely not i am staying at this hotel and do not give a fuck about anything you re about to say i try to tell him none of this is in my control and that all i could offer him wa either to accept the walk or cancel his reservation and find his own accommodation he kept saying screaming rather no and that he would be staying here tonight at this point i ve stopped caring about being professional i tell him i am not the person to direct your anger at upper management pushed through your reservation knowing we didn t have a room for you so blame them not me i m just doing my job and have done all i can for you after a few more minute of fighting he took the walk letter and stormed out i thought that wa pretty mild i could ve told him that upper management doesn t give a single shit about him or me which they don t a long a they get their money anyway a week later my gm get a call from our district manager the guest somehow got a hold of his email and complained rightfully about being lied to about his guaranteed reservation of course he brought me up by name saying that i told him that corporate knew he wasn t going to have a room which they did so i got a write up for unprofessional conduct and ripped to piece for telling the guest the truth it s all i could do not to standup and quit right then but i need this job corporate is a joke they want to fuck over their employee and guest but are coward so they won t actually take the blame for it all they care about is money they have these bullshit policy and expect the employee to be robot who don t feel any sense of anger or frustration for being the one who catch the dogshit thrown at u i hate this job

i currently work in a corporate hotel that isnt very fancy and is just outdated but had a reno about year ago we are named a certain way so let s just say for the sake of posting this we are the central location there is another hotel exactly named but ha just one extra word in the name so we will call them central north location welp today i get a call from a lady who asked me if we re marketing two of the same hotel with different name i say well they re the central north location and she start ranting off to me about how confusing it may be for guest i tell her i understand her concern but that wa corporates decision to name our hotel that way well she wa like i dont want to stay at your hotel and quite frankly i m annoyed because of the mix up she told me to call corporate and let them know that it confusing i tell her i just work here a a front desk agent i have no pull to do so and she tell me well then let your manager know and i tell her that we get the same complaint all the time and the manager do know she begin to question me asking me if it s because i dont pas it on to my management it s apparently all my fault lol i hate dealing with most third party reservation
probably a bad way to put that but eh blah blah blah on mobile i typically come in around minute early for work it give me time to use the restroom make sure my hair makeup clothes are alright and prepare myself for jumping into the chaos here lately i ve taken to hanging on in another place up the street before work to minimize how early i come in why because i have a manager that if i come in early no matter how early she ll inform me that s she s sat me with table it s not a lot and i can handle it but i m certainly not expecting it when i accidentally show up minute for a shift i d just hang around outside but she d honestly probably come find me to do something on shift or not admittedly i m willing to hop in if we re busy very busy and at the request of other server especially if dinner rush came early but having people out in my section when i m not even on shift yet is immensely irritating anybody else deal with something like this
my daughter had a birthday party the other night and wa very upset by the attitude of my server and the quality of the food we had to reorder our food because they made it wrong or just didn t want to make it dude the attitude came when you tried to smoke in front of six year old and afterwards when you tipped because we didn t give you a pizza we have never once put pizza on the menu
i m so angry about this entire situation i ve worked at the same hotel for year my gm i ll call him jake and his family managed the hotel they were incredible they took great care of all u employee and treated u like family unfortunately the hotel wa sold by the owner new management kept all the employee but jake and his family were relocating immediately to another hotel across the country jake being the wonderful person he is promoted me to assistant gm before the transition to help me out and give me a good position come to find out it didn t include a pay raise yet i wa so shocked by how sudden everything happened i didn t think to ask any detail the new owner i ll call him ron would also be gm of the hotel my first interaction with ron wa very brief he seemed like a decent guy there are a lot of improvement he want to make which would be great for the property the very next day i have a few barely legible handwritten note to call several place to create new account not just for my hotel but for his other hotel property too i had no idea what sort of service these were nor do i have access to the necessary info ron owns and manages other hotel in town so he isn t always on the property understandable i ve been asking to sit down with him to discus what he expects from me a a new assistant gm and ask what sort of pay raise he thought wa reasonable it took an entire week before ron squeezed in a few minute with me before he had to leave again i barely had time to ask my question about all the new thing he asked me to do he dodged most of it by saying i know you can do it i wa apprehensive but agreed lastly i mentioned that i wa open to discussing a pay raise this is what made my blood boil ron said we ll see how well you perform and we ll discus it in a few month the ball on this guy i said with my recent promotion and all the new responsibility i ve taken on for multiple property you want to wait a few month before i get a raise he said yes you make a pretty good wage i make per hour more than minimum wage if you do well you ll earn a raise i said ok then i immediately submitted my resume to other location not happening he s delusional i hope all you front desk attendant are appreciated for your hard work know your worth and don t let anyone walk all over you
i ve always been somewhat of a believer that people are going to tip the way they tip no matter what unless the service is exceptionally bad by this i mean that if you give the best service possible and still receive those people never planned on tipping more than that in the first place i do still believe that for the most part but tonight wa a little different my restaurant close at i wa the only server and we died especially hard around if it stay that dead closing server will get cut early and it will just be the bartender working bartender let me know before that i d probably be getting cut within the hour but it wa still too early to tell bartender take more table i m unofficially cut at this point wrapping up my last table when a party of walk in just before i don t really want to take it but i do since bartender is a little busy i wa already in about to go home mode so i wa really not feeling it but i took minute to sigh heavily in the closet while the party took their seat once i m done putting myself in the right mind frame i go out and deliver the best service possible the table wa lightweight problematic not too bad but still annoying for someone who wa ready to go home some food wa sent back some sas wa sent my way but i still made sure to deliver the best possible service because if i wa going to get a bad tip i sure wasn t going to blame it on my service one guest asks for the check a they re all finishing up their meal it s about at this time i cash them out then shortly after notice a single on the table a a tip tip bleh but whatever normally at this point i d leave them alone until they left but something in me told me to keep it going i kept their drink refilled made sure the table wa nice and prebussed continued engaging in conversation with them even offered to take a picture of them all together i knew i wa getting a tip i didn t expect any more but i had nothing else to do while i waited for them to leave they finally do leave about minute before closing time and when i go back to finish cleaning up their table extra single were laying on top of the initial bill and i know for a fact it wasn t there before i know this sub is mostly about calling out annoying guest bad experience and this by far wasn t one of my favorite table ever but i guess i learned that in some situation going the extra mile to make your guest feel welcome really can make a difference even if they weren t the easiest table to deal with and even if i hadn t gotten the extra money i think i d still be proud of myself for delivering the best service possible in a situation where i really wasn t feeling up to it just something to consider for anyone who may in the future feel like they don t want to give their all to a table just because they don t expect a full tip

i am the gm of a small bar restaurant tucked away in upper middle class neighborhood we have a ton of regular since the neighborhood is a bunch of older folk with expendable income and young family when i say this place is small i mean it s small seat in the bar for the volume we can crank out especially on weekend well some of my staff get an email for a party on a friday night already people have rsvp d to this party in the restaurant bar without my knowledge or our owner i m pissed and so is my owner how the hell do these people expect u to accommodate them on a friday with no designated space to serve them no notice to bring on extra staff it s not like we have a separate banquet room or anything finally someone from the party call to speak to my never present owner after she tried contacting them so instead being the gm i take the call i speak to the person and try and make it very clear we will need credit card a soon a anything is ordered we have had this issue of folk leaving with substantial tab we have very limited parking i ask for a many people to car pool a possible because it is friday the busiest night of the week i can only reserve one small section for them till our regular dinner service is over then they can migrate and take more table but i cannot sacrifice the experience of other paying customer not apart of this group i also made it clear if they had talked to u before basically forcing our hand we could have done more for them for example if they wanted this party on a monday or tuesday i would have gladly let them have half the bar or more i emphasized this point nicely because only a few people in this group of plan on having dinner of patron in our bar order dinner on top of multiple drink which mean more in sale duh i ask them to please reach out the day before with an approx head count so i know in addition to another server what other staff i should bring in well after all that these people do the most to try and get me in trouble with my bos the owner saying i wa rude snarky and because i wa concerned with other paying customer and not just them they re taking the party elsewhere my bos wa on my side these people while they may be regular they re the worst kind of regular they get drunk loud obnoxious tip like shit and think we owe them something because they come in often my bos and i are a lot a like which can sometimes cause issue but i m glad this time we were both on the same page i am trying to run a business on her behalf

cba with a tl dr sue me last saturday i wa on duty for a hour lunch to close shift at around pm a lone older man come in to eat rather than sit himself down at the table i indicate to him is free he go to the bar instead this in itself wasn t an immediate red flag but something just seemed off about him he wa wearing real scraggy clothes and a worn hat it s not out of the ordinary and like hell am i going to make an issue based on just his clothing i remember after eating his starter and removing his plate i ask him how his food wa and he replied something along the line of i m just praying he cast not so much a glare but a blank stare at me after this and i put the random response down to perhaps the customer having some sort of mental problem not a problem of course it just caught me off guard a bit at the bizarre reply i smiled at him and continued about the night i then see minute later that he s ordered our most expensive dish on the menu this again isn t out of the ordinary but in hindsight this should have immediately been another red flag because minute after his main food arrived he s standing up putting his coat on and leaving he doesn t appear to be in any rush and since he s barely touched his food i assume he s gone out for a cigarette wrong instead i trusted my gut feeling this time and checked the table on the register his bill is still active and not paid for cue me heading out and coaxing him back inside it is when doing this that i realise the guy is totally fucking shit faced he s wobbling around and barely able to stand so i sit him back at the bar where his food is and politely inform him that his bill ha not been paid for cue him insisting he paid with another employee there s me the bartender another waitress and two runner both of whom don t take payment so that leaf either me bartender or waitress a the person he paid with nobody else is on duty right now i ask him politely who between the bartender and waitress he paid with and he go silent he then demand that i prove he didn t pay this is proven after printing his valid bill our system is set up so when you pay for a bill you cannot print it off again without manager approval of course he doesn t believe me and start swearing at both me and the bartender sensing this whole situation is going to go south i decide the best course is to call the police just to add to this a the back and fourthing continued with this guy he demanded a police presence so when the cop arrive i give him one last chance to settle the bill and be on his way he of course instead want to talk with the police bearing in mind throughout all of this i ve been with the guy for almost minute table that have been sat down during this time have been looking at me expectantly to them they probably think i m just standing around doing nothing the police talk to him and basically give him an option of either going to jail that night for petty theft or pay the bill and leave he chooses the latter seriously what the fuck is wrong with these type of people do they honestly believe that the police will automatically side with them because they said so fucking hell
hockey mom dad and their hide and seek playing spawn run for your life hide your kid hide your wife so i come in this evening to a full on hockey mom and dad beer bash in progress with a little girl hiding in my market from boy playing hide and seek not a good look my nd shifter update me on what ha been going on and how needy these guest have been and how she s had to run the kid out of the business center multiple time even though their parent are nearby drinking at one of the lobby table it s like yeah you handle our kid we re busy drinking she come and try to console me and say that she doesn t know how long their going to be out there in the lobby drinking but that hopefully it won t be much longer because they ve been at it awhile lol she s cute huh i quickly clue her in that they ve only just begun and that it ll probably be around am before they start to trickle off one by one to their respective room this is her first time working nd shift and experiencing the hockey brigade soooooo this just happened one of the kid playing hide and seek just plowed into our door it doesn t look a if they are offline but they won t close one of the dad walk over just a i am and inspects the door to see if there wa any damage like i said it doesn t appear to be offline but it wasn t closing so he push it offline and then aligns it again and the door close one of the mom say he fixed it again lol just like last night lol he then throw his arm in the air victoriously and asks me if he can have buck off his bill for fixing the door y all imagine for a moment if i wa boo boo the fool and actually took this proposition seriously and gave him buck off his bill this whole hotel would be done in and fixed with duck tape wood glue and super glue they would unleash their kid on this poor hotel for ultimate destruction so that they could fix it and get money off their bill leading to free night imagine imagine if i wa crazy enough to fall for this well good thing i m not and good thing i didn t take him to be serious we both laughed it off but we also both know that if i had actually considered it a demolition crew of kid would have descended upon this hapless hotel update they re gone i can t believe it they have actually left the lobby and gone to their respective room hold on while i close my mouth that ha fallen open from sheer shock and they only left behind a little bit of trash not whole heaping pile of it this must be a different group than the one that s been here before or someone in the group read this subreddit and have decided to get their act together and for that i say thank you

on mobile sorry i work in an up and coming popular american sport and restaurant place think fancy bowling for over a year now part time whenever we close people check we re able to combine their game ticket with their food ticket so they can pay both at once which is mighty convenient but sometimes some people don t want food and just want to play aka my couple tonight i didn t check on the constantly i did have a table next to them though that we re getting drink so i did glance their way every once and awhile to make sure their equipment wa working properly but overall a very laid back table so laid back that i didn t even pick up their game check under my name nor did i capture a card for them which is company policy but anyway they walked out and even though i didn t even pick up their check i still got written up for it and i m now on a day probation at work people that purposely walk out on tab are the lowest frickin scum cheap ass

for the last week we ve had a lady coming to my hotel location every week for night per visit every time she pay in all cash including her deposit that s required for cash paying guest we ask for either a card to put into a nd folio that doesn t get hold or charge unless they break the reg card they sign or cash deposit that we give back during check out after the room ha been inspected my coworkers and my bos suspect she s a sex worker which isn t legal in my state but we haven t had any hard evidence to consider reporting it yet their reasoning is because she always pay cash only give u a wrong phone number always check in alone but it s clear that someone else ha been in the room with her when housekeeping come to clean the room for the next guest my personal guess is that she s probably cheating and is giving the wrong information so that her so doesn t find out about it she s always checked in on my day off so i ve never seen her until today other then her questionable life choice everything ha been fine up until a couple week ago apparently she did some thing to her room last week and we had a repeat of the same issue again the week before that here is today s visit from her guest hello i d like to rent a room for tonight just use my deposit that i left here from last time for today s stay please me i m sorry ma am i can t do that i wa left note here about your previous stay with u stating that you had left your room smoked in a well a some damage in the room guest what do i look like i smoke to you i don t do any of that stuff quick joking around and just use my deposit that i left here from last week it should be in your drawer she wave her hand in the direction of our cash drawer where we would normally keep our deposit me once again i m sorry but i m not able to do that ma am your previous deposit wa forfeited for the smoking and damage done to the room i m not able to use your deposit again because your deposit is no longer here management took your deposit and used it to deep clean and repair the damage that you caused to your room guest i m tellin you i ain t done no damage to the room and i didn t smoke in it neither just use my deposit again and let me pay for my room me ma am even if that wa the case your deposit isn t here i have no deposit s waiting here for you we don t normally keep deposit here for week on end because you are suppose to come to the front desk to have u inspect your room before we can give you your deposit back but the front desk note state that you kept forgetting them here and when we made attempt to call you so that you can come retrieve your deposit back someone answer the phone and state that you gave u the wrong number and that you don t live with her and for u to remove the number from our system deposit aren t suppose to be carried over for the next visit you re suppose to retrieve it from u a you leave our hotel guest that s clearly a lie coworker know to just leave it in the drawer for me for when i come back every week me that s because coworker can t contact you because you keep giving u the same wrong number she try to reach you in order for you to come get your deposit but since it s the wrong number we are unable to contact you guest well i live outside of town so i just leave my deposit here each time so i don t have to keep doing it just call coworker she know me she ll tell you to do this for me me ma am neither coworker nor i can use your deposit from last week because you smoked and damaged the room both last week and the week before the st time it happened my manager let it slide but you repeated the same damage and smoked in the room again so she had to decline the return of your deposit to use towards fixing the issue guest you keep saying i smoked and damaged the room i already told you i don t smoke what do you guy claim i damaged in the room anyways me well um the note state that both last week and the week before you smoked marijuana and peed the bed during both visit ma am guest what this is ridiculous i didn t piss in no bed me i m sorry but that s what my note state i only have that to go off of i have no more say in the matter guest this is crazy call coworker so she can sort you out and get me checked in me coworker isn t a manager and neither am i so neither of u can do anything else only myboss can decide if she want to return your deposit at this point the deposit is no longer here and so neither myself nor coworker will be able to use it guest well what the hell am i suppose to do then you guy wont sell me a room any more me we can still sell you a room but we won t be able to use your old deposit we aren t suppose to do it that way anyways because then we would be liable if it got misplaced or missing by the time you decided you wanted it back you re suppose to retrieve it during check out after each visit if you want to check into a room today you will have to pay for the room and leave a new deposit with u there is nothing else i can do because it s out of my hand and only the manager can do anything for you guest well when is she coming in i want this sorted out and i m not giving you guy more money for a deposit you re going to give it back to me me she ll be here in the morning from x z hour i don t know if she ll do anything for you because we are technically allowed to charge card just for smoking in the room but since you did cash and most aren t ok with having to pull out in cash we request she s already lost for the smoking and damage from this event so i wouldn t keep your hope up because since you didn t attempt to collect your deposit at check out she can t reexamine the room to see if your claim are valid any more because the room ha since been cleaned and repaired by this time guest well i guess we ll just have to find out and see then now won t we i ll be making sure i call her in the morning make sure she know to expect my call she huff and walk back out the door i guess she decided not to stay lol edit update just came in for my shift and brought the guest up to my bos lady she already knew the short version of yesterday but she said she read my note guest is now on the dnr list so she ll have to take her cheating self out of here and try her shenanigan somewhere else another note apparently this wasn t a nd time but a rd time she s smoked and pissed the bed who doe this shit
i work at a restaurant where we set the table with plate menu napkin and fork there are only table and it s sort of seat yourself we welcome them in ask how many and then tell them to sit anywhere but the big table because were so small but it seems without fail that if the restaurant is mostly empty and there s only one table that s dirty or isn t set up that someone will sit at that table and then stare at me annoyed waiting for me to bring them menu for the love of god if the table isn t set there s probably a reason and you probably shouldn t sit there pick any of the other table that already have menu at them oh also dont take napkin menu plate fork off of the table near you to save u some time you re not saving u any time we will bring you what you need just goddam wait if anything you re disrupting u for later when we direct someone to sit there only to realize we have to drop everything and set the table for them because both of the napkin are gone and there s only one menu what posse people to just take apart table that are already set i don t understand just ask me i ll get it for you
lol nope it not our responsibility or job to let you know which guest aren t allowed here and for what reason you should know or have better judgment on who you let in your room you think some rude tweakers who have been kicked out before aren t trouble for u ok lol we already told them to leave once but yet they came back to you again yeah i am sure those sketchy tweakers are there to help you move stuff in the middle of the night why do these idiot think we were born yesterday and will buy their b story sorry but ya gots to check out by am no exception on our policy

i work in a very busy restaurant which ha me working hour without a break i recently noticed that our payroll manager ha secretly and manually clocked me and other serve staff in and out for min meal break that we never get to take nor allowed to take sometime last year they forced u to sign a meal break policy in which we could reserve the right to take a meal break however i wa always under the impression that if we do choose to waive our min meal break on an hr shift the state of california enforces the company to pay some type of time and half to the individual who don t break i m pretty sure it s illegal for them to manually clock u in and out for break without our consent but i m assuming by them doing so is to avoid any sort of compensation pay for not breaking what are my legal right and who should i talk to in regard to my right in this situation

i work night audit at a canadian hotel i had a walk in around pm and specifically asked how many people before i quoted him a price he said it wa just him i wa a little leery i should have listened to my spider sense i put him in a room in the corner that did not have anybody else beside him at just before am a girl come in looking real slutty and i figured she wa just at the bar he come down and they go up together and i thought great he got a call girl ten minute later she come down alone and asks if she can wait for her ride i said a long a it won t take long she rolled her eye at me i did not care she left and he came down at am and when i let him in i noticed after i let him in the door that he had a different girl with him this one did not look like a bar girl she definitely wa a prostitute i thought fuck he is a pimp anyways i go do my floor check and there is no noise from that area a long a there are not more people and it stay quiet i don t care fast forward to am and now another chick that look like a prostitute is trying to get in i ask for room number and she tell me it the room with our pimp i said no he had enough guest tonight so he come down and i call him over to the desk before he let her in i tell the pimp i registered you a one guest to the room i have seen at least three others it wa actually two but that is besides the point there are no more guest coming to your room today he wa commenting on he rented the room and he can do with it a he plea i told him no i specifically asked how many people for the room and i let the others slide it is past in the morning if you want to take them somewhere you are more than welcome to check out and stay somewhere else he said it late i cannot get a room elsewhere i replied that s your choice nobody else is coming in and out of the hotel the pimp smirk or what are you going to do a he step one step closer to the front door to let his prostitute in i reply i will evict you in the process he smirk even bigger and who is going to evict me in which i replied the police and if you don t go to your room now i will be calling them and they will be interested in our video footage and gladly take your information that i gathered from your id the smirk fell off his face and he waived his prostitute away he turned around and just went to his room then he left with all his stuff edit the amount of people in this post that talk about policing my guest is ridiculous and i have never heard of that need some common sense first of all if you are having friend over they will typically come together not one at a time and only see you for minute second when asked how many people in the room you would typically say i have some friend coming unless you are drunk or high and going to cause noise problem or up to something third they would not be coming in at all hour of the morning and if they were coming in after the bar they should be coming in with you a they are unregistered guest lastly if you were a disrespectful idiot and had your friend come in one at a time all hour in the morning then yes you should be refused entry even if the room isn t loud closing and opening the door make noise a doe chatting in the hallway which is exactly what would happen if you had drunk friend come in have some respect for all patron staying at a hotel and don t be so entitled
hey y all short time lurker first time poster took me a minute to figure out how to get my karma up so i could share some of my own fd story i work at a small hotel in a quaint all american town in a southern state i can count how many room we have with my finger and toe we don t give our guest those plastic card you swipe to get into your room each guest ha a personal code that we usually give based off of their phone number i wa working second shift and i recall it being fairly busy that evening in the lobby because we also have a bar at our hotel i remember checking in some businessman go about the check in process and house rule give him his code card and send him on his way not too long afterward the guest come down and tell me he just realized he had gone into the wrong suite he said well my code worked and everything and i m already settled in so i m not moving i wa still fairly new so i just said okay and asked if he knew the room number that he had gone into long story short he basically gave himself a free upgrade and there wasn t a thing i could do about it thankfully there wasn t already another guest in that suite so i let it go so that s my short story about how a guest got a free upgrade at our hotel and a lesson for me and any other new fda i train because i now know how to go through and clear all of the old code from the door to avoid this situation again in the future also i don t think that guest wa difficult at all so it turned out to not be a big deal

year ago in the s i wa the front office supervisor at a fancy dt hotel of a well known brand that rhyme with schmilton one evening i had a young australian couple approach me at the desk and ask to exchange some currency i asked for their room number so i could log the transaction on the room but they said they were not guest in the hotel despite being a five star hotel we were just around the corner from a youth hostel where they were staying they had been backpacking around canada for the past month and were flying home the next day but they had run out of canadian money they needed a small amount of cash to eat that evening and take the airport shuttle early the next morning i told them currency exchange wa a service we only provided to guest of the hotel a it turned out they wanted to trade au dollar were not even on our supported currency list we only did usd pound sterling and few others the couple were very pleasant and understanding and thanked me for my time then moved to the other side of the lobby from the desk a i finished checking in another guest i glanced over and saw the couple wa still there they were standing embraced and i could see the lady wa cry the man wa stroking her hair and consoling her i immediately felt bad for them and i didn t want the last memory of their awesome trip to be going hungry i went out to them and asked them to wait minute for me i went behind the desk to the front office where the gm s office wa i knew he got several financially oriented newspaper each day and in one of them i wa able to find the exchange rate for au usd and canadian and by doing some math work out the au to cdn rate this wa in the day before the internet i added to ensure our fee would be covered and then i exchanged for them i think they got about buck enough for supper breakfast and airport shuttle ticket the couple were extremely appreciative the young lady hugged me and wanted to tip me out of the fund but i politely refused the gentleman shook my hand and thanked me repeatedly i wished them safe travel and we parted way when i returned to the desk my colleague noted that my action were very generous but i would probably get in trouble for it i had a bit of a reputation for painting outside of the line our comptroller at the time wa a chinese lady who wa brought up in england she wa a c u next tuesday who ruled accounting with an iron fist she and i butted head on a number of occasion usually when a fda would commit a minor accounting error she d want them written up and i would have to defend them when i cashed out at shift end i naturally didn t balance so i wrote a note about the manual transaction and attached it to the au dollar i had my day off after that then worked the weekend so by the time i got in on monday i had forgotten about the incident completely a couple minute into my shift the fom called me to his office and when i got there he hr and the comptroller were waiting for me uh oh she wa fucking livid seriously choked that i had misused hotel fund and set a bad example and broken rule i asked which rule she didn t have an answer to that and it just set her off on another rant i told her the couple just wanted to eat where is the harm it that she screamed at me that s not our problem out of the corner of my eye i saw the fom signalling to stand down he and i were good friend outside of work we drank and rode motorcycle together so i took the hint and shut my mouth she wanted me fired on the spot the fom asked me to go a wait in my office a couple door down while they discussed it anxious minute later the fom called me back to his office the comptroller wa not there just him and the hr douchebag hr wa a wanker with no backbone who never stood up for employee they said they had talked her out of firing me and settled on a written warning and a day suspension hr db handled the paperwork and i refused to sign the warning i told them it wa bullshit my fom buddy agreed but his hand were tied he did however arrange for the suspension to coincide with both my day off and a stat holiday so i actually got almost a week off he also owed me about hr for some double shift i had pulled a few week earlier when we were temporarily short staffed so i didn t lose any pay either the comptroller didn t see me for a week and on my first day back she had a smug look on her face but i had my own smug look because i just had an all expense paid mini vacation paid for by her about a month later i wa called into a dept head meeting not a regular occurrence but happened from time to time there in front off all the dept head including psycho comptroller the gm recognizes me a the national recipient for that quarter of the schmilton s promise award which come with a plaque a letter from corporate and a cheque for the promise award recognized employee who went out of their way to create memorable guest experience in unique and innovative way a i found out later the australian couple upon returning home had written a glowing letter about me to head office about how my act of kindness had helped them it won me the award even though they weren t actually guest the only time that happened during the year duration of the global promotion the next day i went to hr and asked the hr db to remove the written warning but predictably he refused a couple of day later it appeared in my inbox torn into quarter my fom buddy pulled it for me a i wa enjoying golden boy status at the time i figured i d push my luck and put the scrap in the comptroller s inbox almost got written up for that one too

service rep i ve ever met me me the narrator taking you on this lovely trip through memory lane i m mostly a secondary character in the event of this half a i could no longer subject myself to di s orthodox interrogation method a long time ago in a hotel far far away i angered the hospitality god and they sought retribution in the form of the world greatest detective from here on out known a detective idiot di wa like any other guest before the god decided we should share a special moment in hospitality guest relation i did not check him in and he wa just a name and a room number until he needed something because of course he did we rejoin our protagonist me behind the front desk trying to wrap my head around the event of the last minute and where it all went wrong my coworker can now see the dread on my face after being lectured about design choice i had no part in deciding if a lightswitch ever ha any bearing on how your day go understand you ve lost pack it up and try again tomorrow unfortunately i still had about hour left on my shift a payback for the many prank and goof i ve pulled during my time there my coworker decides to try and make light of the situation after i ve finished explaining what just happened the phone ring and they answer hey funburgers it that guy again he want to switch back to his original room i whip the key in my hand at the wall out of frustration and they stick into the wallpaper me fuck you that s not funny no seriously he said since the light are working he want to move back queue a littany of profanity and internalized screaming my frustration had hit it boiling point i refuse to deal with this man and insist my coworker head up to deal with him and his eternal wisdom im met with a reply of oh come on he cant be that bad give it five minute i have a strange quirk that the more bothered i am the more pleasant and helpful i am to the next guest a few check in arrive and my coworker still hasn t returned some minute later from what should ve been a simple key swap part of me want to laugh part of me want to cry knowing what i just subjected them to but we are nothing if not professional br notice a line of people at the desk a i m working my way through getting them all checked in and walk over to welcome the guest and smooth the process over after the line ha been cleared br asks me where coworker is they know me too well by this point and can hear in my voice when somethings up oh they re upstairs helping a guest move room innocentface jpeg br damn they ve been gone for like minute oh i know i proceed to explain some of what just transpired when coworker reappears from the elevator looking like the vietnam flashback dog br begin laughing after seeing both of our face not to worry br s time would soon come for none shall be spared on this night coworker begin explaining how di grilled them on the lightswitch being supposedly upside down i generally like to believe in scenario like this if you don t laugh you re gonna cry there is neither only pain and frustration with both of our mood soured we head to the back to angrily delve into our phone in the hope of forgetting di s existence if only for a short time why can t he just accept that objectively the light work why doe it matter what direction the switch is facing if it indeed turn the light on im gonna find whoever let him book here and i swear to god how much time ha passed since i started angrily scrolling reddit the next thing i know i hear cackling at the front desk the type of laughter that can only be conceived by monty python level of absurdity however much time ha passed while my coworker and i sought relief in our bomb shelter ha given di time to move about the complex he made his way towards the door that lead outside but fate would throw yet another obstacle in his path there are many door that go outside of this property two in particular lead towards the patio due to whatever ingenious lawmaker decided you re allowed to drink outside so long a the area is fenced in we in fact have a patio di attempted to make his way to his car and stumbled upon these magnificent door only to be stumped in fact there wa a three foot railing blocking his path to freedom and combustible engine i ve hopped this fence many time but perhaps that is the arrogance of youth br being a shining light of customer service walked over to greet di and inform him of the nearest door that would lead to his destination a fatal mistake for all would feel the wrath of di br sir were you headed to the parking lot di yes i m trying to get to my car but there s a fence br i m sorry sir those door lead to the patio there s another door that lead to the parking lot down the hall that s closer to where you re parked di what you people are doing here is criminal what if there s a fire everyone in here is gonna die the sign clearly say exit upon hearing br relay this interaction i cannot contain my laughter i m belly laughing like i m at a mitch hedberg show tear stream down my face a i lose all control my coworker is handling a guest and asks me to come to the front and fulfill their request a i attempt to regain composure the guest can t help but also laugh and ask what s going on if you only knew
i m hopefully finally leaving the host trap yes i agreed to be hired a a host almost a year ago for restaurant experience a it made sense and i believed it would set me up for success i ve been working at the same place for a while and have learned to navigate the po put out fire compartmentalize and so much more i learned what the food looked like arrived to work on time every day with a great attitude i ve practiced carrying thing on a tray and helped my coworkers out between then and now it s been i need someone with experience when another host wa promoted without experience another outside serving hire came and went and i wa still busting my as you don t have enough menu knowledge so i studied the menu even more and got a much of a grasp a i could without being able to see all of the item another hire this time a girl who wa hired many month ago a a host who flaked out and bailed on the job is now back training to serve me i ll get a promotion whenever we hire another host meanwhile one server i ve seen take a sip of wine before serving it yes in the same glass and eat off of plate before serving them i have my first training shift at another tiny restaurant with the exact same cuisine a the place i work now in a few day tiny busy place no section it ll be an ideal start best part no freaking host stand to hold me back just waiting to see how thing go so i can put the final nail in the coffin and quit this place that ha fucked me over wish me luck i ve thankfully been paying attention at my job and not just dicking around like others i told myself and my coworkers i would be leaving the host life in hoping this is it for me
i work at a fairly new opened in august small restaurant a a server on weekend and a bartender server when i work alone during the week monday thursday we only have one person on for each shift and then my coworker one of the two usual bartender worked the dinner shift by himself on tuesday night and i had to work the lunch shift on wednesday morning he left the bar spotless but left the dining room floor a mess and i ll tell you right now we weren t busy enough for him to claim he didn t have time to sweep this isn t the first time this ha happened the last time i came in after this bartender he didn t sweep the floor left the table unbussed and unset didn t wipe the leather sofa down etc basically didn t clean up at all in the dining room my bos said that he wa busy and alone so she just barely helped me clean up after him and he knew i wa covering his shift so he could go out with his friend which make this even worse because i wa doing him a favor so today even though all he did wa not sweep the floor i wa furious again she defended him and said he wa there alone there s another bartender who work here and i never have this problem the dining room is usually fine and i don t mind setting a few table because we usually don t have all of the necessary silverware to fully set the table at the end of the night i told her he should be sweeping the floor and that he shouldn t be working there alone if he can t do that before he leaf she said we can t afford to have more than one person on during the week i said i don t care we don t leave the dining room a mess like that that s not how we do thing and that wa the end of the conversation maybe i m a jerk for the attitude i gave her but i m just fed up at this point later on she say that the cook forgot to prepare something so i had to tell a customer that we couldn t make something that they ordered off of our menu and she go see that s something to get mad about my personal opinion is that no one should leave the restaurant until it is clean and that the opener should be able to pull the chair down and do the normal setting up that is required and open the door i don t think the opener should be required to clean up after the person who closed it piss me off that my bos can t just make it a requirement that this bartender should not be leaving the restaurant until it is the way they came in clean i am sometimes there until in the morning when i get off at because table are there late and i have to clean up i would never leave a messy dining room we have a year old man who claim they don t know how to sweep another server who only work on saturday night the busiest night of the week every week which is another issue i have another guy who just doesn t sweep and lie and say he doesn t know how when he is asked to sweep and complains when he ha to mop or do anything else everyone else just want to make money and leave that s not how the restaurant business work when i have said something in the past my bos said what do you want me to do punish them yes actually i do i don t blame them i blame you for letting them get away with these thing and making it okay get it together stop feeling bad for people stop letting people walk all over you stop being a pushover or don t own a restaurant i can think of many restaurant in the area that wouldn t even tolerate this and would fire them for acting like that i m tired of being taken advantage of i m the only one who clean without question it s frustrating if it weren t dead season in the area that i work right now i d go apply somewhere else she s going to lose all of her hardworking employee not just me if she keep this up
so i wa working tonight and everything wa going smoothly i go to a top table of guy and a couple girl right off the bat they start requesting bottle service and a bottle of wine and some food to which i wa happy to oblige they all got pretty drunk and even more people came to the table to have drink they racked up a dollar bill including my gratuity i got a few more table while they were drinking and having a good time i go to talk to some table for a bit and go in back to check on some food and when i came back they were gone i wa dumbfounded a these people were buying quite expensive menu item and drink and gave off a wealthy vibe if that s the correct term i immediately ran upstairs to see if they were getting more stuff at the bar i checked all over the restaurant for them nowhere to be seen i let my manager know about the situation and then he notifies the owner bos i got a stern talking to about it which i deserved for being negligent and not keeping a close eye on this high bill table anyways the night go on and i catch word that someone found out that the guy were going to a night club not too far away downtown the owner manager then go to saud night club and make them pay for the bill in full including the gratuity the bill is then closed out under my other manager name a an open bar tab with no gratuity but the total wa still charged the owner talked to me at the end of the night saying how he wa about to fire me i got written up for it which i understand basically i am coming to you fellow server and bartender for advice should i accept this dollar loss and move on and forget about it should i mention that i want my gratuity money from the tab i don t want him getting more upset with me for asking but i also think i deserve the money for working my as off maybe i don t i really don t know and could use some help here edit sorry i don t know how to correctly format in mobile i tried my best thanks in advance for any advice
the hotel is full more room to go a dude arrives i check the id no reservation on that name he say that x made the reservation for him and his collegues are here too true and the reservation is until friday oh fair enough it all match i have a reservation on x s name and we collaborate a lot with that company oh no no hour later people enter the hotel turn out they had reservation so i had to call to the other hotel nextdoor to move a person there even though they male could have stayed in the same room never ever trusting the client ever again coincidence suck overbooking suck i feel horrible i will probably have to pay for this but more awful is the fact that the moved client is angry and he will be sure to talk to the manager i also had to offer my credit card information because that client refused fml
a acknowledge your server or b ignore your server and just continue talking a if you and the person you re in a conversation with are the only one in the entire restaurant because i had a table tonight who just would not stop talking to each other even when i said pardon me for the interruption when i wa prebussing the last of their dish away i asked them a i wa clearing their dish would you like to order any dessert tonight and they just kept on fucking talking a if i didn t exist they only stopped talking long enough second to say yes you may take these away but then they launched right back into their conversation because of that i thought they didn t want dessert when i asked them the first time but lo and behold they did want dessert likewise if your server check on you and asks if everything is ok but you want the check do you a say everything is great and not ask for the check because you think your server is a mind reader and then just stare into space or b verbally ask for the check once again had customer be a first time i noticed them staring into space i asked them if everything wa ok they said everything wa great minute later i hear my coworker ask them the same thing same answer apparently they were ready for their check but instead of actually telling me they were ready for the check they expected me to read their mind one of them still had most of their dish unfinished so how wa i supposed to know they were ready for the check if they don t communicate it to me like if your server check on you please actually say you re ready for the check if you re ready to pay because i thought they were just eating their meal very slowly like some customer do

hello this is my very first post on here so it kinda long but bare with me guy amp x b amp x b amp x b i come into my shift a always and follow up with first shift on any important note since it wa sunday one of a slower day all she had to tell me wa that a guest who wa supposed to checkout extended their stay and paid cash and when we have guest pay cash we also require a cash deposit for incidental so that s good to know just in case they decide to checkout early and that wa pretty much it mind you my co worker ha been working for the company for about year right ahead of me myself going on year in august anyways i say that to say that we don t make many if not any mistake compared to newer employee amp x b fast forward after st shift left and about an hour into my shift go by and the lady who extended her stay come down and slapped her purse on the counter and proceeded to say she feel like my colleague gipped her out her change even tho checkout wa at noon and if you extended you stay and key it would be around that time since key erase after noon on departure day so your kinda late but ok so already being a little skeptical but being me i immediately became concerned a you should being the main line of contact and the only one there at the time plus that s just common customer service my exact word were and are you sure you looked in all area of your purse because that s not like my coworker shes been working here for year and ha never had any occurrence of that nature but i will reach out to her for more detail i m thinking and hoping it just a misunderstanding and a soon a i said that the guest flipped shit and started screeching yelling are you kidding me so you think i m making this up you think i m lying and that i m a psycho i know what the f i had and it not there now so she took it i assured her that wa not the case at all and if it wa i wouldn t entertain the issue further than i had i then said in a stern voice in every situation of something coming up missing with lack of evidence there is always more than one possibility that doesn t mean i assume otherwise it just mean i want to see the issue through thoroughly and exhaustively especially dealing with such a potential security risk long story short she walked away upset and i called my coworker not once but twice and i m glad she didn t answer both time but almost and half hour go by and the guest call down to tell me you guessed it she found the money in her purse in a front zipper pocket ugh but she apologized but in a very condescending way tbh but luckily i m good at pretending so i just said the favorite line oh you re fine line and left it at that i m really good at handling angry customer but i cant believe how fast this one wanted to make an issue my coworker ended up calling me back right before i wa about to get off and told me that the guest is actually homeless at the moment and i felt like more empathy for her but you should never go off on someone who s trying to help you what did i say wrong wa i supposed to trash my coworker and be like oh my gosh really she stole a piece of my gum one time too so i bet she did like no

foreign traveler are always a great source of hilarity and a nice opportunity to show off how friendly american can be and boy do i get a lot of them in my experience they re often some of the happiest customer because they re excited by the bright light of a new city destination and enjoying their overseas vacation the hilarity come from trying to cross language and cultural barrier that when combined make the whole interaction a little like two baby playing together i don t get you you don t get me we re still having a good time for example twice last night i had the exchange of how are we doing tonight um pepsi cool i m doing pretty pepsi myself the main thing these interaction involve is a lot of pointing i ask would you like another beer and point to the empty pint they only order thing with picture so they can just point to the picture they want to order a soda and i flip them to the right page and point to the list of brand name they ll recognize barely any english no big deal we re doing this whole thing pre k style i keep my question very simple to avoid confusion when would everyone like water get blank stare i just say water yes and they get me when i know that s the level i stick to pointing and good or more or finished they give me a big smile and declare yes finished and we ve understood each other i always start with the assumption that they speak fluent english and dial it back until communication is achieved a lot of time the kid are better than the parent and we have a little translation moment out of respect i always make eye contact with the parent and speak directly to them but when their teenager step up like a pro it make my job easy love those kid little bilingual rockstars then at the end of the meal they have to try and figure out tipping some of them are experienced at it and have no issue some of them will just hand over their card say a number like and i have to run their card for the actual check amount and then show them the tip line some of them get that part but can t read that they need to sign it it s a little adventure but i like getting to show them so now they can eat at american restaurant and know exactly how to do it like the cosmopolitan world traveler they are at the end of the day i know it s scary to try and go out in a country where you don t really know the language it can be embarrassing to have to speak in very simple term because that s all you know my job a a server to guest from around the globe is to make the experience a fun and easy a possible and i know i ve succeeded when it s all smile when the check come don t worry we re in this together to all of my foreign guest out there welcome to the usa from your server

hello pal i m more of a lurker and occasional commenter and this is my first time posting here so forgive me if my formatting is off at all this happened over last summer when i worked for a small but established fine dining italian restaurant open dinnertime and they hold event during the day and also offer catering clientele wa a you can imagine old rich and white most of our regular and we mostly served regular were some of the best and kindest people i ve ever met and were a real pleasure to work for except this guy and his wife which i would learn about later on i wa fairly new to the restaurant biz had only been working for a couple month at this point i wa recruited along with one other server to do my very first catering job they had their own food they just wanted a couple server to help out and impress they re guest i assume we don t typically do that but because he wa a loyal regular it wa agreed to a a favor not a free favor we still got paid the home wa lovely and a very clear sign they had money so initially i wa ready to kiss some as for tip we came in all black considering that is uniform and we weren t told to do otherwise that s when the wife in all of her stiff plastic glory she wa a fan of cosmetic procedure told u the party would be held outside in degree weather and that she would lend u a couple of her own white shirt she lead my coworker beth and i up to her massive closet and while she wa rifling through her shirt we noticed the excessive t and maga hat everywhere i wa glad the wife s back wa turned because beth could not hide the shock and disdain on her face upon seeing them beth and her husband are hardcore passionate liberal and have a lot of hatred for our current president i suppressed a giggle a wife handed u the shirt and lead u into another room to change after we changed we went downstairs to be ordered around this is where the fun begin right off the bat they treated me a brown girl of differently than beth a white woman of her s i wa addressed a you or young lady half the time and they had me running around doing all the grunt work while beth wa basically being treated almost like a guest i didn t really think too much of it at the time i wa just trying to make some money however i did start to get annoyed when the husband would over explain little thing to me in a way that you would teach a young clueless child such a opening a bottle of wine i worked in fine dining we served a lot of wine what make you think i don t know how to do something this simple instead i just observe and nod my head obediently not wanting to give my bos a bad reputation the wife wa a nightmare for whatever reason she had decided to put the food out about an hour before guest arrived gross but okay whatever she literally had me standing there with an electric fly swatter for a majority of the time trying to swat away fly at one point she yell at me from across the yard in front of the entire party are you even trying to kill these damn fly to be honest i didn t say anything although i wish i had just kind of side eyed her we re fucking outside there s bound to be bug flying around your under cooked salmon not to mention there s nowhere for me to like corner them and kill them i guess i should known better than to leave my go go gadget arm at home my fucking fault anyway fast forward to pm when we finally get to leave the party had migrated inside for dessert i had come downstairs after changing and grabbing my thing saw beth speaking to the husband and collecting our envelope with our sweet sweet moolah inside and start to head over i wa stopped by a skinny middle aged man with an earring dangling from his ear who reminded me of a bootleg joe rodhe the following dialogue ensues joe i heard your name wa maria he had made a clear effort to roll his r in order to impress the brown girl who by the way isn t even fluent in spanish i looked at him shocked and said excuse me and he repeat himself me no my name is insert name i have an r in my name and made it a point to enunciate it very hard to emphasize the fact that i do indeed speaky the engrish can i help you joe oh well insert my name where are you from me i m from town name joe oh i ve never heard of town name what country is that me going from shock to obvious annoyance it s like two town over i m american sir joe no no that s not what i m asking you you re heritage like where are your parent from me well my mom is puerto rican and my dad is cambodian why joe oh well you look so exotic i just had to know you know i m from so and so myself and blah blah blah he proceeded to tell me all about whatever european country his family wa from and i wa just looking at him not listening just waiting for him to be done his friend chime in a bootleg jack black with glass who had been standing there listening the entire time then proceeded to tell me about all the work he did in the capital city back in the s called project la viva cringe which apparently somehow helped inner city puerto rican s out significantly good for you i m sure you feel real good about yourself for helping out the poor brown people year ago what that doe for me and why he expected me to be impressed i have no clue i m pretty sure i just responded with a flat cool i grew up an hour away from the city in a nice suburban town finally husband pull me away and hand me an envelope meant for me with my name incorrect at least he didn t put maria and sends u on his way we each received for hour which i wa happy about in the car on our way back to our restaurant beth had pointed out how they had treated u differently and how it really frustrated her which wa when i had told her about my encounter with the bootleg twin i wa still processing everything a i told her and hadn t realized just how inherently ignorant these men had been towards me she wa enraged more so than i wa at that moment and wa going off the entire ride about how if she had overhead she would have said something and how she knew once she saw the maga hat everywhere that there would be problem back at the restaurant she had me tell everyone the story including the owner who never did the couple any favor ever again that s when everyone told me how much they can t stand them how entitled they are one of the server even told me that one night while serving them the table next to her tipped half their bill and left a note on the receipt saying how sorry they were that she had to deal with the asshole couple i felt a lot better after hearing everyone s and even the owner complaint against them and appreciated how supportive everyone wa upon hearing my story moral of the story please don t assume that the young brown server with slanty eye s name is maria

last night i wa working my side gig when i had a table of i also bartend full time at another spot but money right not super needy but definitely some dietary restriction and preference two of the group left prior to the rest closing out so one guy went ahead and paid the whole tab which came out to just shy of a i m bussing their table i see the slip ha only been signed no tip but dude left his key i take the key to my bar manager and finish resetting the table guy come back in a few minute later and i had showed my manager the receipt when i gave her the key so i knew she wanted to talk to him i direct him to her and keep working on closing stuff she asked him about my service seeing a there wa no tip he stumbled over his word but basically tried to blame his group saying they didnt leave him enough to cover the bill and the tip she told him they were welcome back but her staff work very hard and to please keep that in mind next time and tip appropriately a few minute later i m closing out my last table and the year old who had one beer on special and a bowl of fry left me on honestly that from a young kid that wa obviously on a budget meant more to me than if the other table had actually tipped appropriately so basically shout out to good manager and shout out to that young guy

super long courtesy tl dr at the end relevant post for those that aren t following or more likely have forgotten because it s the internet and also it s been a while let s jump in i applied and interviewed for the new property opening and wa offered the job told our new management company but also let them know that i wouldn t be leaving until the beginning of february well that is today i gave a day notice at the beginning of january i wa only doing week but they offered me a slight raise to give them a full month to ensure the proper training of the new general manager the last few

allowed me to mingle with a lot of the corporate folk a they come in and out i ve also been conducting interview for my new employee a well a the one who are coming with me and having that going on ha been exhausting luckily it wa a slower than usual season for u with occupancy dropping to low double digit more than a few time so being in two place wa easy enough most of the time i checked it wasn t because there wa no one coming in and our poor hotel is getting to the point where the need for a remodel is somehow more obvious than before our staff still get amazing review pretty regularly but when the slower season come and people can pick other property for the same price they re going to go for it you don t go out of town to a hotel that look like your grandma s living room unless that s your thing unless option are limited i m only taking a handful of staff some couldn t go because of the farther travel some just didn t want to risk it etc i respect their choice and some of those people mostly in support staff have been there since before the last time the hotel wa sold in so they re happy enough where they are my agm is coming along with my sale manager and my head housekeeper yeah i m robbing department head they re very good it s why i want them there are some in house promotion going on and of course some outside hire we ve had department head in training for week with sale and my replacement in training for the last month in a super fun twist i have recently begun to date one of my employee a fda not in a scandalous way or anything because of my position i am not allowed to date anyone in the building a our fairly standard company policy on that say you cannot be involved with someone who report to you since everyone report to me you know where this is going this girl however ha worked there for a while when i hired her i wa in a pretty serious relationship that unfortunately ended and blah blah but suffice to say i wasn t looking for anyone i d had my rebound and wa now just mostly focusing on prepping for the interview for my new job a i knew there would be several round anywho i tell you this because this girl wa my pick to take over the fom position after the current fom moved to agm the two are unrelated because she wa already my first choice when i had been thinking about who i d want to take and who not i never considered taking her because there wasn t a manager slot available after i filled agm and sale and corporate filled maintenance restaurant and front office and moving from a position to the same one but without knowing most of your co worker isn t super appealing no we didn t get together until i d made my pick and promoted her her move to front office manager ha put her in considerably closer proximity to me and with greater frequency normally i d just ignore it but since i wa getting ready to leave why not no one know a to prevent anyone from claiming favoritism we are never alone together nor do we ever arrive or leave together i m now making up story of the shenanigan i got into when single dinner party gone awry that sort of thing just to keep up appearance my replacement is a pretty cool dude i actually know him decently well he used to run a property a couple mile down the street from mine and let me tell you he kept that place running for year while god himself tried to smite it next to the busiest freeway off ramp which had a solid dozen panhandler on either side of it across the street from the scariest fucking i ve ever seen with more junky than overcooked roller dog hanging out there block away not one but two catholic charity shelter it wa rough it s amazing how quickly the neighborhood change downtown i drive by it on my way to work every day and i ve seen that guy literally putting out a fire and after all that he kept it running and nearly full without having too many murder eventually someone finally saw fit to just shut that place down it wa still losing money one of my recent housekeeper hire came from there and she said he is pretty cool vastly different management style but that s perfectly fine i tell all of you this boring and kind of convoluted story for a couple reason figured since i d already done two part might a well make it a trilogy the other reason is i know some of the other manager at the airport property and from what i understand because of the location of the airport they don t have any of the problem we do in downtown no people chasing their front desk employee no siren every time there s an incident at a nearby bar without that stuff i won t have much else to write about combine that with the fact that this is a much larger hotel which responsibility i did not have before amenity that don t exist at my current hotel i m probably not going to be working the desk very often anymore i m gonna try but i m pretty picky about what snowflake meltdown story i think are worth telling so aside from crew nightmare i might not have many story worth telling i ll still be reading all of yours oh and the last thing because it s not a day in my hotel if one system isn t in catastrophic failure our phone system i have begged both the former and current management company about redoing the phone system it s old the phone barely work and it s been randomly just dying for hour on end the silence is nice until it finally came back on it wa installed when the hotel wa built in and ha not been updated since i ve just been told it s too expensive with the cost to redo it ranging from k to k i have no idea if that s true but it s the most answer i got well today it died completely could not be resurrected on my last day i did what i could today but it s now the new gm s problem he ll be fine probs soooo that s it the hotel open march first we re down to our opening day but the new employer are giving everyone who ha been working for the past several month and week in the case of the management hire who have been working with me a week off right before the opening to relax which is just super awesome because i am tired tl dr got new job in better location in brand new building i prepare to be a lot busier and my old building give me the finger on my last day

just need to vent apology in advance for the rant i work for a few branch of our municipal government in a few different building i have a main pay rate visitor service and three other pay rate depending on the job assigned av tech v bartender v building supervisor it came time for my yearly review with my main supervisor she had a lot of good thing to say and some thing for me to improve on i tend to get real snotty with rude customer but i don t think we should endure abuse to keep one creep coming back and talking about my duty within my job title over the year i have worked i have picked up varies bitch duty thing salaried folk hate doing but need to be done and usually very boring some of these i ve picked up because i m bored and request busy work or because my bos think i can handle them i am one of the few people who ha no fear of microsoft suite or technology some i do like doing because they keep me busy and some i absolutely hate because the salaried people i am doing it for will not help me in the slightest and it s always my fault when it s incorrect i should also mention that i am the youngest person f at my main site but not at the other branch i work at occasionally everyone else is retired or semi retired and have no issue sitting at the main desk doing nothing for hour my add brain just can t handle it so i am of in visitor service who do bitch duty now our state ha raised minimum wage and so all my job received a small pay bump to keep them competitive but visitor service is only going to the new minimum wage plus cent a my bos want to show how much we all mean to her i could easily go work at a big box store and make more per hour starting but i digress when i pointed out all the extra work i do supplementing all these salaried employee work why can t my main job get a bigger bump my bos just shrug and say that it all part of the other duty assigned and should negotiate before agreeing to take on new work i m pretty bummed right now pretty peeved too since i know that the salaried people got big pay bump and get all the fun of benefit and time off while i do their work i have spent the rest of my shift on reddit or searching for a new job on my phone
i still remember you you came in during a saturday lunch rush to my relatively high class restaurant you didn t have a reservation and you still expected to be the center of my universe despite the other table i wa obligated to give decent service to you flagged me down every single time i passed your table for one thing or another and i wa okay with running in order to meet most of your unrealistic demand then you stopped me short you had already taken up minute of my time you had only taken maybe sip of your coke you barely looked me in the eye a you lazily gestured towards your drink i need a fresh coke now i don t know if you re truly a sadistic person or you re just incredibly stupid i take your glass and dump it out for a fresh coke naively i thought that wa the end of it lo and behold not minute later and a barely touched glass you need another one another minute and you re asking for a third what is wrong with the coke you won t be direct and tell me so the next time you asked for a fresh one i got a little vindictive i m not proud of what i did but it wa still amusing to see the disgust on your face i grabbed you a full carafe of fresh coke and brought it directly to you if you need a refill you can do it yourself if you need fresh coke congratulation shove a straw in it
it wasn t completely burned all the way down but damn near i got a call from my co worker cry saying someone called her and said where we work wa on fire i ve been there seven year my aunt and uncle worked their ass off for that place to keep it running since i grew up there i remember going with my aunt to drop off her application without that damned place my aunt would ve never met my uncle we have a pretty good sized staff over and now me and even entire family are without work some of our wait staff a worked there over year my initial are carved into the swinging kitchen door the house we built is burning
so my old restaurant i used to work at specifically said we don t take reservation only call aheads for those that don t know a reservation dictate that if you show up on time you ll be seated at that that time a call ahead mean that you get priority over walk in but there can still be a few minute where you re not seated right away say give u a minute leeway lately going out to fine dining restaurant we ll get there and they ll say there s still a minute wait even though we have a reservation a someone in the industry i think this is completely ridiculous my ex s restaurant told people when they made a reservation that they had a hour window after that they ll politely ask you to go to the bar or leave that s how a reservation work if i have a reservation and theatre ticket at asking me to wait is completely ridiculous the restaurant around the theatre always ask how much time do you have which is fantastic but fine dining around other area should stick to this principle if i thought ahead enough to make a reservation then you need to think ahead enough to make sure i m sat at the time i reserved a a server i don t think this is an unreasonable request
hi so i m an foh manager and had quite the shift tonight so our po system ha been of course being a po recently so right at right a we re doing shift change and going into dinner service everything go down i m running around like a crazy person trying to get shit back online after two unsuccessful reset we call our go to i t guy who miraculously is available and come to bail u out in the meantime we have called all reservation to let them know about possible issue a far a making cc payment etc we were worried for a minute that we might even have to close due to too much chaos we are not experienced with a handwritten ticket system don t have the ol knuckle buster etc so our host said a much on the phone we also have a top reso for pm which arrives on time yes this nonsense is still going on hour later i think my left eyebrow went completely grey tonight not looking one of my amazing bartender get a round going for them while we are still scrambling to get thing back on track he comp the round they re having to stand a bit awkwardly in the lobby in front of the host stand which kind of suck but also they knew what we were dealing with and they are sipping on free drink at a we are about to seat them have the table all ready just need to put menu down the birthday girl loses her shit at one point we were going to seat them in the upstairs section but ended up switching thing because of reason they had not reserved an upstairs table we just were going to put them up there which they unfortunately overheard and we ended up changing our mind because it made wayyy more sense to seat them in a perfectly fine downstairs section for some reason the birthday girl got absolutely irate at this change i heard her going off at my host so i went over to see what the problem wa she just kept pointing upstairs and saying that they were going to sit up there i went over and explained that we had a table all ready for them elsewhere she wasn t having it started saying they d be going upstairs anyway and i better figure it out said she wanted to get out of this which i assume mean she didn t want to be standing awkwardly in the host area i get it but the table i wa trying to take them to wa out of the way of all that i explained that we did not have a server working upstairs but did in fact have a table ready over there with a server no dice eventually my lovely bartender from earlier come over and get them settled at the proper table good rapport go a long way the birthday girl did pretty aggressively shoulder check one of my server and the bartender ended up taking the table because everyone else refused to talk to them but nothing burnt down though the insane bday girl did threaten it finally before the dust had even settled on all of that bullshit the boh guy got into some huge fight and for a while of the kitchen walked out more went to find out what wa going on help defuse the situation and so i jumped on the line for about twenty minute while everyone got their shit figured out fortunately i ve worked boh before but not any time recently so i wa slow a fuck eventually one of the guy came back and bailed me out then the others came back one guy completely walked out on his job tonight for such an incredibly petty reason i still don t really understand what happened but i guess i ll be illuminated tomorrow what a stupid fucking night sorry shoulder checked server
hey server i m a host at a breakfast restaurant and we get super busy most day waitlists probably thursday sunday i am also normally the only host regardless of how busy it is i m the only actual host the rest are just bussers who are in highschool and just work when they can this place just opened so we re all kinda on the same level no seniority within the restaurant i wanted to be a host because i feel the income is more predictable i have a few question about random day to day stuff that i feel are weird in my restaurant and want to see how others operate do you let your host know if you re cut i ll go to seat a table and server get visibly annoyed and tell me they re cut how in the world am i to know that is that normally on the management i ll always happily assign the table to another server but i d prefer to avoid the situation altogether obviously do you expect the host to bus all the table a few server will pick up their tip and not touch a single dish being the only host and sometimes without any bussers this really cause people to pile up at the door we weren t too busy the other day but because i wa the only host and there were no bussers there wa a minute wait list because a few server would not bus their table we also pre set our table so bussing and pre setting a table entirely on my own can take up to ten minute if it s a big one obviously causing a backlog of people and a lot of empty table if i were to approach these server about how this make it hard for me to do my job what would be a good way to go about it i don t want to be rude but it frustrates me to nooooooo end if you pre set table is this the host s job for u it wa never really delegated but some server come up to me and say something like hey can you set up table thanks like not a question then go just stand there in the host booth and hang out like why i have people i need to seat you have no table can t you at least assist is that a fair way to feel i actually really like this job but being new to the formal restaurant industry i am not sure if these are like normal thing i should just shut up and deal with or if they re worth bringing up thanks everyone
it s pretty standard for u two give two room key to everyone that check in we will give additional if they ask for more i get kinda annoyed when they say just one key please it s like they are sacrificing or trying to make it easier for u it take two second to make a key and majority of the time i ve already processed and halfway making the key when they ask maybe i need to get over myself or doe this bother anyone else

sorry but i always see these post but want to share my story i ve been working a a host at an asian restaurant for over a year now in january and my job said to just learn the menu and they d make me a server the day i work aren t even that busy but i sometimes will need to bus a table or two if it get busy so i asked question about being promoted a couple of week ago my manager said they d promote me when they hire some new host no one is applying here to my knowledge one person wa promoted before me after working only for a couple of week and i m convinced it s because they are from the same racial and ethnic background a the owner another person wa hired then told not to come back after their first day on the floor alone due to a rush an top top and some smaller table came in all within a span of minute they were the only server on the floor and they didn t perform adequately bartender and management were talking shit the entire time so third strike is that this girl who ha barely any server experience come in get a serving job on the spot she look familiar because she wa fired from my previous job love triangle in the job gone wrong turn out she is the same race ethnic background a well a the owner she start training and is on the schedule so i confront my manager and ask what the deal wa because i thought we were looking for host and i could be promoted to server i m reliable friendly know the menu inside and out he just reiterated that they need me a a host and can t promote me until they find someone for me to train not only do i feel like i ve been discriminated against for my race or not being a certain race but i feel so stupid for sticking around so long picking up shift when needed coming in on day off including during my vacation when server ncns and being a team player my sister is a lawyer and say it sound like a title vii claim waiting to happen thankfully i got a job serving at a corporate chain my first night on the floor the other night went great and now i feel like i can get this experience i want and move on from hosting it s not glamorous but i m going to learn the rope and move on when it is time i m finishing my two week and the management is giving me the cold shoulder but i don t care because at least i gave notice i know it s a tale a old a time but just remember it s not you it s them they could train you if they wanted to every server ha had that first table they ve ever served you just gotta find someone willing to take the chance
you read that right i had a guest come to the desk this morning wondering why his rate changed from monday to tuesday not totally unusual and i explained it wa due to our occupancy whats available etc he became very upset at that so i pulled up his reservation expecting to see that we had manually made it for him and forgotten to tell him the rate wa going to change but nope he literally made the reservation himself through a travel agent i told him the agent would tell him the room rate for each night and he right away blurted out no no it definitely didn t so i then asked but it did inform you of the total of your stay correct and he said yes it did i told him that despite the rate changing he wa still paying the exact same price instead of paying for each night he wa paying for the first night and then for the second night i explained this in the simplest term i could think of and all he had to say wa that he wa never staying here again and wa going to a different property i wished him a great day and just couldn t help but laugh
on mobile i wandered in due to the youtube community who read them out but also to add to the fun i work at a military hotel these are hotel that are normally on a u military installation or base overseas and ha rule written by the parent branch i e navy lodge ha rule by the navy air force inn ha rule from the air force etc our rule are that we allow guest to bring their pet but with some restriction such a breed and pet type a well a how many are allowed before with manager approval you could bring in extra pet or exotic one but it wa a case by case basis due to issue with some people bringing in more pet than they said or the pet being obviously on the breed restriction list our gm decided to only limit the number to two and so come my shift i wa asked by our front desk manager to call a guest a we turned over the shift due to a few other reason with their pet but also to inquire about them having one more than allowed i got the husband on and the conversation went well for a bit until i mentioned the extra pet me yours truly g guest me so also our housekeeper saw you have x number of dog in your unit g yes me ok so the limit for those is x number so you will have to kennel one of the dog if you d like i have a list at the front desk for you g oh no we re putting one down me oh my coworker confirmed that my brain had to load that info and thus the ellipsis wa embodied while i wa on the phone me currently thinking what what are you sure about that a i said we have a list of kennel g no i m sure we have to honor the rule and so one is going to be put down i do not know if this man wanted me to say nooo not the puppy i don t know if he know i heard and can look up the type of dog he ha i m not even sure if he guess i wanted to know if the dog wa old and it wa just his time i do know that i called his bluff i think i ll update when i can me alright sir when that s done please make sure to bring u the updated shot and rabies record for our record please keep u informed of this and remember all other detail mentioned before g ok got it so after all of that wa done my coworkers asked the outcome i told them then emailed my gm front desk manager and housekeeping our housekeeping manager came out in shock within a minute of the email being sent me i just reported what he said coworker wait doesn t he have a camper me oh yeah he doe coworker why isn t he living in that it cost le and he can have all of the pet me i didn t ask for the sordid detail after one will be put down came up so now the man is not only on the shitlist with housekeeping due to some mess but also because he tried to use the dog a emotional blackmail also until there s more info i ll have to keep everything very vague this is not the weirdest thing to happen in our hotel but even on military base you get people trying to get out of thing
i apologize if this seems to be going everywhere i m down to a few hour of sleep a night i m just trying to put it all down this hotel is sinking and i wa about to go down with it one of my last post involved a lot of wrong doings going on at my location but due to some good advice i ve been keeping record of everything i wa hoping to find a new job even looking outside of the hospitality but haven t had any luck even follow ups went nowhere so sadly i wa stuck good news is that my husband is pc ing to a very square state in the middle of the map so i m excited to get out of here however i am stressing so hard over finding a job out there that it s keeping me up amongst other thing i hope to stay in the hotel business but with the luck i ve had looking for something down here my vision is very bleak looking past that i wa able to fight for a raise and fight to become an actual manager at the location i m at now i had the dm approach me recently to ask if i wa interested in becoming an agm or a gm at a location they re opening up but had to turn that down since i m leaving in march and it hasn t opened yet my current gm is probably not going to be on for much longer she ha an insanely high turn over where there is only five employee that have been here longer than six month we re constantly under stocked even though she keep going over budget she run to the store when we run out of item but sometimes get the wrong item she bought sleeve that were too small for cup for example and the amount of guest that spilled coffee on themselves forcing it to fit wa too damn high if it wasn t for me our invoice and bill would go unpaid our score are low low low the only ten we get are staff interaction a soon a we get a department properly filled with people she look at the hour they get and then they re fired in this week alone she s fired three people who were showing promise of actually staying here a far a i m aware many front desk plan on leaving when i do since she never support u and will throw u under the bus to make herself look good to her bos and the guest i again got written up for following policy that she put in place because a guest said it inconvenienced them i refused to sign that one too ever since i put in my resignation she s been playing with my schedule even though i can only work certain day sometimes i ll get twenty hour this week i get one day off and she want me to come in for it she tried to tell me she won t give me the overtime for it but i let her know i m tracking all hour if i don t get paid it ll get added to the rest of the folder i m just excited to start a new chapter in my life with everything that i ve learned hopefully to carry it to wherever i fall next at least i m not going down with the ship
i m thankfully no longer in this job but oh boy this customer wa a doozy without fail she would complain about something every single day according to her our service wa terrible slow rude whatever she wa upset about that day yet she wa a regular and came in nearly every single day go figure this particular interaction wa the first time i d ever served her before i knew what a royal bitch she wa for context the cafe wa small and when it wa slower whoever wa on would take order make coffee and run food drink not really any designated area a there weren t enough staff in slow time it wa counter service with the coffee machine next to the till so people would usually come to the coffee machine if something wa wrong with their order this day i took her order and made her coffee she come to the till and our exchange go like this me hi how are you today heinous bitch hb give me a light cappucino she s rude whatever but i have no idea what you mean by light do you mean skim milk do you mean more froth me sure when you say lig hb yes a light cappucino light me okay so did you want it with hb light it s dollar right here she give me money and walk off and she s already in a huff so i just gamble on she want skim milk bc that seems like the most plausible interpretation nope she came back a few minute later screeching about how she said it time why can we never get her order right how hard is it to make a coffee correctly tbf it wasn t what she wanted but i tried to ask and she s a regular how do we not know by now this wa my first time serving her all i could get out of her wa she want it light but a i tried to tell her i don t know what she mean and i don t know what you want anyway luckily one of the long time staff member had come in by then and knew what she wanted she wanted it weak could she honestly not have used the different word this wa only our first interaction i had the pleasure of dealing with many more joyful interaction with her over the next year working there in spite of our sub par service she just couldn t stay away
literally big fat on
i m at a property within comfortable walking distance of the festivity we ve got a full weekend and it feel like every second person ha been asking if they can just bring a friend that exceeds our room capacity when they arrive tomorrow the others are asking for extra parking last weekend i wa playing room roulette juggling overbookings and walking people because the owner like to sell room privately and forgets to note exactly why a room is suddenly unavailable for week one more week to go
howdy long time listener first time caller a quick about me so some decision will make slightly more sense i m a white male so i tend to be able to intimidate my way out of some situation with rowdy guest on the night shift so this happened probably around two year ago and to set the scene i will need to describe a bit of the layout of the strange hotel i worked at being in the mountain our building wa built on uneven ground which caused our front lot to be level with the first floor and the desk and our back lot to be level with the second floor above the desk strange layout but it meant that there wa an entrance on the second floor for people to enter if they had already gotten key secondly our front desk wa closed off so people can t just walk up behind u to get to the desk one first had to go through a door to get to our back office then another door to get to the desk the first door wa always accessible by physical key only which the person on duty carried with them hotel layout nonsense aside this happened during the winter month so naturally i brought a jacket with me to work which wa hanging on the back of my chair at the desk far enough back that it wa out of reach of anyone at the counter i wa working night audit a per usual that day and the shift started off smoothly however about an hour or two into my shift probably around midnight or so i began hearing footstep coming from the second floor i wrote it off a some people coming in late through the back entrance however the footstep kept coming around every minute of so eventually sometime between a m i decided to go up and investigate i locked up the desk ensured all the door were shut and went upstairs i decided to take the elevator to the fourth floor our top floor at that property and work my way down the stair since it seemed like whoever wa doing this wa pacing the hall eventually i worked my way down to the second floor just in time to see the elevator door shut and hear the elevator going upward i ran up the stair and cut them off on the fourth floor out of the elevator stepped a man clad only in his tighty whities and my jacket he wa yelling into a walkie talkie that he also stole from the desk presumably while i went up to investigate he went down to the desk and pulled this bizarre heist also in his hand were a few snicker bar that he stole from the sundry located right next to the desk a i approached him the overwhelming smell of alcohol hit me after yelling at this dude to give back my jacket i told him he had to return with me to the front desk i took back all that he stole from our desk which he presumably climbed over and told him he had to go back to his room or i would call the cop i passed this along to my gm got this dude on our dnr list and informed his bos that he wa not allowed to house this dude at our property anymore apparently bos wa paying for the room fun night though not the only wild story i picked up at that property tl dr drunk dude wearing nothing but his underwear jumped our desk counter stole my jacket the desk walkie talkie and some candy from the sundry and wa just walking up and down the hall until i took everything back and threatened to call the cop
a few month ago there wa a nation wide call back on romaine lettuce so during that time we were using iceberg lettuce instead no big deal today a lady came in and ordered the lettuce wrap not realizing we switched back to the romaine no worry brought her the iceberg wasnt an issue minute after they leave she call the restaurant our service wa fine but you switched to romaine lettuce and i wanted iceberg i m never coming back that wa my first table of the night my whole night wa just table with pesky complaint about nothing do your hamburger patty have any gluten in them we re from italy pasta should be served with a salad why would you order shitty restaurant pasta and expect italian standard by my last table i had completely lost all patience and when they asked if we had kokanee on tap i turned and said no and kokanee is a shitty beer that ha no place being on tap they bought it a a joke thankfully and were fine but were quite upset when i said the same thing about bud light which we do have on tap worked hard to keep up with the push tonight and i know i wasnt the most patient person but i still delivered good service my last table stiffed me on a bill i wa laughing and joking around with them all night lady mid s one wa celebrating her birthday i guess you reap what you sow though because after dealing with all of the negativity of the day i walked away with far under edit this also just happened buddy wa hanging out at the bar i get off and start talking to him kind of a weird guy but nice enough he get drunk off of beer and get his bill a the debit machine is going through the step to take the money from his card it fails and he bolt damn guy knew i wa having a rough day and didnt even offer to buy me a drink even though he wa planning on bailing the whole time what a dick
hello all don t know how it took me this long to find this subreddit i work in a room boutique hotel in paris my favourite story from ha to be the middle aged american couple who showed up in the middle of trade fair season of the city fully booked and highest rate of the year for check in and showed me a confirmation voucher for a resort in spain me sir that s the wrong hotel guest oh really me you re in the wrong country guest only mildly surprised oh how interesting our uber brought u here from the train station though the best thing about it wa how his wife and him seemed unfazed by the whole thing they just kept repeating how curious and sat in the lobby for two hour looking for an available hotel i had to escape to the back office at one point to laugh because i couldn t hold it anymore fortunately they were nice and polite but talk about making the wrong booking
obligatory stuff first this is my first time posting i am mobile so sorry for formatting issue and the wall of text and if this doesn t quite fit for this subreddit i would appreciate being steered to a more appropriate subreddit cast pl pizza lady joe the man on the oven em our expediter me well i m not sure who this is name are changed because you know reason so for a couple year i worked at a national pizza chain that work in a similar style to chipotle the gm of my store wa determined to have customer satisfaction over anything else and a a result we tried to make sure the customer wa happy with their pizza and if they weren t we did everything in our power to ensure they were one afternoon we are fairly busy and are cranking out the pizza at a steady rate people are happy and the store is running smoothly i am on the register helping people out offering drink and whatnot then pl walk up she doesn t initially grab my attention she is just one of the many face that go by during my shift she pay sits down and wait for her name to be called to come grab her food now joe is pretty good on the oven and usually he ha little issue with keeping the pizza looking nice and not overcooking them which is usually a surefire way to get someone upset so pl s pizza come out and it is perfectly cooked em call out pl s name and she walk up and take one look at her pizza pl it is not cooked enough we ask her if she want it thrown back in which is a bit of an issue due to the pizza being cut but we can do it she say yes and in the pizza go again joe is a touch frustrated having to cook it longer but he say nothing minute later it come back out it ha gone from golden brown to a darker shade but still look pretty good em call pl up pl i want it darker we all pause for a moment then em apologizes and say we will throw back in joe s face is getting redder a sign of his rising anger but he still doe nothing the pizza come back out not looking particularly appetizing anymore the crust is starting to turn black with the bottom developing black spot we call pl back up certain that she will be happy pl i want it darker em miss if we put it in again it will be completely burnt are you sure that is what you want u to do pl yes i want it darker put it back in em fall silent turning around and putting it back in the oven joe is now bright red struggling to stay quiet pl walk away sitting down and watching the oven second later joe speaks up quiet enough that pl won t hear him joe if she want burnt i ll give her burnt that pizza sat in the oven for what seemed like hour joe kept it right next to the fire to make sure it got cooked you could see that crust shrinking and turning black the smell of that burning crust stung my nostril a it moved throughout the restaurant it wa painful to watch finally joe pull it out and put it on em s counter the bottom and crust were a solid black with the topping beginning to turn dark brown black em look at it shudder and call pl up to collect her monstrosity pl this is perfect this is exactly how i wanted it there wa no sarcasm in her voice she wa genuinely happy with what her pizza looked like joe em and i stood there genuinely shocked at her reaction there wa no way she wa going to eat that a few minute later i left the store to go on break and i passed by her table to discreetly see how she wa fairing with her pizza from hell she wa two slice in and seemed to be enjoying it i left questioning whether or not i should be embarrassed to be part of the same specie a this woman minute later i come back in preparing to get to work and walk by pl to see her progress she had eaten the whole thing every disgusting burnt bite of that pizza wa gone and she wa acting a if it wa one of the greatest thing she had eaten joe and em were just a shocked that she had pl then walked up and said it wa delicious and she would be coming back since we could cook her pizza right then she turned around and walked off into the night that poor pizza haunted me for day tl dr woman wanted her pizza burned to a crisp and she ate every bit of it
a karen in the wild appeared a few day ago she wa nice for the most part until she wa given no a an answer when she wa on her last stay using her own card she brought me her company card and said that she need to make sure that this is on her reservation for the next night since she would be staying one more day on company time not a big deal a we have had their company here many many time before i go to look her reservation up and notice that it is nowhere to be seen i inform her that while i can create this reservation she need to have the company she work for send me the appropriate cc authorization form this is where she got sour and told me that she should already have a reservation and that i need to just take the card i inform her that under no circumstance will anyone at this hotel take that card without an authorization sent to u she raise her voice in that all too familiar manner and tell me verbatim this is ridiculous no one else ha ever made me give them that form i want that room set up now with a slightly raised voice full of determination i asserted my meager dominance over the wild karen and threw a pokeball firmly told her that i can not accept it legally she ended up storming off muttering under her breath about talking to my manager before stepping into the elevator and leaving i told my gm what happened and since they are still a bit new to how we do business with this company i told them what we require the next night i m on audit i wa talking over the day s information with nd shift and i get this extreme pleasure of seeing that we contact her company and they declined to pay for her room needle to say she wa more polite to me this morning upon checkout having learned her lesson through paying another chunk of her own money to stay with u

so when it s slow every saturday night when i get to work na at pm the owner is always sitting around shooting the shit with the agm the owner ha to go over a few thing i have learned that this mean that he want to give me some more busy work so that they can feel a bit better paying me for most of my time so after a few week of additional job duty like dust here or clean the floor this way or something else trivial the bos start telling me that i can tell him anything that s bothering me so i finally decide to take him up on it and put some spin on it i call him up on his personal phone after my shift is over and tell him that i end up working about to hour each week of overtime and that my check rarely reflects that i point out that my yearly total for ot hour is hour for the entire year despite me putting in at least hour of ot for the year of course he is totally you should be paid for that you do a good job for u and all that b next day my supervior roll into work at am and he s never in exactly at am thats why i get ot every week why you trying to get me in trouble he asks me i swear i didn t want to get you in trouble i tell him i just wa commenting that i have worked a lot of extra hour that never got compensated for at the correct ot rate so manager ha been told that he need to be on time he s cool though and we laugh it off he start coming in a lot earlier most day he s on time for about two week then he start to slide again and i guess the gm notice so they decide that the correct course of action is to adjust the time clock system we use so that it automatically clock me out at am even if i am still here the first day it happens i ask my manager if he clocked me out he say no i didn t asks why i tell him happens a few more time so far it s shaved about min off my hour about every other day so this seems very shitty to me i don t really feel like complaining every few day about it and being the squeaky wheel i know that route would eventually lead to them hiring another na and me getting my hour reduced or laid off for some fake bullshit reason ultimately it is a slap in the face to me and it s really effected my morale some other thing are begging to annoy me a well like being asked to sign up fake people into the reward system i wa told to do this verbally and i just say okay and i don t do it at all i am not going to put it in my name that i signed up all these fake people i don t care if it s trivial fraud is fraud so i guess it s time to start looking for a different place to work maybe not in the hotel industry though i can t really abide the dishonest shit that i have seen in the last five year working fd and na mostly na
guy came in and we have all waited on him many many time before and he always ha drink today he had a couple mimosa and when it came time to pay he told me that i charged him more for mimosa than anyone else in the restaurant i explained that there is no way for me to change the price of an item on the computer it s the same price no matter who ring it in period my other waitress both chimed in and said oh that s the same price you pay when i wait on you he kept denying it being like no not even close like i am fucking trying to rip him off omg he left still insisting it cost more in my section than anyone el seriously guy
so i just got this email from the restaurant i work at illinois please tell me if this is normal legal ridiculous or am i just being dramatic here is this week schedule from owner to further manage our food amp liquor cost we are instituting a new policy starting this tuesday regarding miss fire wrong order loss of revenue opportunity for our server and bar tending staff example are but not limited to these failure to place an order into the system allowing it to then be late and therefore requiring owner to remove that from the bill will now be a full cost to the server if a wrong order is entered and prepared that requires a new order made that incorrect order will be a full cost to the server if an extra cocktail wine or beer is prepared it is the responsibility of that server to make aware to the bar tender that item s ha been served if a customer wait too long for service for drink or food due to circumstance within their control the cost of that lost revenue will be to the server ie ignoring a table due to talking to another table too long in the back eating on your personal cell phone talking with other staff member owner have instituted a system that allows you to not make these mistake for example the ticket coming from the front register allows you the opportunity to review what ha been entered and make any adjustment prior to fire further under the law restaurant have the right to dock server pay for mistake such a described above including walk out however we also know that docking the pay for these mistake can not go below the federal minimum wage which we will calculate this is a fine dinning restaurant sourcing high end food which make mistake costly
hello everyone your two night a week na here tonight ha been an absolute shit show my hotel ha taken on a lot more flight crew in recent week frankly more than the current staff can handle the contract the flight crew have with our hotel state that we have to provide them with shuttle service to and from the airport unlike a lot of other hotel however we do not have dedicated shuttle driver when a shuttle ha to go out to airport we lose someone behind the desk frequently this ha meant second shift ha only person behind the desk while the other person is constantly driving back and forth between the hotel and the airport picking up countless air crew tonight one of the air crew arrived early a our driver wa coming to our hotel with another crew he had just picked up one of the fa called u and i told him it would about minute the allowed time per our contract for our driver to arrive the flight attendant threw a tantrum fit for a real queen cursing and screaming at me i handed the phone off to my front desk manager a he requested and he cursed and screamed at her too when he and his crew finally arrived our driver told u he had thrown a penny at him and yelled here s your tip our driver wa almost tear in addition the fa kept bitching and moaning about everything and making quite a scene to the embarrassment of his coworkers to their credit quite a few called down to apologize for his behavior apparently the head of the flight crew union wa within his crew and the asshole fa got told off the asshole fa the had the gall to chase around my front desk manager and berate and accuse her of ratting him out then there wa the drunk guy he wa just wobbling around the lobby being cringey at one point he lit up a cigarette in the lobby and had to be shooed outside anyway he wa staying with his girlfriend and when she wouldn t open the door to his room he started banging on the door so loudly i could hear down at the lobby then according to guest that called to complain he threatened to kill her i called the police but by the time he arrived it appeared he had finally made it into his room i wanted him removed but the first set of officer stated i would need to provide him with a refund for them to remove him i called my agm and got her approval to provide the refund another set of officer came down later though and stated that they couldn t do anything because he refused to open the door that the first officer had told me wrong and that they couldn t remove him that they couldn t even go into his room even if i opened the door for them because it wa like his house that it wa really a civil matter and that they could only stand outside in the hallway while i went in and asked him to leave not sure if all that is true but i really don t see the point of police officer if they can t remove someone from private property about to start the audit wish me luck guy hope the rest of tonight go better one bright note my front desk manager got a tip by a guy that saw her being hassled by the fa she almost broke down in tear update i made a second post to relay further drama with the drunk guy mentioned above but it look like it got stuck in the spam filter following is the event that occurred about two hour after the police left the first time fast forward about hour later and the phone ring a i m at one of the table doing the audit me front desk how can i help you guest get security to the rd floor now just a the guest on the phone said that a panicked young woman ran up to the desk sobbing and asking for help lady please help me my boyfriend is beating me up and he s currently up there with my newborn baby i couldn t get him to give him to me me i m calling the police now the young lady start heading towards the door lady i have to go outside judging by my previous experience with the police i figured if she left there would be no victim and they would again do fuck all me no you have to stay in here i say a forcefully a i can she wa absolutely terrified but i knew she had to stay to talk to the police i motioned for her sit down in the lobby a i talk to dispatch eventually dispatch start asking question about what occurred in the room so i hand the phone to her a she start talking to dispatch the drunk dumbass from earlier come into the lobby holding a tiny baby up against his shoulder he start to berate the young lady calling her methhead he then turn to me and say can you believe this she begs him to give her the baby and he say he s my son he get closer to her and she start sobbing and screaming at him to get away from her and agains begs him to give the baby to her he again turn around to me and say can you believe this then she say the word that are still haunting me or please give the baby to him please just don t hurt my baby all i could do wa stare like a deer in headlight staring at this man holding a baby against his shoulder part of me wanted to reach out to get the baby and ask for him to give him to me but i wa afraid that might set him off i wa just frozen deathly afraid that this guy might end up throwing this tiny baby against the wall or something finally after what seemed like forever he lay the baby down on one of our couch and walk out of the hotel the cop arrive finally after about minute after i started the call some paramedic come in and check both baby and mom out they leave are confirming they weren t seriously hurt the cop talk to the young lady for about minute they ask for a new key to her room since the drunk guy took off with the old one i make a new key and ensure that any old key the drunk guy may have will no longer work the cop go up with the young lady and baby to the room to make sure the drunk guy hasn t sneaked back into the room after confirming the room is empty the cop leave most terrifying and horrifying experience i have had at this hotel since starting a year ago i hope i never have to go through something like this again
so i work in a frozen yogurt shop when customer leave we have to wipe down the table and chair that they were sitting at sometimes party get up but stand around talking for a few minute but if they aren t at their table anymore i ll usually go over and clean said table this wa one of those time this group looked like a couple family that came with their young child were standing around talking i think waiting for one of their member to get back from the bathroom i go over and start wiping down the chair and one of the woman say excuse me we re still here in a very offended voice i apologize and say that i thought that they were leaving she say that they re still there again and i just walk away no biggie right for the next few minute my coworker and i awkwardly listen to her bitch to her friend about how she can t believe that i started cleaning their table while they were still there my coworker nervously tell me that i should apologize but i ve already done that don t like apologizing to stupid people unless i absolutely have to and also just get nervous with angry people eventually they leave and we re like cool but it s not over she come back in i pretend not to see her because i have a spine and demand to speak to the manager she rant at him about how he need to teach his employee not to clean in front of customer that s customer we shouldn t be cleaning in front of customer blah blah blah and storm out my manager told me that it wa fine and that he didn t know why she felt the need to make such a big deal of it but i feel like i ve reached a milestone in the food industry i pissed someone off so much that they felt the need to waste my manager s time
her review wa just a vague comment stating that she thought the room wa bad but she naturally didn t bother to give any specific a a bonus the last instance of bad feedback that i wa able to find for that specific room is month old it look like we might have to drop everything and start plan to remodel her room we can t leave ourselves with an unhappy karen
so last night i wa working and had a few weird table such a this one it wa a man and woman they ordered a salad and pizza whatever nothing exciting they finish their food and i come over with the bill in my pocket and asked if i could get them any more drink or dessert before i give them the bill which i do every time i drop a check the man go are you trying to gyp u me no just making sure i can t get you guy anything else before i drop off your check to which he doesn t respond so i walk away when i come back to collect their payment the lady asked what size the salad she ordered came in i tell her it come in one size and explain the sizing of all our salad to her lady well it wa too small me okay it wa the proper size but if you would like me to grab a manager for you i can do that man we just want to complain to you me awkwardly laughing haha okay well wa everything else alright with your meal man yes we just want to complain don t grab your manager you are the manager of this table hahaha we can complain to you because you re our manager me yes i sure am i took their payment and dropped that sucker off real fast because i had another table who wa timing me asshole and i didn t want to have to deal with their extreme weirdness anymore they left a decent tip though so i guess they were just taking the piss the whole time or something
my hotel seems calm and friendly but sometimes late at night we ve got some shady character i ll start with what happened when i got on shift this afternoon i clock in and and while the first shift gsr is doing paperwork they tell me the info on what s happened for today and mention that the police are currently talking to roomxyz say it like no big deal not sure what it s about they haven t said anything to u about it so i m like okay it happens and this is around pm broad daylight could be nothing so first shift leaf and it s just me and my manager a little while later my manager is like come watch this she rewinds the security footage from outside that room today and at first she s upset because we see people walking out of that room and they just keep coming seriously it wa like watching a clown car at least people come out and we re like wtf now myself and the night auditor have been telling my bos they d been causing mild issue and were shady and up to something for day by this point so all these people keep coming out of this room and are just hanging around the car parked in front of the door and then we see at least different regular looking car swarm up on the area it wa seriously so well coordinated my bos is like this look like something out of a freaking movie all these car move in at once out of nowhere and one of the guy outside bolt back into the hotel room that s when guy in plain clothes get out of these and run up with gun drawn and start grabbing people and putting the gun to their head and i m like oh shit it a fuckin gang war out here wtf turn out it s all undercover police lol it seriously looked fucking wild on camera though and i m glad it happened because something wa definitely really wrong with that bunch of people so that happens meanwhile i ve got a guy come up to the desk that had checked in last night he had checked in for only one night and it s well past check out he s no longer in the room ha all his stuff out room been cleaned and re rented to a nice couple so at first i m like oh okay you wanna check in for another night this guy this guy ha shoulder length hair and a drug rug sweater a dog and a backpack and i had checked him in the night before seemed to be a traveling hippie type from up north wa nice a little stoner if anything lol so when i see him today i m not thinking anything and then when he get to the desk he lay across the top of the desk and look up at me and his eye are all glassy and he s telling me his brain doesn t work and he s about to pas out and something about a confirmation number but he is just straight up out of it we don t have a reservation for him and he doesn t wanna check in and it s just weird and awkward because he s not even on the same plane of reality a the rest of u right now and he start saying shit like i know you get this folder all the time but you re just so beautiful etc to be honest i don t even remember what exact word were exchanged cause the guy just gone so i m like cool he must be trippin on acid or something because of the look in his eye and the stuff he wa saying and how he wa acting so he leaf the lobby with no incident and i walk back and let my manager know what s up and she s like oh no kinda like dang what a shame she s like let me know if he come back so he doe come back and it a little more frustrating this time and he just still is all over he place not comprehending anything etc so he leaf again and my manager walk out she wa on the phone and we re not to disturb her while she s in a phone call so i didn t get the chance to let her know while he wa at the desk and is like wa that him and i m like yeah so she walk out and see him in the parking lot and go to talk to him come back and is like yeah that dude way gone i told him he had to leave but nicely and he agreed well buddy come back about three time being the same way my bos get to the point where she s like if he start to be too much of an issue tonight call the police if you can t handle it she leaf for the night dude come back multiple time again and again at this point it s night time he s saying shit like i just got a room an hour ago i m like buddy that wa yesterday he s still just completely tripped out of his mind but now he s le tripped out zoned out and harmless and starting to get more and more aggressive confused and ridiculous so finally one of these time i m in the parking lot telling him he need to leave yet again and he start screaming and cussing me out and another guest who wa outside an older man is trying to calmly get him to leave with me and he s hollering the whole way but walking off the property well awhile later and he s back again and i tell him to leave again and he s angry and i m finally like fuck this i walk inside and call the non emergency police and they send someone mind you i didn t call them before because it would seem like dude wa gone with no sign of him but bam an hour later he d show up again so i call he police they say they re sending someone a i m on the phone with him i see he s like trying to get into a random room now and i m like jesus christ so when i get off the phone with the police i look up the where dude wa and he s gone but his dog and backpack and still sitting right at the door he d been trying to get into she wa a good dog bless her heart so i m like shit where d he go so i lock the lobby and go to the stair right by the lobby going up to the second floor outside walkway so i can get a better view of the property and see if i see the guy anywhere i get to the top of the stair and low and behold he s right freakin there trying to get into another random room so i say nicely hey man what re you doing this man looked up from the door at me with the scariest fucking dead eye i can t even describe that look to be honest once he looked at me i wa immediately like oh shit i m in trouble and it wa a split second i said that he looked up and then he started to rush me so i instantly starting running backwards away from him and i m like what re you doing a i m running and he get closer and this is all happening really fast at the same time in my peripheral i saw a police car turning into our property and i m running from the fucking guy and he s chasing me and i fucking flew down the stair and he s right behind me and right a i hit the bottom of the stair the cop is jumping out of his car and i m flying past the cop and the cop is running the opposite way and i m just like thats the guy and the cop grab him from behind me and i just kept running i just bolt to the lobby and i m like what the fuck i mean seriously that wasn t some kind of weird situation that wa me running a fast a my foot could take me and the guy barreling down right on me desperately trying to fucking get me right then the night shift girl walk ima nd she s like what the fuck happened she wa pulling up right a the cop wa too from the other direction and her and the cop both had plain view of me running from this guy on the second floor and down the stair she s like when i saw you i wa hoping you just laid he dude out you should ve just started fighting and to be honest it wa that kind of situation if i didn t think i could make it down to where the cop wa in time then i wa going to have to fight this dude because he wa definitely coming at me to hurt me if i hadn t of called the police earlier and them show up right then i would ve had no choice but to fight the guy it s just insanity it s just crazy to me we have to deal with stuff like this every night i m the only person on staff in the entire hotel it s just me and it s like that for all of u gsr s only one person on staff and at night housekeeping etc is long gone and crazy crap like this or drug dealer or tweakers etc happens and we re solo here my bos only hire young pretty girl for the desk too because of course it s better for review or some shit idk but it s insane and apparently all the shit and situation that happen don t happen enough for corporate to spring for u to have a night security guard like seriously we re also not allowed to lock the lobby up at night and use the bulletproof window i m just like okay so what you re saying is it s basically the wild west out here and i better start carrying a knife to work we have faithful regular and bless their fuckin heart because they know how it is and often make sure to tell u if anything happens that they will back u up and come to our rescue at any time they also often come by the lobby at night just to check on u i even had one regular call the police once because i wasnt at the desk at night and she couldn t find me for a worrying amount of time someone s electronic door key reader thing went out and i wa desperately trying the emergency key to get them in their room but goddamn it s good know that at least someone would notice if i wa gone and something had happened to me sorry for the book rant for the night over thanks for reading also i m sorry if from my retelling it doesn t seem like the guy wa dangerous and ridiculous but he wa it s just hard to remember every exact thing that happened because it wa so much today but trust and believe that dude wa insane on drug and a huge problem i m not so good at conveying it accurately i apologize and also my bos want u to do this if we see an issue like this we are supposed to go out and confront it etc not call the police until we absolutely have to which is insane but what can you do
we hired this teen last year who caused u nothing but problem at first he wa cool to work with but he very quickly started showing his true color he never could show up on time he had lame excuse or no excuse at all he constantly took minute bathroom break during his shift best of all he would smoke his thc vape in the building while he wa working naturally he got fired pretty quick none of u here like him and he know it yet he keep coming back to order food he give u high maintenance order under the guise of friendliness a though he s entitled to being high maintenance because he worked here before i really really hate serving him and wish he d stop coming in at this point i feel like he come in purely to annoy u and i ve been tempted to tell him to not come back
i worked at a hotel for a while the man who became my husband started there a a housekeeper and i wa fd the gm wa on maternity leave so the assistant manager wa handling everything the fd manager who we ll call pb for psycho bitch thought that she wa automatically the assistant manager while he wa acting manager pb hired me which i wa thankful for since i hated my job she seemed normal at first my first mistake on my second day working wa when a guest called because they wanted to talk to our event coordinator i accidentally gave him her personal number instead of her office number they were right next to each other on the sheet and once i realized my error i knew i had to fix it i felt terrible but it wa an honest mistake i went to the coordinator and told her about it and she just told me not to do it again we laughed it off and later became really good friend pb find out and blow her lid at me i told her that i already apologized and owned up to my mistake and she said well a your manager i m telling you not to do that again the event coordinator wa a manager and i wa a little perplexed that she wa so rude to me about it but i let it go the next day i wa checking out a guest and his card hadn t been charged correctly i tried to fix the error and did it the wrong way again a simple easy mistake that wouldn t have happened if i wa properly trained pb come up stinking like cigarette with the craziest look in her eye i thought oh sh t she s a tweaker she start screaming at me in front of the guest swearing her head off now my cat had just died and i wa having a rough time i tried to brush it off and she came back to apologize to me okay nbd i wa okay with taking sh t since i d worked in customer service for awhile usually i had to take it from customer but after my last bos i didn t care too much a week later she wa talking about how one of the manager wa gay scandalous and i told her that i knew my gaydar wa great because i m gay she said oh my god that s so disgusting and i don t understand how you could make a choice like that i wa so shocked so wa my really sweet coworker who got in trouble for bringing colorful pen to work because pb had a problem with people getting thing for free from their coworkers maybe it s just because my coworker had never offered pb a colorful pen so yeah i went to the assistant manager about that her disparaging my sexuality and got transferred to housekeeping so i wouldn t have to deal with pb directly anymore cue complaint from pb about how horrible the housekeeper were how the fd is the most important part of the hotel etc another coworker on na shift went through her desk and found syrinx he broke the law by checking her hiring record to see if she had diabetes or anything else she might need them for but didn t find that he did however find out about her meth possession and distribution charge so i wa right about her being a tweaker the crazy eye and constant wearing of long sleeve in the hottest month of the year gave it away i ended up quitting the hotel business hating the nepotism and apathy but i have a good friend who still work there doing housekeeping and maintenance he s working practically hour a week because pb is the bookkeeper and accidentally did the budget wrong somehow losing you know a whole summer s revenue it would be fine if they could find the money the gm and the assist have been out to football game and on vacation a lot this year but no one know where all that money went i have a theory that they all split the money three way since can buy a lot of meth tl dr crazy homophobic tweaker manager loses a whole summer s revenue and it seems like no one care

a surprising amount of customer say that s good a a really ambiguous response i usually have to clarify and get the customer to definitively say no i don t want x or yes i do want x example c doe the sandwich come with fry or anything me it come with salad but if you want fry we offer something similar a a separate side dish point out fry option in the menu c that s good turn out he didn t want the fry option i m not a seasoned server so i d you have any thought or feedback about what i can change i m open to them and appreciate them

at the place i work at we manage both front desk and bar we only serve guest of the hotel at the bar i came in to work the other night saw a couple who didn t really fit in asked my colleague about them and she said they were guest they ended up ordering a bottle of wine wa really rude when doing so after ordering the bottle that wa about they proceeded by telling me i should give them a bunch of free stuff like chip and nut i told them no unfortunately we don t do that here i mean i could if they were nice but since they had been rude since the beginning i said no they then tried to get me to make them free sandwich um no after they had their wine they tried to get another couple to buy them another one and use their room nr i heard the conversation from the bar and asked the rude couple to leave they were not guest of the hotel told the morning staff about it he sent me a text saying they came back later that day wanting a bottle of wine saying they ve never seen our hotel before bullshit my biggest problem is that the evening staff didn t check that they were guest when they came in our alcohol license can be revoked if we fuck up on stuff like that also why do people always expect to get free stuff
