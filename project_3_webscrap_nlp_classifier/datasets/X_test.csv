my poor coworker who is black but an absolute sweetheart and positive energy woman some solo dude wrote that on top of one of the top table in permanent marker
before i begin i want to point out that no one wa hurt in the event listed below and there is an ongoing investigation into the matter now onto the story tl dr a guest who wa already checked out decided to stay in room then threaten employee with a gun when told to leave my shift the other day started off like any other quiet with the occasional drunk trying to start shit and failing nothing unusual where i live then just before my shift wa over the likely girlfriend of one of our guest say she want to check out no problem a long a they are registered to the room they can get the deposit back she take her money and leaf or i thought she left about minute later after i got done delivering a message to another room i hear a commotion coming out of the room i had thought checked out minute prior i go and inform my coworker and bos and my coworker go with me to the room when we enter we see the two now checked out guest still in the room the guy look wigged out on drug crack maybe and ha a vest like harness on with a gun holstered in it for reference we will call the guy jim and my coworker chrissy jim s girlfriend said some thing but i don t remember since she wasn t talking loud enough for me to clearly hear her the following fuckery insues me what are you guy still doing here you re checked out you need to jim cut me off jim we will leave when we are damn well ready to me sir you can t check out and then comeback in this isn t your room anymore jim this is my goddamn room and you need to get the fuck out of here chrissy sir you need to leave now you re already checked out you cannot be in here jim shut the fuck up slap his chest three time i m packing i know i m not that niave that wa a threat if i ve ever heard one me sir i m going to have to ask you to jim cut me off again jim now in my face so close we could be kissing what the fuck you gonna do do something do something now this wa probably not the smartest thing i ever did but it wa all out of instinct and reaction and not trying to piss him off more i shoved him back to get him and his smelly as breath off of me he regains his balance and is now a angry a a thousand wild karen he is now screaming jim get the fuck out of my room now get the fuck out at this point it s worth noting that i wa completely unarmed i normally carry a taser on me a a just in case but i left it in the office since if people are still in a room after checkout they will leave if a bit mad about it but this time i wa completely unarmed he now feel it is necessary to pull out the gun in his vest holster and point it right at my forehead still screaming at me to get the fuck out at this point chrissy order me to go to the office and call he s screaming how he is gonna wait for the cop and have me arrested for assault chrissy come back to the office with jim in hot pursuit he then start yelling at my bos who is just standing there confused a to what just happened i get on the phone with police and a i m talking to them he and his girlfriend get into his car and begin to drive off they turned off the side road where our motel is located just before the cop showed up he is still hasn t been caught yet but the police have all the information he need on him so it s just a matter of time until he is caught if there are any update to this story i will keep you guy informed
i ve been working at a restaurant for five year at a performance venue i like my regular schedule money etc we got a new manager recently and another co worker pointed out that they started auto deducting minute for a break per shift across the board for server kitchen and bussers i figure my wage is like something an hour and the meat is my gratuity but still it bug me the kitchen make a higher hourly and so do the bussers so they re taking the heat of it i get to sit down for ten minute unless i m on a working break or a longer one if there s a longer first half of the performance the kitchen take le of a break and the bussers never stop moving i asked the manager about this and they said legally they re supposed to provide a break after a certain number of hour that s how they do it at another restaurant the company owns and they re surprised we weren t doing it at my restaurant that other restaurant is also newer mind you they said they d try to make sure we get a break what s the best way to handle this
mini rant the joy of mood swing at work just had a woman phone me telling me that she didn t know we were in batheaston and that it didn t say on the website where we were umm love it say it on almost every page but that s fine call your credit card company it s only your time you d be wasting trying to do a chargeback when we have sufficient evidence that we ve done nothing wrong i didn t have to suggest i d get your taxi so that you didn t lose even though i can barely afford it myself but that s fine speak to your credit card company update she checked in she literally walked up to the desk and the first thing she said to me wa i booked a room by mistake but you won t give me a refund i am so sticking around tomorrow to see what she say another update she just checked out early complaining about the room and again that the website isn t clear i m quite proud though i stayed nice and friendly she s not getting a refund though there s no ground for it
another tale from the crazy night audit lady the other night a couple come in to rent a room our room are running at about i tell them this and the guy paying tell me he found the room online for i do my own looking we aren t allowed to take people at their word or use their phone a reference and the lowest rice there is i tell them this and guy still tell me that it s his girlfriend then point out he selected a hotel that sounded similar but wa not our hotel so he take the rate and go to his room if this wa the end of the story i would not be writing this i assure you not even an hour later he come back down to the front desk carrying the sheet from his bed this is how the conversation go me you guessed it db guessed it again db these sheet have shit stain on them me not even looking at them yet ew let me move you to another room cause that s gross db no i wanna check out that is disgusting me you want to check out no problem void the charge check him out and hand him the receipt there you go have a good night db what is this me you wanted me to check you out so i did db no i wanted to leave i want you to move my girlfriend me so you wanted me to move your room i already offered you that and you told me to check you out db no i wanted to check out and you move my girlfriend to another room i don t want to pay for this cause there were shit stain on the sheet me i can either move the room or refund the room and check you out sir those are the only option he actually ha no option now because i can t reinstate his reservation since the audit had happened in that hour db fine i ll get the health board on this they ll shut you guy down me of course have a good night he storm back off to the room and after about minute with no sign of him or his girlfriend i call the room and let them know they have minute to vacate the property or i will have the police remove them i stopped being afraid to call the cop a while ago after they left i finally checked out the sheet no shit stain looked more like another type of stain pertaining to bodily fluid another slow day in this hotel by the highway
on cell so sorry for formatting so this story start a mid range hotel that exists right off an interstate exit the bulk of our guest were truck driver or other traveler just staying the night so regular guest staying more than one day usually stuck out a little bit our hotel allowed pet we were supposed to charge day pet but my manager wa really chill and only charged pet unless there wa an unusual amount of animal service animal got in free of course service animal not emotional support animal this is important to the story so i arrive at the hotel and relieve the third shift lady i am unsure if she knew about this guest or if she wa simply too tired to give me a head up the breakfast attendant wa running late so i had to set up breakfast that morning all s going well not many people were staying the few that were up already were mostly kind but grumbling about the cold i live in a northern state and it wa middle winter after i started breakfast and made myself a hot chocolate i went back to the front and wa checking out a few trucker who had tossed their key on the desk and waved a they left i noticed a man walking around the lobby looking out the window but whatever i continue with my work when i slowly notice he is now standing at the desk i did a fast glance at him and ask if he needed anything while still checking out the guest no no just looking at the snow out the window then i become aware of something very close to my face i turn my head and look up and am face to face with a monkey i startle and fully give the man my attention he s still staring out the window and his small monkey sitting on the counter ha now climbed onto the monitor and is just staring at me the man finally notice that i am speechless and in a staring contest with this tiny creature seriously it s face wa the size of my thumb print maybe smaller oh that s just lucy she don t like the cold none i m waiting on my wife to get back with queenie so i can to have a smoke don t try to touch her though or me she get real jealous of me and is known to bite meanwhile i am still staring at this monkey climbing around on my monitor and counter at a m because what the actual fuck then a i am watching this monkey climbed onto the man s shoulder and shit it roll down him and onto my counter and desk the man still jabbering about the cold and how they re from florida and the monkey is used to a tropical climate reach down and just pick up the poopballs and continues to hold them while talking he finally walk to the trashcan by the door and toss the turd he then pull a banana out of his pocket peel it and eats it without even sanitizing his hand i am thoroughly disgusted and still speechless finally his wife walk in instantly bitching about the cold with a small old dachshund who immediately run behind the counter to sniff around the couple ignores this and i overhear the woman complaining about queenie not doing her business realizing this dog is about to mark her territory i call for them to please get their dog the woman took great offense to this a obviously i hate dog and why work at a hotel that accepts pet if i don t like animal lucy jump onto the woman s shoulder who then mean mug me a she go back to her room and the man yelled for queenie and go outside i cannot explain how quickly thoroughly cleaned and santitized the entire front desk afterwards i pulled up the guest list and looked for anyone with pet fee no one not one pet did they sneak them in at check in i waited until the manager came in and asked her they are service pet and are staying free yeah you read that correctly they made their two week reservation claiming two service pet then threw such a tantrum over the that the front agent just gave in and our bos didn t care since they were bringing in over a thousand dollar that damned monkey forced me to clean and sanitize the lobby multiple time a day and the couple wa weird they would go sit in their car staring at me through the window for hour not leaving once then they would come back inside complaining of the cold and the man would linger by to talk about how much better florida wa their room had to be put out of commission when they finally left due to the stench and the needed carpet cleaning not the only time this couple ha stayed here while visiting their daughter nor will it be the last it wa just the first time each time they throw a fit over their service pet to get out of
i ve been waiting table for year and in that vast stretch of time have still yet to find a reliable comfortable slip resistant dress shoe i m hoping someone here can point me in the right direction i just want something that s comfortable and would be acceptable in a fine dining steakhouse i really don t care how much it would cost my dog are barking let me know what you think

first post i have a bunch of story that i ll eventually share because i have a lot but i always find myself re annoyed with this interaction from a few month ago lol sorry for all the cap in this i just needed to emphasize that this man wa absolutely berserk backstory i normally work first shift i come in at am our night audit fill me in on the happening of the previous night that morning she said they had a complaint in the middle of the night that a drunk couple wa making too much noise so security went up obviously didn t hear anything too scary at that point knocked on the door told them to quiet down and left there were no more complaint a little while later the woman from that room came down to the desk and told our night audit that her boyfriend knocked the tv over and that the screen wa shattered gave her credit card and contact info and said to just charge whatever the damage were the night audit said everything wa taken care of and the couple checked out already just wanted to warn me that people might be mad about noise last night and to let a manager know about the tv if they didn t see her email it sounded like they just had a wild night or an argument night audit go home at around am this guy angry man come down to the desk to check out he s stayed here before i say hi good morning checking out angry man i am not staying here again me still smiling uhhh i m sorry sir what happened angry man what the hell wa going on last night i wa kept awake all night did you not hear that woman yelling me oh she came down and spoke to u about the situation i apologize angry man oh you talked to her what happened me really confused why this man is so worked up there wa a noise complaint our security guard went up to the room and the guest came down to talk to u they were drunk and a tv ended up getting knocked over and broken angry man silent and staring at me like i m a complete idiot their tv wa broken me yeah like make hand gesture like something tipping over and falling their tv wa knocked over and the screen shattered maybe the yelling you heard wa her being scared by the crash angry man you re trying to say all of that screaming wa because their tv broke me i m sorry i really don t know what you re referring to i wasn t working last night that s what i wa told angry man i heard a woman screaming like she wa being murdered for over minute me uh i m sorry did you let the front desk know that s what you were hearing we weren t informed of any emergency situation just that a room wa making too much noise i m sorry that the noise disturbed you but again we spoke to the guest and angry man no i thought someone would come check no one even called me back to tell me what wa going on or if that woman wa still alive it sounded like someone wa being killed in there i stayed up all night terrified wondering if there wa a dead body in the room next door me we wouldn t have been able to call you with any update due to guest privacy but our security did go up angry man i am extremely upset and i am never coming back walk away before i can say anything else amp x b and then a few day later a review pop up of this man saying he heard a woman screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night our staff did nothing and that this is clearly a dangerous place and then say that i laughed at him and told him all the screaming wa because their tv wasn t working i don t doubt this guy s story he didn t ask for any compensation and we at the desk only know so much about what go on in the room since we re usually multiple floor below but personally if i heard a woman screaming like she wa being killed and wa kept up all night wondering if someone had been murdered a he stated multiple time i think i might call the police or call the front desk and say i hear a woman screaming like she s being attacked and thing are being broken i think you might need the police involved instead of the drunk couple next door is yelling and i wanna sleep like damn you really thought this poor woman wa being beaten to death right next door to you and it upset you because it wa keeping you awake luckily she appeared to be okay so hopefully it wa just a drunken argument that got out of hand but everything about this situation still make me mad

really annoying we all weren t very sure what to think about her cl wa very indecisive very dramatic and never stopped talking when she first started she originally applied for front desk but we didn t have that available we had just hired someone that ha experience in our brand and with our system when cl wa introducing herself to me and the other person she asked how long we had been working here i told her about a year and my co worker at the desk said oh i just started cl then say oh so you re the one that took my job hmm ok and walked off we just looked at each other like wtf a couple

manager wa just having a bad day and cl wa no help the hsk manager wa just trying to keep his distance from everyone so he didn t blow up on them but cl took that personal a i wa counting my till and doing my usual arrival thing cl wa standing at my desk she very dramatically told me i need to speak to agm our agm wa helping the bistro get their money out of our safe or something i wa just like ok she finally squeezed her way into agms conversation and told her that she need to speak to her so they went and talked well she talked she come out of the office i kid you not she spin in a circle around our desk throw her whole body onto our counter sprawling across the counter with the back of her hand on her forehead and she tell u i have had a change in heart we re standing there wondering what on earth is wrong with her my co worker asks hesitantly why she tell u that she feel like no one like her and the hsk manager especially didn t like her we explain he is staying away cause he ha had a bad day and he doesn t want to yell at anyone she say that s just what they want me to think and walk off we were so confused so our agm and asks where she went we point her in the direction agm found her talking and talking and talking on the phone to her bf on speaker phone agm stood there listening while cl went off about what wa going on at one point she yelled to her phone are you even listening to me and our agm heard a confused oh uh ya agm interrupt and is like ok you are not suppose to be on the phone we don t pay you to complain to your boyfriend about your issue cl hang up on him and start rambling even more about how everyone hate her poor cl her job is so hard she ha to do everyone else s job yadda yadda so agm put her hand up and just say stop it are you on you lunch

doesn t show up i call her two more time and she finally answer she explains to me cl wa picked up by her bf and they saw si walking so they offered her a ride back to our hotel but they end up driving away from the hotel so another min after si finally convinced them they dropped her off the way si explained it made it sound like she wa almost kidnapped i don t know why she got in the car and i told her she wa dumb but anywho not long after the agm told u hey look at this cl posted a review on freaking google review here s the screenshot for proof she posted don t stay here unless you

down to the desk and is like are you serious i show her again and she just sigh and go to the agm i go back there too of course cause i needed to be apart of this so my sister explains cl doe absolutely nothing on her shift si always ha to do everything the next morning all she doe is text and call si all night long bragging about how many guest she s slept with for some tip then she blamed it on the front desk no one saw that coming si wa afraid of starting drama and making the working space difficult needle to say she will never be back and we won t let her tl dr crazy dramatic

my fellow auditor know you get the weirdest people at night well buckle up friend because i have a doozy for you we ve had this lady staying with u for month we ll call her bathilda or batty for short for the first couple month she just seemed a bit weird but she left me alone oh how i long for those day i long for the day when i d just see her when she came to complain about the noise level in our lobby and she s not wrong our gm might be deaf dear reader but she took it a little far anyway she came down the other night and wa talking with the person i wa shift changing with batty wa talking about some pretty run of the mill political stuff now i enjoy political discussion so i made a comment by whatever you hold sacred dear reader never do this you see i wa agreeing with her so i figured it wa safe and i had some information to elaborate on thing this wa sunday night she ha since come down every night to talk with me about other topic that interest her ufo i ve always been a mild enthusiast so fine demon i play ttrpg and i m catholic so oookayyy i guess diet keto and carnivore are my enthusiasm and she s been interested in those and then it get weird apparently she s been chosen by good not god who is also evil apparently but good itself good is gonna annihilate all product of evil which mean u and all of reality apparently evil spirit attack her for talking about the truth and good protects her from damage but let her show the symptom so that evil doesn t know it is ineffective it seems gravity will turn off when the magnetic pole shift according to someone she watch probably too much of on the internet batty hasn t been to a doctor in over a decade no really love essential oil get into argument with people on the internet about them even and is probably an anti vaxxer i haven t asked because i used to kill time screwing with those people on twitter for lulz so dear reader where did i mess up well you see sometimes a completely batcrap insane internet person will also have moderately normal political view you know the type and if their disciple mistake your agreement with those fairly normal view well you re obvious clued in on the truth of the world and don t think that your view aside from complete non caring make you safe trust me i ve met people of all affiliation who are a few crayon short of an la beast eating challenge but i d never made the mistake of agreeing with anything they d said don t ever talk about politics at work no matter how safe it seems lest you meet batty pray for me i have no idea how to shake this considering learning conversational latin and responding to everything she say in latin but then she d probably stab me in the chest with a yew wood stake covered in lemongrass oil or something

ah new year s eve where people randomly decide to take a hotel room for no reason other than to get drunk this guy thought he wa being smart he came in yesterday and paid for a room cash only he didn t seem to make it clear that he wa looking for a room on new year s eve and he wa checked in yesterday he paid for the room cash signed the paperwork took the key and went on with his business for the day come in this afternoon angry that his key isn t opening the door of course it s not he wa set to check out this morning he s yelling at me asking me why anyone would have gotten a room yesterday we had other room it s not like no one stay on the th and i ask him flat out why would we give you the key a day early i tell him that i can check him back in but i have to charge him for tonight and he practically flip it took me going into the back and getting the registration card that he signed to get him to agree to pay but i m betting dollar to donut that he put in a charge back on the account but if you came in a day early to take care of a room wouldn t you question why you re given key already say no i m wanting the room tomorrow not today update had the morning shift check with housekeeping and he did go into and use the room monday night dude is a liar and will be placed on our list
i honestly find it so entertaining the bad one are particularly funny because they are usually so absurd we were excited to eat here and we brought our dog because they have table outside upon arriving they told u they weren t serving outside how hard is it to just bring food outside this wa in december no we didn t have enough staff to serve outside table because it freezing and had we agreed i m sure she would have complained about the service our server forgot to ring in our food and one she realized she assured u that it would be to put to the front of the line we saw other table food go out before ours and even though she discounted the bill it didn t make up for waiting minute for our food i will say she did fuck up but she did everything possible to fix it and it hilarious that he expected the kitchen to stop making everyone else s food that wa already in the work i tried to call in a to go order and insert coworker name said they were too busy for to go order unbelieveable i drove by and half the restaurant wa empty get better staff this is ridiculous lmao dude probably drove by after the rush wa over what a shitty move calling out my coworker by name over something that wasn t even her fault it wa definitely during our peak hour and we have a tiny kitchen guest that are actually in the restaurant take priority over phone order what are your review v what actually happened story
i m a guest at a large chain that ha extended stay service i juat started traveling for my job and will be staying in hotel between day at a time it s all pretty new to me but so far aside from being bored on my downtime it s been good last evening very early this morning i and a few other guest on my floor were treated to a group of people renting about suite and partied all evening and into the very early morning yelling in the hall slamming the door why do the door slam so hard anyway smoking pot cigarette and drinking in the hall call were made to the front desk and the cop were called subsequently they were kicked out of the hotel but not until they argued with the cop for almost hour about how it wasn t them that were the problem it wa the rest of u that wanted to sleep um yeah last weekend saw a bunch of child s party and it brought about kid running in the hall food being smashed into carpet and to top it all off a kid throwing up in the pool cop were called etc etc point most people are cool but it s the asshole of the world that make thing hard to be tolerant of thing the people that work in the hotel and deal with this bullshit are absolute saint i work with the public daily but the crap i ve seen in my short period of time of staying in hotel long term take the cake how hotel worker dont drink heavily while on there shift is beyond me the composure i ve seen from the staff of this hotel is amazing but sadly it lead me to believe that dealing with stuff like this is fairly common place for this reason i do everything i can to not bother the staff and be a self sufficient a possible your job is hard enough without me asking for petty little request
guest ha apparently never been asked to provide a credit card at any hotel ever they booked online and had to put a card on file never called the hotel to say the company wa putting the guest up there or filled out a credit auth but boy did they have a confirmation email so that should mean it wa paid for had to make sure we knew that we re the only place ever to require that and that they wouldn t be staying with u again i just want to know which one of you mythical hotel just run the card on file and don t make rando guest that show up actually swipe or chip their card and how often you lose credit card dispute
i used to work for a professional service team with about people in the office all led by john smith the owner it happened that john and i were the only two guy working there when people called u it would ring at the main switchboard downstairs depending on who the caller asked for it could be routed to a specific extension or if it wa a general call or they didn t know who they wanted it would ring every extension and whoever wa available would pick it up it wa our own team specific front desk at least twice a day i would answer the phone with the following thank you for calling the smith group this is mark to which the caller would reply hi john john or my personal favorite is mark short for john which happened at least once a week it happened with such regularity that sometimes people in the office would call me no this is mark
edit apparently these sign are normal and fine refer to my comment with bullet point to see the real issue edit im just going to dump the actual story in here and get rid of the note it ll make thing easier another server would accidentally take my tip and mix them with his there were alcoholic throwing back beer and working in the kitchen many people smoked weed on their break while being a server the chef were sexually harassing the server and it wa known that they smacked a girl s as and nothing happened fighting between the bos and employee frequently happened in front of customer the restaurant itself wa messy and disorganized the menu wa gigantic and computer system wa complex the owner wa ruthless and expected you to be perfect the first time or else she d verbally degrade you she also expected me be willing to work unpaid like she demanded me to clock out yet continue cleaning the restaurant server would grab appetizer with their bare hand it disturbed me to see them handle spring roll and egg roll and throw them onto plate like it wa normal there wa also this special rice soup or something where they took hardened rice and crushed it up i watched the hostess casually throw hardened rice into a cardboard box and crush it up with her bare hand revolting overall she didn t want to pay me when i quit she yelled at me in front of the entire restaurant and i still remember her yelling you are a hassle another employee had to slip me the money behind her back and i ran out
long time lurker first time poster i work at a downtown hotel a full service property and we have valet per night plus tax it s not cheap and i know it suck for our guest not having many other option but it is not the front desk fault we pay for our parking spot so naturally we charge a little more to make a profit we get a fair amount of back lash from your average traveler stating that it is expensive and that it is another cost they didn t plan on well fun fact if you d read the website you d know the other day there were these people from canada checking out and they were giving my co worker a hard time about the cost of valet making a scene at the desk they went on to say that she had ruined their day because of it and how american are always ripping people off the funny part is the example they chose to use is if they were to come here and buy a car we would charge extra for a steering wheel alright well if it didn t already have one we would have to charge extra to put it in we deal with this a lot here at my hotel being so close to the border and it s annoying that they believe being canadian they should get free parking just because entitled might i mention that we do have a package for canadian resident that includes parking and snack from the gift shop did they book it no also they had a united state address on file so please tell me if you re canadian living in the united state you are entitled to special treatment
i apologize for the long read but i promise you this ll entertain you and i really need your help please read carefully and take in all the angle then give me your honest opinion amp x b i saw a post made not too long before i started typing this about a creepy manager but the post became too long to comment so i ve made a post i d like to address the industry plague of sexual harassment and gender discrimination i m a busboy but i do the job of three different people but i thrive in high pressure situation so i frequently step in to help server and bartender when i get ahead i m overworked and overpaid that s a doozy of a story in and of itself and i ve addressed it in post history but this is to address female server and the gross harassment they endure on a regular basis just to keep food on their table this might turn out to be a rant so i hope yall brought the reading glass amp x b the particular restaurant i work at ha a reputation with hiring attractive young server and literally only hire female server and bartender there ha not been a male server or bartender in the year history of the place and my manager the general manager who is closely related to the owner get away with everything and i just want to get it out amp x b i ve become very close with a few of the more extroverted server whose action may well be considered flirting when alcohol is involved however my manager ha taken it too far and ha deliberately told them to come to the basement to make out or to take body shot off camer a in one scenario he threatened a server my girlfriend s job if she did not come to hook up with him he general manager is currently dating a bartender openly and on several occasion now i and the female server have lied to cover his creepy as amp x b on our holiday party he ditched his girlfriend and followed u to my car where i drove all of u home because he literally would not leave my car and the police would start watching the lot soon we had a lot more drink at her place and he wa hoping for me to leave and being so drunk i wa about to since i had an early morning but i got a bad vibe and my girlfriend and i with another female server friend slept in my girlfriend s bed while he rode the couch he called his uber shortly after we went to bed and left without a peep at the same holiday party i had to physically remove him from my girlfriend a she s cry and verbally refusing his advance he quickly warns me never to touch him and try to sell it a some sort of joke and game that they ve had since before i started there i don t think so disrespect to me aside i m not going to let any man touch my female friend or girlfriend for that matter i don t give a fuck if he s my bos or the president amp x b i ve seen many girl just leave the place but we have a baby and she can t afford to lose the job at the moment i m a college senior a well so i don t have the time to find a new one we re both finding new job eventually but i just don t want him to get away with this anymore so many good people have left that place because of him and it s sad because i ve lost many friend in the year and that i ve worked there simply because i don t see them anymore and we drift apart it s unbelievable that i have to set the example on how to act when i m and he s amp x b it s mostly our word against his but we can prove some action and others have been vouched for by many people not just a segregated clique of coworkers here s a juicy list of his disgusting action amp x b what we can prove screenshotted text from bos threatening female server s job if she doe not make out with him video showing bos grabbing server s as a she s cry and pushing him away video showing server shake her head multiple time a my bos keep on trying to get her to take a lime out of his mouth which she then doe other shitty thing he s done snorted cocaine off server s breast smoked weed with his subordinate legal state so no trouble other than the owner frowning on it comment about employee s uniform suggestion compliment etc pressured former server into oral sex requested nude from server demanded tip out from server even though he is a salaried employee this is illegal verbally abused and demeaned employee when they question his management ability pressured employee into body shot sent dick pic to server it s fucking tiny amp x b if you got this far i thank you i d like to hear some honest advice about how i can proceed i can t go to the owner because they are related and he is fully aware of the sexual harassment and chooses not to lift a finger even when he witness it through camera footage i believe the owner likely hold this above his head because although he s a po my gm is one of the owner s hardest working employee and frequently doe work outside the restaurant when not on the clock anyway sorry for the length and i hope it s entertaining but this is a reality me and my girlfriend have had to live with for combined year it wa fun in the beginning but thing are taking a turn for the worst and i need to protect myself and my baby momma if shit hit the fan amp x b thanks jolt
just a quick rant about a table of four middle aged lady you know them that arrived on a friday night when we opened at ate and payed up by then proceeded to drink water for another min during an incredibly busy dinner service why do people do this at least keep your tab open and pretend to drink totally oblivious
so i posted about my anxiety about working alone i m not fully trained i ve been here a while but i work little to no shift each week it s super casual so i wouldn t say i m acclimatised to the place and i don t know everything there is to know about working there i m asking supervisor for help a lot i think it s going to happen again because of my shift pattern this week i just have a feeling icymi last week my supervisor wa put on a shorter shift than myself leaving me to run the place with no supervisor like the title say i suffer with anxiety a lot but i do face my fear a lot i think serving is a very anxiety inducing job but i feel safety in number hence why i hate being alone on shift i feel a lot of relief being in a independent restaurant but sometimes i think they can put you on the spot and expect you to do thing way out of your comfort zone are chain restaurant similar do they make you work alone sometimes

what do you do when a customer place a takeout order and pay for it upfront and upon receiving the order sits down at a table to eat it
from time to time i ll write about character here at my building this little ongoing story is about one of the amazing successful older professional woman i get to work with she s a lawyer and work in a judge sort of position she is smart a a whip and a force to be reckoned with so today she accidentally put her valentine s day card in the mailbox outside with no stamp solution she decided to stakeout the box until the mail carrier arrives to empty the box the thing is the mailman is asleep in his truck down the street she know this because she s the one who told me rather than wake the mailman from his slumber she ha waited for over an hour eagle eyed for him to come along and empty the box i don t know what she s going to do when he get s here but i m excited update a different guy picked up the post about minute after i posted she came back inside content and happy postman stayed sleeping for another minute or at least his truck stayed there for that long i wa hoping to see her chew out the napper but no luck she sure is tenacious and even keel af
background the hotel i work at is a hybrid of a capsule hotel and a regular hotel we have two different brand but they re run by the same company and use two different property management system this mean that i have to switch between hotel to search for customer so to aid this painful step i usually start by asking the guest which hotel they re staying at me hello checking in guest yes my name is guest me okay can i ask which hotel you re staying in a or the b capsule guest this one here me i understand we have two different hotel at this one reception counter so to search your name i need to know which hotel i should be searching wa it a or the b capsule guest i made my reservation on bookingsite me i see and did you make the reservation for our normal hotel or for the capsule hotel guest you have capsule here me yes we do guest i didn t reserve a capsule hotel i made a reservation for here me understood i ll look your name up in the a system honestly it may have been faster to just search his name in both system but logging in and out is a pain on the current pm in addition to there being three different way minimum to write his name potentially tripling the search time even to look up the reservation number requires bouncing between the two hotel s system
so i had a call today from a high tier super shiny snowflake member he call to order room service and when i tell him the total he bitch about the price i explain that there is a delivery charge in room dining service charge and then tax on his order now our in room dining service charge is and the delivery charge is a flat i think this is an industry standard because every single property i ve both worked at and stayed at ha these charge and they re all quite close to this these charge are also in our collective bargaining agreement and cannot be waived he wanted the manager on duty and i transferred him over to her now the company i work for us a system where every single case is imputed into a computer database and we can see the case from other property of the same company this guy appears to always order room service and then bitch about his service charge and delivery charge and because he s a super shiny snowflake member well looking in the system he appears to pull this at every single property all the previous property comped his meal my manager let him know that he s more than welcome to order a pick up from the restaurant or eat at the restaurant but we would not comp his room service meal he wasn t too happy but when there are case last year of complaining about this exact same thing somebody ha to take a stand she even used that when she talked to him and he wasn t happy he denied having complain about that and no hotel ever charged him delivery charge and room service charge when he ordered room service edit to add that detail of his comped meal
she wa the first person i met the day i interviewed for the job and we worked together for year she helped me through a lot a that wa the first job i had after getting clean and leaving someone i had been with for year she fucking killed herself i m just at a loss for word i wish i would have reached out and just said anything to her i hadn t talked to her much since i left that job because i quit during my shift and she wa upset i didn t talk to her about it first she wa the kind to hold grudge for like a week and then feel stupid about it and come to you to talk it out she wa so so loved by so many people i wish i could say something on facebook but i m friend with her family and her girlfriend and i don t want them to see my shit and think i m saying something for attention i shared the link to the gofundme and that s all i feel i can do anyway sorry for the rant admins feel free to delete this if post like this aren t allowed
breakfast cafe here little back story our restaurant is extremely busy on saturday and sunday to the point where we don t take reservation on either day ever we have a top come in state they had a reservation automatically we absolutely know that s a lie we found out that our other store in my town would accommodate them but they refused they wanted it at our store cool they would have to wait for a table waited close to min for this table party went from an to a get them all situated find out it s a mother fucking baby shower in the middle of our busiest time of day are you fucking kidding me everyone wa good except one person i went to see if anyone wanted drink and this bitch literally clapped at me clapped at me wa like i need silverware right now hahahah not don t ever fucking clap at me i may or may have not gotten extremely petty to her throughout the meal oops

this is a minor rant after a customer i had tonight he didn t want to open a tab but did order several item individually these item all just happened to be priced ending with cent like a drink a drink etc and i guess that wasn t okay with him he got mad and asked me why do they keep adding cent a if somebody wa hiding somewhere waiting for him to order so they could up the price by cent each time why don t they just round it out sir that is just the fucking price do you ask that question when you buy grocery gas clothes why do people always seem to think their food and drink price are up for debate what kind of dumb fucking question is that that s just what it cost and i don t really know what they expect me to say to that i shouldn t have to say this but if you re going out to a public business to buy thing you re gonna be spending money whether you like the price or fucking not
whoop atleast he understood

i used to think that working for a fine dining experience restaurant would be fun more paying and le karen to deal but the detail the detail of everything oh no not for me i wa working for a well known restaurant in my city the owner ha other in her name the kind of place where a table of will eat my rent worth of food in one night holiday season office party everywhere and every weekend available this groupe had people and i wa in charge of helping the waiter with the table we were just and that s alright the menu wa predetermined anyway but we have to change the cutlery in between service what i think it s a waste of time and totally unnecessary but look like our customer can t eat their main plate with the same fork from the appetizer so there i go to change all of their used fork and knife for clean one also paying attention for those who would need spoon and steak knife for their main course but i made a mistake a mistake that would have the waiter and the manager yell at me for min telling me to pay attention and to pray none of the customer make a complaint all i did wa to put the steak knife with people who were having lobster that s it i had a paper telling me who get what at the table but i misunderstood it and misplaced the knife i will avoid working for a place like this again i m more comfortable working with chill people
posting from mobile tldr at the bottom let s start this story off by noting that i wa on vacation for a few day when these event transpired and unlike the owner i do not have access to the camera feed remotely nor do i want access to the camera feed remotely this hotel take up enough of my time a it is i don t need to watch ant on a screen while i m home or on vacation or anywhere else for that matter would me being present at the hotel have stopped these thing from occurring possibly i can t say that i would have noticed something wa off but it s likely i try to pay attention to thing and sometimes check the nightly security footage on fast forward after i ve rewound it but ala i wa not around and most of this took place during the night shift while the warm body of our newly hired night auditor watched netflix on her phone do i wish i could fire this inattentive idiot or at least reprimand her oh of course but the owner have recently decided that we can t say anything to the night auditor anymore because then they ll quit and the owner don t want to have to do the work themselves until they find another warm body to sit behind the desk all night like a useless sack of potato so sadly even a the gm i don t have much say in the matter when it come to the owner decision i have already voiced my opinion on the matter to no avail so with all the background out of the way explaining why thing are the way they are let s begin a few week ago the owner hired a new day shift guy for the front desk he turned out to be a typical new hire working for a week or so then not showing back up a no call no show result in termination of one s employment and they can come collect their paycheck when it s ready no worry it s a pretty common occurrence a our hotel ha a ridiculously high turnover rate between the terrible pay and the lack of incentive to stay or do a good job a few day after the new hire kevin just never showed up i take off for a little vacation in the tropic for a long weekend not knowing what wa about to happen everything you re about to read ha been compiled from watching the surveillance tape and the account of my breakfast lady miss sue and the owner thursday night the last day i had worked while i wa busy at home packing without a care in the world kevin walk into the hotel while our useless sack of night auditing potato michelle is working he go behind the front desk and grab a master slide key and this idiot let him i guess he told her he work here but who the hell come into a hotel not on their shift and need a key who tell me common sense lady oh wait potato can t be bothered to think for themselves he then proceeds to go upstairs out of her sight god forbid she actually look at the surveillance feed to see where he go and into a room he stay in this room all night until the next day where he come downstairs to get breakfast with a towel draped over his head in an attempt to hide his identity miss sue told me that she thought it wa odd that a man came downstairs to get breakfast with a towel over his head but that s by far one of the lesser weird thing people have worn done to the breakfast room so she chalked it up to an odd individual or maybe his hair wa wet or something if anything she wa wondering if maybe he wa one of the area s many homeless but since he carried his plate upstairs and she heard a room door shut she figured that it s just some strange guest staying here our beloved squatter kevin proceeds to stay at our hotel in secret for another few night switching room each night after all the housekeeper had left and only using the side exit when entering and exiting the hotel had he been smart he would have at least made the bed back up to conceal the fact that someone had been in the room but ala he wasn t the brightest crayon in the box he also didn t come down for breakfast anymore a i guess he got spooked paranoid that someone might recognise him by sunday several guest check in and immediately go back to the front desk to complain that their room is dirty three room of guest to be exact one of the owner mr crick is working the front desk during that time frame and just assumes that the housekeeper didn t do their job so when they arrive at work on monday he confronts then about the dirty room they all insist that they had cleaned those room and that those room had not been used on their checkout sheet in a week or so of course mr crick think they re lying because that s just the type of person he is but begrudgingly rewinds through the security feed anyways just to see what wa going on it wasn t long before he ran across our nightly visitor and realised who it wa a during his nightly hallway stroll he made no attempt to conceal his face a i guess he knew that michelle potato wasn t checking the security feed enraged mr crick doe one thing he text kevin asking him if he can come in to work later that day because we re super busy and he need the help facepalm kevin text back of course be there at pm once kevin arrives read exit his room on the fourth floor go down the side stairwell and out around the building and back in through the front door dressed to impress mr crick phone the local law enforcement from the phone in the laundry room out of sight requesting that an officer come out to the property when the officer arrived kevin made it sound a if he still work here he s an employee look see i got a text from the owner telling me to come into work and the officer bought it it s worth nothing that mr crick yelling and screaming the whole time in a fit of nonsense didn t help the situation i think he truly failed to make the officer realise the importance of the situation that kevin didn t just have a room key he had a set of master key but he didn t and the officer let kevin go he let kevin go without even viewing the security tape it s like he couldn t be bothered with this petty hotel disagreement at one point mr crick finally got the idea kinda halfway across the officer responded with well it s just empty room what s really lost there i don t see the issue if there s just a few dirty empty room in which mr crick exploded i suppose rightfully so screaming that he will report the officer to the city and go and file a formal complaint with the main office so here we come back full circle my dumb as arrives to work early tuesday a i ve got a lot of paperwork to catch up on the first thing i see when i open the door to the office entrance where the time card are located is a large sign in comic sans font typical mr crick style kevin not work here no more no let him in hotel i chuckled to myself and thought heh wonder what the deal is well i now know the deal and i m the one who had to re key the entire hotel a of course stupid kevin still is at large with a master slide key tldr an ex employee of the hotel steal a master slide key and camp out in room over the course of a long weekend completely unnoticed by our useless sack of potato night auditor
here is part http www reddit com r talesfromthefrontdesk comment eqt n the mystery of the potential crack head amp x b so yesterday after my post for the first night nothing happened not until am this morning sunday when a guy left the property from the room a he wa leaving i could see that he wa high a a kite unfortunately i still wasn t able to do much a the proof i needed to get the guest out wasn t quite there yet and again we would have to jump through hoop with this insurance company fast forward to pm tonight just a the last shift wa leaving out the back door this guest came down to the front and took yet another guy up to the room at am they left in his car well he walk in the back with a whole new person and luckily this new person screwed up a they were walking toward the elevator i heard him say oh yeah man i m ready for that smoke and swirl just a the elevator door closed wa that enough proof for me yes but i needed more so i decided to do something shady a hell i wa pretty sure this wa a gay meth head situation so i decided to call my neighbor and ask him what gay apps he us to hook up i downloaded grindr on his advice and set up a profile putting the word smouke and swerl in order for it not to be blocked within a minute this dude hit me up and asked me to come join him in his room for some drug and sex there wa my proof i message him back and told him that now that i have the proof i need insurance or not that if one more crack head come to his room we will be calling chicago pd the dude he had just taken up immediately came down and left through the front door like a bat out of hell now i just have to show this proof to my acting manager in the morning and hopefully something can be done about this crack head if we can t get him out we can at least make him stop bringing people in for the safety of the other guest

hiya i ve had the following conversation three time now and person i commented on with this convo told me to post it quite often i get walk in guest who book online travel agent right in front of my face or out in the parking lot or sometimes even on the way to the hotel after calling me and asking about price and availability the hilarious irony is that we offer price matching if they just waited till they got to the desk and showed me their phone i would match any price they show me for a room in my hotel but anyway this ha happened three time now almost word for word they come into the lobby demand their room right now the following conversation then usually ensues i m sorry sir i don t have a reservation for you but i just booked it and paid for it unfortunately that reservation ha not entered our system yet therefore again i do not have a reservation for but i just booked it and and again sir i cannot give you a room without a reservation that is active in my system but sir you are welcome to enjoy our restaurant while you wait however there is no reservation for you at the moment regrettably our lobby and our pool are for guest only now is there anything else i can help you wi you can give me my damned room sir at this point i am going to have to ask you not to speak to me that way now would you like to book a room with me or would you like to vacate my lobby until your booking come through i d like to speak to your manager my manager will be more than happy to speak to you when they return in the morning that is unacceptable sir i have already asked you not to speak to me in that manner you are aware of your option do i need to call security today two of the three guest have then steam blowing out their ear proceeded to the restaurant one of the time this happened past pm our restaurant close at pm he then screamed at me so i guess i have to wait in my fucking car for like an hour to which i got to reply actually sir it is our hotel policy that there are no unregistered guest on our property after pm may i recommend the denny s block south they have excellent service and are open all night
not in a aggressive manner and especially not a service dog they are pretty much mute and invisible they may bark once or twice to alert you or someone but will stop when you say so and stand by your side service dog don t bark out of control when you walk by and try to get out the door when you slightly open it but but it my service dog i have paper blah blah that doesn t matter anymore once it behaves in a aggressive manner nor if you show a lack of control a you just did but not having it stop so fuck off and bye here is a print out of the ada law i ll highlight the part where it say we can kick out aggressive service dog even if it a legit disability or need god these fake piss me off they ruin it for legit folk who need them i hate this loophole some try to exploit claiming fake service dog a legit since we cannot ask for proof btw no service dog will ever need a muzzle out in public bye felicia

this is the most common lie i am told when checking in guest a guest tonight for a youth hockey league is checking in give me her debit card and it decline she explains that there is more than enough money on there and that she just used it i explained that bank usually pre authorize for the whole amount when we attempt check in and that i would need another card preferably a credit card so we could avoid the whole pre auth headache she hand me another debit card same bank same name but different number this one also decline she attempt to call her bank but to me it doesn t seem like shes actually on the phone with a bank if that make sense she called after which is their closing time when i googled the branch which is a small credit union who know though so she is still on the phone and pull out a credit card now and say this one isn t going to work i shrug and run it getting slightly annoyed that the woman who said she only had one card is now on her third plastic surprise it decline she roll her eye at me and finally give me a card and doesn t say another word it s good finish checking her in and send her on her way amp x b i just really don t know why people lie and say they only have one card and then have multiple or why even give me a card when she know it will decline like the first credit card it just make the whole check in process so much longer than it need to be

hey guy in my time a a hotel worker i have had ton of story happen to me so i figured i might start by sharing some of the shorter one and go on if people want to hear any more of them short info about me i m a front desk bookkeeping reservation sale worker in a small family business of hotel that are all in the same town my multiple position are important to note a they basically give me access to every part of the hotel and let me see everything from start to finish p s a with many people english ain t my first language you re allowed to keep any mistake you find amp x b amp x b story the snake i had the middle shift at the reception that day so i could take care of some debtor while the early late shift do their thing of course whenever it get busy i ll drop what i m doing if possible and help out at the front it just so happened that a couple of posh lady wanted to check in and my colleague wa busy at the moment i take over and begin the check in process pretty standard stuff have them fill out the form and explain everything ot them while checking their reservation i already see that their price for two night wa way high because they had booked their room on an external booking service would always charge way more which will be important later all go a planned and they go to their assigned room one hour before my shift end at around pm one of the two lady come down visibly angry lady sir the aircon in our room is broken and it s like c in inside i demand that you fix it or reimburse me me one second let me take a look our aircon ha a central control unit at the front desk so we can see everything lady yeah try to be fast internal eyerolling intensifies at this point me so your room temp show at c and the aircon is currently enabled if this feel too warm for you i would be happy to regulate the temp down for you or you can simply open some of your window if you d like since your room is out to the quiet side and you wouldn t hear a thing lady yeah yeah get on with it regulate i don t have time for this she scoff and outright stomp back to her room amp x b i tought that wa the end of it the next day i talk to the night manager a i had the early shift and he instantly tell me that the two snake had been complaining to him all night that the room wa wayyyy too hot and he even went up to check but it wa actually cold a heck in there he offered thin blanket regulated temp down a far a possible c and told them they could switch room in the morning a we were fully booked at the moment i prepare for the worst and am actually surprised when one of them show up later lady come to the front desk and tell me that her colleague couldn t sleep because of temperature issue but that she didn t think it wa all that bad me feeling quite sympathetic no matter if it is justified or not offer her free cup of coffee and ask if they want to switch room and she just say that it s fine fast forward a week later a i have full access to all of our booking service i check the review and see that a request had been made for a full refund on the external booking service the snake had used she wrote in her message that no one bothered to help them in any way possible and that she expects some sort of reimbursement and that we should have done more and thus need to check what can be done for her now at that point it finally came to me they just complained randomly to make a case for a free stay at our hotel i wa having none of it and went full rambo mode i basically sent an open message to them external booking site can read those and told them how it wa odd that this request wa coming up since i wa around and for two day straight had done everything possible for them and even offered to change upgrade their room for free and had also given them some warm beverage on the house that i could not understand why she wa trying to get money back on this way now when she had refused any of our attempt and making her stay a amazing a possible i forwarded the content of the mail to the owner he is rather involved of the hotel to make sure he know if more angry message come up that i wa the one to instigate this a i really dislike having the hotel taken advantage of i have not heard from them since amp x b amp x b amp x b story the raging tomato this one is shorter we offer a discount at surrounding parking garage a this city is very crowded and offer almost no parking space anywhere that is free to use an older guy come to the front desk and asks my colleague an apprentice where he could park is oh so expensive car and being a well trained apprentice he hand him a small map cut out with all important info a to where he could park and even go a far a explaining in great detail how to get there that said it s actually hard to miss you simply have to drive up the road and turn left the rd crossover it s a minute drive and a minute walk back to the hotel a the way on foot is actually even shorter without even asking anything else the dude run off throw his luggage into the foyer and actually forgets the small map cut out about one hour later i had stored his luggage in our dedicated space and imprinted his face in my memory so i could return it to him he return with a red head and visibly angry about how it wa impossible to find his head wa fiery tomato red and he continued for a good minute how we should have parked his car for him a service we do not offer since so few people ever come by car due to superior public transport and that we intentionally did this to him yadda yadda i stepped in and let him rant all he wanted and even apologized to him just to make him calm down after the ranting he realized his luggage wasn t where he threw it and he go off again about how someone stole his important luggage i tell him that i took the liberty of moving it a we do not allow unguarded luggage to sit in the foyer for various safety reason the dude basically tell me i need to keep my dirty hand off them i apologize again and tell him that this is simply company policy and i have no say in it but he is welcome to leave a formal feedback for which a form is supplied in every room after about minute i finally get him to check in he even get a complimentary glass of our branded sparkling wine and seemed to calm down and turn from angry red to alcohol red fast forward day i read the online feedback and the guy basically slandered u with all kind of accusation about how we have the worst service he ever had and the room are terrible yadda yadda one of our hotel is actually constantly in the top of the region on various rating site and we pride ourselves in that being a lowly hotel we didn t do anything about the feedback other htan thanking him for it which must ve pissed him off even more since he wrote a mail directly to my bos who also shrugged it off after having everything complained sadly there is no revenge here just wanted to share the second one a i found it funny how some people brain seem to work and how i will always think of him when seeing a ripe tomate i have ton of other story some of them going nuclear but they are rather long so i ll only share them if people actually want to read them have a nice day y all

i started working a a server at an ayce sushi restaurant recently i m female btw and on my first day at work i caught my manager joking about me being his girlfriend with the kitchen staff and later that night after work he asked me if he can drop me off at home i replied that i would be taking uber but the fact that he asked me that and none of the other server all of whom were male made me feel uncomfortable is this usually how it is at restaurant or wa my manager acting unprofessional
this wa a while back but i ll never forget it i wa working a a lunch server for a new at the time restaurant at an amusement park this story revolves around a lady probably in her s who wa dining with her family and very not happy about the cook of her pita bread her family wa one of my first table of the day so i wa at the top of my customer service game they ordered and everything went normally the lady ordered pita bread and hummus a an appetizer no problem i send their order to the kitchen and i m told i have two new table i take my time greeting my new table knowing that our food runner would deliver the appetizer to my table i head back to send in my new order and my busser is looking for me he tell me that my table would like to speak to me a i begin my walk over to their table i see the lady standing by the food runner and she doe not look happy i walk up to them and she turn to look at me i noticed she s holding a piece of pita bread lady i can not believe you expect me to eat this me not knowing what she is talking about i m sorry wa their a problem with your food lady a problem this is inedible a she say this she hold out the pita bread to me i assume she is handing it to me and reach to take it she grab my hand and slap my hand with the pita bread after the third slap she say can you feel how hard this is this is unacceptable me still dumbfounded i will get you fresh pita bread right away and you will not be charged for your appetizer she just grunted and walked back to her table i just stood there for a bit before the food runner bust out laughing after a second i join in i could not believe what happened after telling my manager what happened he just laughed comped their appetizer and finished serving their table i asked my manager at the end of the shift and to no surprise no tip the funny thing is why me all i did wa take the order the chef cooked it and then the food runner dropped it off her slapping me with the pita bread wa the first time i had even seen it good time
allergy are no joke and should be taken very seriously however if you re gonna eat somewhere it shouldn t be the server job to reverse engineer every dish to accommodate your need this time for instance i had a two top of older woman they were very nice and even had me laughing after the drink order then came the food order and i really don t know what wa going through this woman s head i went by the table to see if they were ready and that s when citrus woman started her game i have an allergy to citrus and i have no idea what dressing have citrus and which one don t we have a lot of dressing so i had to narrow her search down but she proceeds to talk to her dinner guest for like minute about what she doe and doesn t like i then ask would you like a couple more minute which she of course responds with you see i have an allergy to citrus and have no idea what dressing have citrus and which one don t then my supervisor turn the corner and i recruit her help to which she stand there at this table for minute and come back to me with an order two of our most popular dish with absolutely no modification the citrus woman actually ordered what i had recommended so i guess she just love talking in circle for no reason please don t hold your server at the table for extended period of time we don t have time for it
this happened during our city s restaurant week obligatory not any longer a server walked into a restaurant that wa doing the restaurant week special three of u had been before and loved it one wa new for those who don t know during restaurant week place will have an optional set menu course usually here for a set price it s a chance for them to showcase specialty and attract new customer this particular establishment seat about ha a cool semi industrial vibe and american comfort food indian fusion cuisine that s to die for so it tends to be popular especially with the after work crowd when we arrived there were about people over table unfortunately that s when we discovered the hostess wa also the bartender and the only server the other no called no showed and this wa right at that weird sweet spot just before the happy hour crowd come in so it wa getting busy our waitress wa a frigging rockstar she wa sweet explained everything and wa completely unruffled sure we had to wait a bit to get drink and what not but it really didn t matter to say she wa busting her as wa an understatement hell she wa even bussing if she walked past a table that needed clearing and she had empty hand juuuust a the place started to fill up two other server made it in and the foh manager wa handling everything and anything that needed done to pick up the slack one of our group tends to be hard to please she s not a mildred karen with an aarp card but she s particular about food and service having done both she walked out singing our server s praise and planning for the next trip back so to all of you who are out there on the front line thank you we see you we appreciate the hell out of everything you do thank you and yes she got a tip and we made sure to tell the manager how amazing our server wa that praise is also going into the yelp google review
i ve worked in hotel for year now so i ve got a few one story i remember is from when i wa still fairly new i had a line at check in and wa trying to get everyone processed and up to their room a quickly a possible enter entitled guest eg eg immediately walk past the or so people standing before him to say he wa there to check in i told him i d be with him in a moment a i had to check in the people in the queue that s when he pulled his status and mentioned he should be helped first we didn t have a separate area for elite guest so i politely informed him i would be with him a soon a it wa his turn after he check in he asks about the luggage cart we only had which were both in use at the time but i offered to have someone assist him with his thing and that a cart should be down shortly apparently that wasn t good enough for him and he decided to carry all of his belonging in one shot and dropped a bottle of champagne in the parking lot he cane to the desk absolutely furious demanding we pay for it since it wa our fault he couldn t properly bring his item in i comped him a beer since that s all i could do and sent him on his way a few hour roll around and again im checking people in when eg stumble in the front door and he lean over the front desk and demand i pour him a drink i inform him in assisting guest and if he d like to wait by the bar i could help him whenever i m done he get big mad because he s an elite guest and shouldn t have to wait since he s better than these people absolutely not sir i again tell him that he can go take a seat by the bar and i can help him in a minute while waiting at the bar he proceeds to start playing with a little odds amp end tray we kept for people who forgot thing like tooth brush razor etc literally clanking them all around while huffing and puffing about having to wait since this man wa already obliterated i consult with another coworker about how i didn t feel comfortable serving him and wanted a second opinion she agreed that even if we didn t serve him initially we both didn t feel like he should be having any more and making u liable for anything that might happen i walk over the the bar and inform the guest that while i didn t feel comfortable serving him anything to drink i would be more than happy to make him something off our menu and give it to him at no charge mother fucker doesn t even say anything just get a huge grin on his face and walk off to the elevator not too long after we get a call from a couple in the room across from his saying hey so we don t really like to complain but there s a naked man running up and down the hallway and he just peed all over our door sent someone upstairs to find him but unfortunately we couldn t find him and we had no way to prove it wa him but it s safe to assume it wa him moved the couple to a new room and got slapped with a bill from ecolab
something i overheard on accident wa the cook they were talking while i wa like cleaning tray or something and didn t know i could hear but said the following hey we need to make sure we re putting out good dish we may make the same no matter what but u doing good mean the server make more they work their ass off and deserve good tip so the least we can do is send these dish out best a possible it wa so sweet and so wholesome i loved hearing that
anyone else have dream of them serving i work at a restaurant where we have a bar right in the middle closed off from the rest of the restaurant but i always have dream actually more like nightmare where i m serving and i m in the weed i would get them a lot when i first started serving about year ago and rarely do i have them now but i wa just thinking about it my dream don t necessarily look the way the restaurant doe but similar to it and i always have anxiety like i can feel it in my sleep am i working too much lmao doe anyone else have dream like this
sunday night are usually pretty busy for me but last night wa so above and beyond that i got a migraine that i still haven t recovered from i rarely get migraine i had to leave hour into my shift and let someone else pick up to go because my migraine wa getting worse our store refuse to implement a system that pause the store if there are too many order placed within a time frame or if our kitchen is behind on dine in order so my counter get congested really quickly and the pick ups get irate when their order aren t ready because today wa a holiday i worried that i would either have a stroke or aneurysm while at work i do not get paid enough for this shit
now i want to say i take full accountability for my action and i am not making excuse for them but i also want to make sure i am not overthinking it amp x b i posted a few week back that i have been dealing with a transphobic coworker at the place i used to work he insists on referring to me a he it or a faggot or tranny i reported him several time and we have even got into argument i wa told right before i started by my gm while i support you and who you are he is an asset to the team and ha been here longer and i don t care what his view are i will always side with him anyway about two week ago i wa let go by this place the saturday night i wa the closer and this girl wa super drunk and kept ordering drink she wasn t tipping me at all and she wa being belligerent to me and the mod and kept coming up to me while i am at my table i complained about her to one of my friend at the bar and one of the regular overheard me again i take accountability for it i shouldn t have been venting where customer could hear me amp x b anyway i show up to the shift monday and i wa told i wa being let go because of that bitching about a customer and the regular reported it to the owner amp x b what bother me is the coworker i mentioned before i have reported to the owner management five time in total had never really been reprimanded and i wa fired because i spoke ill of a customer again if that is the reasoning i am fine but the whole entire time i had been working there i always felt i had to be percent because they couldn t t not hire me for being trans but part of me feel like they were looking for a reason to get rid of me i did my job well i had several regular asking for me in the month i worked there and i have had several star review which one of the manager said wa amazing because they had been struggling with review i ge my action but it just make me wary
tonight wa a good one i got to meet our new operation manager old one got fired for being an idiot i got to sing in an impromptu karaoke competition in the lobby and i got to eat for free but the best thing sometimes come from the most mundane source tonight while working the desk i had a group of three older lady come in looking for a room they came in looking for a room for three woman and they were a bit shaken up they d showed up to their airbnb which they d reserved month before only to find it occupied by a bunch of pot smoking teenager they didn t feel safe at their airbnb so they came to my schmoliday out looking for a place to stay i put them in one of our corner room with two queen and a pull out and they were good about minute later one of the anti karen came down asking if they could extend their stay at our hotel i verified that they could and kept the aaa rate that i d given them since they d suffered enough from airbnb she wa super thankful more than i expected given what they d been through after she left i realized i d forgotten to tell them the updated cost so i called up and let them know of the updated cost with the discount and they debated for all of two second before calling down to tell me they d be taking it i locked it in told them we can split between multiple card at check out and bid them good night before i hung up i heard someone in the background call me an angel i can t say i didn t blush that wa the pick me up i needed after getting bitched out five time last night so for those wondering in my few experience with canadian it seems like it s true they ve been some of my nicest guest
the title say it all minus the context of course but this happened just second ago while i wa literally just scrolling through this subreddit a i do during every shift i have with nothing to do during the current slow hour i ve been working at my property for nearly year at this point my mother also work here in breakfast and ha been for over year at this point we also have this new woman d who just started working here at the front desk she s a lot older and talk way too much my biggest pet peeve when working with someone else on a super slow shift earlier she came in to pick up her check didn t even work today and wa waiting around in lobby since they haven t come in yet from accounting from our sister property she go to the breakfast area to talk to my mom about her new car after also telling me about it and taking me outside to show it off ok she come back to the front desk after about minute to continue talking about her car then out of nowhere amp gt d don t take offense but i just talked to your mom back there and asked if you were gay me amp gt d haha i just figured i ask to be sure me amp gt d you know i just saw the piercings and i know how the guy do their eyebrow i have ton of gay friend so it s okay if you were to be fair it s not uncommon for me to get that i m young finishing up college i have a couple ear piercings on either side one of them being dangly a nose stud and i pluck my eyebrow regularly and i get haircut but it shouldn t even matter if i wa gay or not it wa just so out of nowhere and bold ok boomer she followed up by asking what s that word for you guy who do your eyebrow and dress nice and stuff to which i replied i m not sure i knew she wa thinking of metrosexual but didn t want to bother explaining why men who groom themselves and are confident in how they dress and present themselves can simply be referred to a men who groom themselves and are confident in how they dress and present themselves but that s a convo for another day smh my gf would be heated edit ok boomer it s used jokingly but also not there are people who fit this stereotypical category of ignorance and close mindedness and this woman is one of them if you don t fit that category and are unable to see past the irony then clearly it doesn t apply to you and you shouldn t take offense thanks
this is not a story well kinda but not i live in a town that ha alot of military i work in a bar restaurant so obviously if someone is ordering alcohol i must id we only give military discount on food no alcohol when they give me their id most of the time it s a military id so obviously i should put a military discount right wrong we a the server do not have access to discount they must be done by a manager sometimes there are night where the manager on duty is super busy because sometimes that manager is the bartender it s not that i m lazy it s just that i hate standing at the bar waiting for the bartender to get a second to come put a fucking military discount on a meal it s which in turn if i m super busy put me behind on all the other stuff i need to do and when the id they show me is military it should be obvious that i give them a military discount right i do not put military discount unless they literally ask me to put a military discount am i an asshole or do other server do this a well

so this happened at a former hotel where i worked the hotel ha the name loft in it and that is important to the story so our door lock at pm and there were two night auditor on at the time i wa the newest of the bunch so i usually followed suit with what the other auditor did on shift they were both awesome it is am and a guy knock on our front door and mitch not real name talk to him through the speaker he want to rent a room but look like he is either a pimp or a drug dealer mitch tell him that it is a night and we require a matching photo id and a credit card hoping this may deter the guest from our location the guest say not a problem so mitch hesitantly let him in following shortly is the guest girlfriend she pipe up and say for that much money i better be getting a suite with a jacuzzi tub mitch doe not know what to say because we only have loft style room i see the confusion on mitch s face so i step up and say i am sorry we only have loft style room we do not have any jacuzzi tub in any room the boyfriend did not care so he is still waiting for mitch to process everything the girlfriend reply you have to be kidding me i retort no i am not kidding hense the name of the hotel loft she say that is we are not staying here let go and the couple left and we did not have to do the after audit check in which is a pain the nor did we have to worry about what kind of trouble would those guest cause at am in the morning
h la everyday hero sorry formating phone hour shift beer happily digested and english second language worked year in restaurant up north in europe and usually new people are first trained server then graduate either bartender or host and both position i find more taxing than server strictly speaking competance and skill level but from reading alot of story i get the impression most start with hosting why is that while writing i think maybe coming from a very sosialist society where all tip is split equally depending on work hour among all in other culture the server have an more important role anyhie been thinking about that one for a while
asshole manager here again i honestly do not enjoy writing people up or letting people go but i m at a point where i need to be consistent and fair with everyone earlier this week i had to let an employee go for chronic tardiness with several documented conversation this person could not show up to work by roughly to minute with each occurrence after repeated counseling they were let go their best idea wa to leave a shitty review on yelp even though i know i ve told them i dont care about what people say there anyway this is a long and verbose way to ask what doe it get to take you a restaurant server to leave a negative review on another restaurant edit no change i wa just drunk during typing

this did not happen to me but to my coworker and i just got to watch the video after here is the cast fd front desk coworker my bos and is very sweet ol older lady in her s very heavy set om old man in his late s in a wheel chair bg amp amp very nice guy who happened to be black and got the shit end of the stick fd is sitting at the desk minding her own business when in walk ol pushing om they come up to the desk to check in and immediately begin launching into this story ol they re after u they ve got all our stuff and they re after u fd obviously alarmed who s after you ol they are it s two black guy in a yellow truck they re after u and don t you tell them we are here fd is a little perturbed by this but she informs ol that because of our security policy we cannot confirm the presence of any guest after she get them checked in she tell them that a long a they go to their room and stay there no one will ever know they re there ol seems complacent with this and push om down the hall to their room minute later ol come back down the hall pushing om wearing nothing but a string bikini and flip flop she s well over ilbs and the bikini is not her size i m all for body positivity wear a bikini if you want just make sure it s the right size she roll om into the lobby and begin flopping down on our furniture leg spread wide before jumping up and flopping down again over and over she s obviously very agitated and the entire time she s talking about how these people are after her they have her stuff they re trying to get them at this point fd think there may be a mental component at play here and try to get ol and om to go back to there room so we don t have to call the authority to intervene because with behavior like this ol must obviously be crazy right wrong not even minute into fd trying to get them to go back to their room a big yellow penske moving truck come flying into the parking lot slam on break and jitter to a halt by our door two younger black gentleman get out and come inside the moment the door open ol begin shrieking ol pointing finger and screeching that s them they re the one they re after u bg walking toward them and also yelling nuh ugh lady you crazy you know you did u wrong you know you owe u money bg walk to the front desk to explain while bg and ol go at it and om get riled up in his chair apparently the couple hired the guy to pack up their house load the moving truck and drive them from one state over and to our current location they did all of this without negotiating a set amount for payment and worked on a pay u what you think is far basis the guy worked for a little under hour and still had to drive the penske truck back the couple thought wa more than fair for the two men to split they disagreed and the rest of the story ensued the guy refused to give the couple there thing and the couple refused to pay them more but the guy had no use for all the couple s thing s so they were fallowing them around trying to get more money by this point fd tell everyone they need to get the hek out of the lobby with this they could fight it out anywhere else they wanted just not in the lobby but the fight is too far gone at this point and fd get up in time to om rear back and punch bg in the hip police get called fighting ensues until they get there and the police finally sort it all out the black guy get the short end of the stick because they stated to the police that they didn t negotiate a set amount first and that meant they had to accept what wa given to them and leave or be arrested for theft amp amp harassment it wa pretty messed up but they got to take comfort in knowing ol and om were kicked out of the hotel for misconduct
i spent three year working at a well known hotel chain in the south of england half a decade or so back i d like to say that it wa a wonderful job with wonderful people but unfortunately it wa a highly stressful one with generally mediocre to sub par work colleague gave me some good story though to get warmed up let me tell you the story of builder bob bob wa one of the many construction site worker who wa booked in en masse by the various company during the week by and large i didn t tend to have much trouble with the construction site mob a a rule they would come in late usually drunk on their first night there and then collapse straight into bed from exhaustion sometimes they wouldn t even make it that far i found a chap face down in the hallway more than once but for the most part they didn t cause much trouble for reception just the odd noise request now and then bob however wa a cheeky bugger he came down one day to ask for more teabags seeing the giant box full under the reception counter that we had to give on the spot replenishment from bob s eye went wide and his greediness went into overdrive after that bob would come for replenishment on a regular basis twice a day like clockwork amp x b but not for his room no he would bring a plastic bag and empty dozen of teabags milk and sugar into it each time i m not sure if he wa building a stash he took home or just supplying other people at the construction site or both but bob wanted his tea supply en masse and would take the piss a much a possible if that were it he d be nothing more than a cheeky rogue unfortunately bob it seemed wa a bit of a letch he had a habit of trying to hit on the female reception staff badly which given he wa about forty five fat and balding wa le than pleasant he also spent ten minute once whilst extremely drunk trying to hassle me into telling him where the best local whorehouse wa when turned down flat heproceeded to go off on a very descriptive fantasy about what he d like to do to the various other receptionist from the day i handed in my two week notice i took great pleasure in telling bob that no he could no longer have whatever tea top ups he pleased a he wa taking the piss he blustered and threatened to complain to my manager after six shift he stopped trying i m told the rest of the staff carried on from where i started and he wa ejected permanently three week after i left for shouting sexist thing at one of the lady who refused to let him fill his bag what a gem our builder bob wa
can we just talk about how when you are working an incredibly busy shift doing the job of different people and you don t have time for management s shit last night i wa serving a busy saturday night i got sat with a top top and a top then wa sat with a top all within a minute of each other i don t have a busser food runner and the bartender wa useless the kitchen wa late to push out food the bartender wasn t making my drink i wa doing a damn fine job i had my flow i had my course of action planned out it wa going great everyone had what they needed in a timely manner then the owner step in tell me to change my course of action offer them their free salad before the apps come out i planned my time for my salad to come out after the apps not before so she make me reroute myself to go to the top and ask if they want their salad before the apps they say yes i tell her i just don t have the time to make and dress salad she look like she s going to rip my head off she said they ve been waiting too long i mention how they specifically requested that they not be rushed they even said we will drink for an hour before our meal the owner didn t care then on my way back to the salad station from the table i get buzzed for my apps so i have to bring the apps out and now i look bad at my table for making it seem like they re apps wouldn t be out yet they took so long eating all their little apps that the other server stole my salad and used them for themselves great fantastic then the owner start pushing me on my other table rushing the bill and the dessert the other table see how busy i am and tell me they are in no rush and that they are perfectly fine with their after dinner coffee everyone is conversing and laughing and having a great time no one is waiting an unreasonable time they all want to sit and enjoy each other s company she rush the bill for my other smaller table throwing me through a loop and changing my course of action again causing me to fall behind if you make me do something that you think is first priority when there is something else i should be doing that really is first priority that you aren t considering because you aren t actually serving then you are messing everything up she dropped the check on my table without adding their info to the bill then persecuted me for it not being on there already then one table wanted their bill split so i had to double back to split their check i m in the middle of doing that and she know i have a birthday card money off their check and a gift card on the other split half before i even split their bill she add them on but the po is shot and and it didn t effectively split their bill so it all got jumbled up then instead of giving the gift card back with the remaining balance on it she thought she d save herself time by just offering the rest of the gift card in cash from my own bank i tell her i don t have a bank because there wa no time to get one from the moment i walk in the door so she s mad at me and she s holding me up this entire time by making me do this while everyone else really is not in a rush so the whole check got completely messed up whatever i m over it at this point i m not showing her that i m mad but i m also not being apologetic because it s really just messing up my flow completely all the time i m spending trying to communicate with her what i really nerd to do with my table i could be doing something else more important then i start making a tray of salad finally because the other server stole the one i made and this other server come up and literally start stealing the salad directly off the tray i m in the process of making oh not to mention earlier she accused me of stealing the salad i made for myself too i wa just about ready to rip her head off at this point she is a known thief a lot of time she will straight up steal the bread basket i make for myself a well so we make bread basket place them on a tray and leave them at the bar so the bartender can put the drink in our tray and we can bring them both to the table she always steal the one i make for myself over it so now i m doubling back again because i m making salad for myself and she s taking them off my tray for herself over it i told her to put them back i m just so sick of everyone wasting time oh and the kitchen the kitchen will buzz me when i didn t have food up so i d go into the kitchen to see what they have to update me on and no one s saying anything they re just standing there not looking up to tell me so the whole night i wa going what what what what did you buzz me for waiting a solid minute and a half for them to tell me what would take them second to say it s like you think that no one worked in a restaurant before that shift
i heard from three separate former co worker who are still in the business that some people are just now trying to make vd reservation and being huge asshole because they can t be accommodated anyone else experience this
so i get called in early to work a i m hanging out with family because a coworker called in again and since i can t say no i said ok sure no problem i should have said no when i arrived at pm i wa scheduled to work the night shift i wa greeted by cop and my coworker who explained that some guy wa kicked out by this friend and the guy drunk wa trying to retrieve his stuff from that room aside from that trope we were down to room and nearly sold out in the middle of dealing with the cop and that drunk my manager called and said to open up room that had minor maintenance issue and to sell them at a discount my coworker wa dealing with that drunk with the cop but i wa still posting checkins etc under her shift because it wa so hectic by the time she logged out we sold those opened maintenance room and my bos wa like wow open these others too but i had to inspect them first to make sure they were rentable fine however besides that drunk there were other drunk and i wa getting noise complaint etc while dealing with all that i managed to check the room my bos said to open and out of were rentable which went within min during that time that drunk reappeared on property with additional drunkmates and i called the cop again to file a no trespass order against that drunk the shift had changed apparently with the cop because the one who showed up had no idea of the call before so i said x x this x that x and they scribbled appropriately and left they managed to get that drunk off property without filing a no trespass order in the confusion my coworker before me switched a double bed room due to a complaint and soon after we got a rd party reservation for a double bed room when we didn t have one so i called my bos and guess what he said open up x room from maintenance it should be okay up to that point i had checked all opened maintenance room to make sure they were rentable but on the assurance of my bos and the volume of thing i wa dealing with i opened the room and checked them in without checking the room first huge mistake admittedly on my part the bed in the room were clean but had plumbing issue so whoever maintenance wa dealing with it opted to throw towel in the bathroom rather than deal with the issue because we were so oddly busy and the steep discount we offered for these opened maintenance room the guest opted to stay throughout that night i wa getting noise complaint and most were dealt with when i called the room however i got several from one room a i wa running around the hotel and when i went to check it wa that drunk and when he opened the door a blast of weed smoke hit me so i said keep it down pretended i wa his friend left then called the cop again and waited until they showed up he wa arrested finally by that time it wa nearly time for me to do audit am at my property so i get that completed i had about an hour of peace around am one of that drunk comrade show up while dealing with that drunk earlier when he wa carted off to jail his friend the one who showed up at am wa escorted to a sobering house by the cop and he lay a story on me at which point i ask for id and he ha a room with u but doesn t know it so i give him a key and he leaf then return a minute later saying his key isn t working when guest say that i ask what color did the light on the door flash when you inserted the key because red mean an error green mean it ll open and orange mean it s dead bolted i wa not surprised when he said orange we proceed to his room and i knock in case anyone will open no answer i knock again and hear a bit of noise so i wait i hear the bolt being retracted etc then out stumble this mid aged woman onto our courtyard who proceeds to take a piss on herself i m so annoyed at this point that i leave and tell the guy to deal with it and if i hear any complaint i will just ring our best friend the cop i finish up the rest of my work and at i get a frantic call from a room that some disabled lady they helped out the night before wa screaming all night and banging on their door their room were adjoining and i needed to deal with it immediately i go to the room in question and the woman ha fallen out of her wheelchair ha deep red watery eye and ha soiled herself and i assumed drunk but it could have been a host of thing i tell her to remain calm and i will call for help at which point the other room husband walk out and start yelling at me about how all night they were dealing with this and at that point i didn t really care anymore and asked forcefully why they didn t call me earlier and they said they had and i said bullshit this is a medical emergency and if you had any knowledge of it and didn t report it earlier which they didn t there maybe an issue for them the paramedic arrived shortly after and cleared the soiled lady she wa just another drunk a i waited for the paramedic i got treated to several round a the mod stood watch of the incompetent neighbor laying out their corporate complaint strategy if anyone think hotel front desk is easy prepare yourselves for day like this which may or may not happen

hi everyone i work at a casual fast food pizza place the kind where you build your pizza subway style and we cook it for you one day about a month ago i wasn t feeling too hot i wa exhausted mentally and emotionally drained and just came back after recovering from a sinus infection i wa in no mood to communicate with customer so i hung by the oven to cook the pizza it wa quieter warm and i could zone out for a bit while i waited for the food to cook a family of three came in and it wa a typical interaction but my coworkers and i got a bit uncomfortable when the father gave his name we take customer name so we can call them when the food is ready but instead of giving his actual name the man said baby daddy now this wasn t a huge deal since at the time they were the only one in the restaurant and they were in a group so we only needed to call out one of their name and hand all three pizza off we are also allowed to not call name if we aren t comfortable can t pronounce them etc so we all agreed we weren t going to play along with this guy i wa zoning out while waiting for my coworkers to finish building their pizza so i could start cooking the gentlman noticed this and said you can smile you know it s not against the law i heard him talk but since i wa in my head what he said didn t click i gave him a quick smile and even laughed a bit just to be polite since he wa looking right at me there you go he said that s better i wa confused it didn t set in until a minute or two later what he actually said to me i wa even more confused and felt really uncomfortable i wasn t feeling well a it wa and i m not required to smile at customer unless i m directly interacting with them i told my bos what happened and he told me to let him know if he did or said anything else luckily that wa the end of it but when their pizza were done his daughter told my coworker to call out her father s name since my coworker called out the daughter and mother s name my coworker told her she wasn t comfortable with that and the daughter got angry and walked away in a huff overall it wa a weird uncomfortable situation probably not the greatest story but i still think about it a lot it wa my first experience with being told to smile and my first experience being super uncomfortable while at work they haven t come back since thankfully and my bos wa supportive of how we handled everything edit i said so in comment and it s probably obvious but i feel like it s worth noting that i m female my two coworkers in the story are female a well

let me preface this by saying i work the front desk at a historic hotel old wiring just about every room is a little different and i am not a maintenance guy called about an issue with their tv ok no problem let me come up and take a look for you boy wa i wrong first the remote wasn t working which is a pain but something i know how to fix so cool remote s fixed but it s still showing no signal k let make sure everything is plugged in oh i see it s the hdmi cable that s not plugged in huh someone must have needed it for something no big deal hdmi is plugged in but there s still no signal weird it look like the cable box isn t plugged in who would have unplugged this it s behind the fireplace surely there are outlet that are easier to access whatever ok everything is plugged in now all the status light are on let go ahead and try this again still no signal ugh i m going to go steal a cable box from i don t like that room so i m not putting anyone in there anyways plug in new box still no signal the only thing i haven t checked yet is the wall plug for the cable now where is that it must be around this stupid fireplace like everything else right oh nope it s not ok i see the cable oh good it go along the wall and into the carpet that s a good sign finally i found the actual wall plug in gently nestled behind the coffee table and chair yeah that s a good spot no one will ever bump that accidentally i unplugged unscrewed the cable from the wall and immediately realized that wa a mistake the male end of the cable that s in the wall is totally loose and just resting on the face plate so when i went to plug it back in the cable just kind of turtled back into the wall never to be seen from again not on my watch please excuse me while i go find a screwdriver i wa not going to let this thing win so i go out to the maintenance closet that s next door to they ve got some gizmo in there there must be a screwdriver how is there no screwdriver in this goddamn closet fine i ll make do with this box knife i got back into the room took the face plate off and managed not to cut myself which is quite a feat if you know me i fished mr shy guy out of the wall and after futzing around with the thing for a couple minute i finally got it reconnected and remounted the face plate we turned on the t v annnnnd success there s a signal and i m outta here oh i definitely left s cable box in a small price to pay for victory
our parking can be confusing it s a structure beneath the hotel but you enter right outside the lobby when looking at it it almost look like the garage would be hidden inside the building so if you don t know you need to go down upon entering if can be incredibly confusing we also share it with an office building on the same block so if you re not paying attention you ll end up in the office building when you come up i always try to tell people a plainly and clearly a i can and of the time a long a they re listening there s no problem at all and they thank me for the good direction but every now and then i get some arrogant douche who just walk away when i m in the middle of my monologue about how to park i get it they ve been in the car for hour and just want to get upstairs but if they decide to opt out of the direction them getting lost is entirely their fault one guy last night did exactly that walked away after i gave him the key and ignored me when i tried to tell him i needed to show him where to park i just say fuck it and go back to the desk preparing for him to come back furious that he couldn t find it sure enough i get a phone call from him it s late at night so the office building is closed he s standing by their elevator wondering why it s not working i try to tell him but he s of course just fuming about how he ll never stay here again he s saying shit about how a maliott property should never make their guest stand outside like this and that i should buzz him in immediately i tell him he s at the wrong elevator so i can t do that but of course it go right over his head eventually he shuts up and let s me explain he make it to the correct elevator and when he walk through the lobby he just continued to curse and demand for the manager business card lol what can the manager do is she supposed to be able to facilitate the demolition and complete redesign of our property just so this asshole can find the parking easier next time
i worked for a brewery slightly upscale restaurant it wa late afternoon just before am pm shift change a slightly older couple maybe late s early s come in they sit in my section and go straight to the menu i introduce myself which they have little interest in the husband order a coke and the wife a water i grab the drink return and ask if they re ready they respond with we ve barely looked at the menu annoying but not a problem considering it s relatively slow after about minute i return to the table to take an order the wife asks me why we don t have a tomato basil pasta dish on the menu that she saw online i explained to her i know the dish she wa describing but it ha since been taken off our menu maybe month prior she went on to tell me how she recently became vegan and saw an article online about this dish and came there specifically for it fun fact about this dish the tomato basil sauce wa made with cream and it also wa made with prosciutto so not at all vegan i told the woman however that i had good news for her we were one of the only location to have created a fully vegan menu and i would be more than happy to bring that and discus her option she wa not happy about that answer she insisted she came here for only that item and that the article she read said we would have it and she even saw a picture of what it looked like i asked if she could show me the article so i could understand where she wa coming from she pulled out her phone and showed me the first thing i noticed wa the article wa from year prior when the item first hit the old menu and the nd wa that the picture shown wasn t even of our food at this point i realize i should have tried to get my manager but i ll get to that in a second i explained to her the article wa outdated and the food shown wasn t ours but that seemed to infuriate her she stood up and got in my face claiming i have been nothing but rude and dismissive of her and her husband and they would be leaving i tried to apologize if i came off that way i wa sorry but she said i didn t mean it and demanded to see my manager which i said i would grab him i went looking in the office the kitchen the back bev station the closed dining room and the brewery this man wa nowhere to be found the woman start shouting for me asking where he is and i say i m trying to find him a i am rushing through the building she storm out with his business card from the front and my manager come out from the employee bathroom seemingly taking a very long and inconvenient dump this woman writes in the next day saying how rude and unhelpful and arrogant i wa when all she wanted wa a simple dish she looked forward to trying i re explained everything to him but he gave me a write up anyway saying i should have gotten him involved i don t know what could have been done differently tl dr a woman wanted something we didn t have i tried to help her a much a i could she wouldn t accept my help my manager wa too busy pooping to get involved and then blamed me and wrote me up for the whole situation

last night one of my manager my coworkers and i went to another japanese restaurant to celebrate one of our boh worker s birthday manager wa paying for all of u we went to this restaurant because some of the boh staff at this restaurant also work at our restaurant either on a different day or during lunch shift the restaurant we went to is only open at night a it is an izakaya place our server got u started with water right away and then it went downhill from there our server wa nowhere to be seen most of the waitstaff were japanese speaker and my manager being the only japanese speaker among u kept trying to flag down in japanese for someone to take our order probably minute had passed at this point the birthday person asked for coke and one of my coworkers asked for toro sashimi toro is like the fatty part of a tuna but both of them never got what they asked for nobody ever checked on u a dish that none of u ordered wa put on our table and left there until my manager flagged a server down to tell them it wa a tofu dish and while i m the only vegetarian there i know that i didn t order it because i actually typed on my phone a small list of what i wanted to order and tofu wa not on that list nobody else ordered tofu one of my coworkers also ordered ramen but instead of asking who ordered ramen or putting it in front of her provided they use seat number but considering it wa an izakaya restaurant this is unlikely they just set the ramen on the edge of the table and left my coworker had to literally get out of her seat to go grab her bowl of ramen to put this into perspective we were sat at a seater table the only table large enough to accommodate our party this coworker wa sitting at one of the middle seat she had to get up and walk past me and a few other people to get to the edge of the table where her ramen wa and then pas u again to return to her seat the food wa really good but the service not so much when i asked for a togo container for one of my food i also wanted to order dessert mochi ice cream but the server who my manager noted wasn t even the same person who took our food order just started to walk away after i requested a togo container so i had to loudly say that i also wanted to order dessert in addition to my request for a takeout box my manager again he wa paying didn t even want to leave an additional tip on top of the automatic gratuity because of all that wa my manager in the right to not add an additional tip here he mentioned that if we had actually gotten service he would ve left an additional tip on top of the gratuity but he and my coworkers felt the service wa bad though because automatic gratuity wa added there wa no tip line on the receipt i wa sitting across from my manager so i could see what it looked like just a line to sign your name oh and it wa nowhere even close to closing hour they close at am we arrived at pm and left at pm and due to there being a confirmed case of the coronavirus being in the county i live in the restaurant wasn t a busy a it usually is

hi r talesfromthefrontdesk this is my very first post on your fine subreddit i work in an unnamed australian boutique hotel that is owned by a company that owns everything around the last minute of my shift i wa checking in a few guest under a booking where the arrival note were listed a owner of x big hotel concealed for privacy reason i had noticed that their room wa quite low in the building about half way down whose error this wa doe not bother me i am a dickhead and i put the top tier owner level membership in an accessible room higher up than what they had been roomed initially i had a complete brain snap and neglected to search for a bigger the only bigger room type for them i had completely forgot that room ending in the same number between floor x x were accessible a i went up the elevator and hit the floor i arrived at the door to be met with two view porthole one at waist and one at head height to shamefully hand over their new room key to the bigger room type i should have put them in anyway it wa a good laugh and learning experience to say the least tell u your similar story of personal failure to deliver service to those you were meant to turn on for
y all i ve about had it with fully grown men throwing temper tantrum in our lobby whether it be because i can t put them right next to their family on a full occupancy day or because we had to put them in the identical room next to the one they wanted i have to bite my tongue to keep from telling them i know year old that are better behaved than them so this guy come in and according to the morning shift he had gotten upset because the candle in our wall sconce were not actual candle and didn t have a scent he then made a creepy statement about the young front desk girl needing to wear perfume for him instead the next day this guy request his room to be serviced but he ha to be in the room and it ha to be a certain housekeeper that he had met in the elevator earlier our front desk supervisor give a firm no to that one seeing a he had followed this housekeeper around all day and had just been generally predatory to several young girl that work at the hotel since his arrival well since this guy didn t get his way he decides to leave despite telling the housekeeper that he wa flying out tomorrow it s around pm and he come up to the front desk and say that he is leaving and that we shouldn t charge him i inform him of our late checkout policy which ha a cut off of pm and only then for elite member a most hotel do and since he had not even given u notice about this late checkout he will be charged after much insistence on his end i end up calling the office manager who of course say to charge him for the night the guest ha now left and asked to be called after i spoke to a manager i call him let him know that we ll be charging him and he go off about seeing the housekeeper still cleaning room and that they can just clean his room it not even dirty well the housekeeper are checking their last room and no we will not clean your room just so you won t be charged you can talk to management in the morning it ll be too late then you ll have already charged me he say well yes i say a that s the point and then he say well you re unpleasant aren t you and it s all i can do to keep from laughing at him right then and there i panic and say yep thank you and after a moment of silence click he hang up probably not my finest moment of customer service but my management thought it wa hilarious now i will make exception for people who have extenuating circumstance or a good rapport with the hotel this man ha been nothing but a creepy asshole why the hell would he think that we would break policy for him the absolute numpty i m not going to grovel at your foot because the truth is we don t want you we don t want you to come back in fact please don t i later spoke to the housekeeper that he had been creeping on and she said he told he that he is a hedge fund manager it all make sense now this definitely isn t the wildest of my story but it pretty much sum up the daily interaction i have with people i m not sure they realize that we mostly just laugh at how obscenely stupid they are

i love valentine s day it s a pleasant and an easy night a although you may be fully booked a you are seating only couple not group or family you only have half the number of guest i have one dining room with table designed for people normally seat at least on valentine s day that room ha couple in it so only guest a i say it s a great night and one i really enjoy but not the most profitable p s we do try to compensate by making a special menu which encourages people to spend a little more than our usual per head revenue edit i posted this because i overheard our local know it all village gossip saying how we must make a fortune on valentine s day
i literally just got hired at this place i am relatively new to the serving world so i didn t think to ask the question about what a normal night in sale is like i showed up tuesday for my first day of training and to me it wa slow i am used to table section and this restaurant had table total i figured since i would be taking order and running my own food that this would be a decent sized section well they were so overwhelmed they sent me home because they couldn t train me properly with how busy it wa the dishwasher said he ha never seen the restaurant so busy before in all the year he ha been there there were only of the table full so basically it s dead all the time i m supposed to come back this evening to train but i need to call and let them know it just isn t happening i should have done some research and asked better question during the interview they are a really sweet family owned business but i have to be able to pay my bill and no way in hell will i be walking away with more than or buck a night on top of the buck an hour base rate that they pay i thought this wa going to be a great fit a i wa trying to get out of the corporate world but it just isn t i m really scared of making them upset and i am awful at having tough conversation but i need to grow up and start doing that instead of just not showing up even worse is that an older lady in my aa group is neighbor with the owner and she told me when i got hired that they have a really tough time keeping employee that they ve tried to retire and no one want to work there so now i know that little tidbit and it make me feel even worse i am feeling like a massive c word right now i had a weird feeling in my gut so i continued interviewing which lead me to my second question amp x b q i had a first interview at a bar in downtown the agm wa really excited because the last few people she ha interviewed have had no experience she said she definitely want to get me in for a second interview with the gm who will make the final call but said they were trying to get someone hired asap for march madness and all the event coming up soon in denver this wa on tuesday afternoon and it s thursday now do i call at some point or do i just keep waiting i would really like to work there a they do in sale a night and are only open on the day i am available coincidentally amp x b amp x b
i wa working the morning shift and attending to breakfast when a guest called me over to our business center it s a computer and printer set up in the corner of the lobby he told me the computer wasn t working and i figured it just wasn t connected to the internet i make sure everything is working correctly including pulling up the google homepage before i let him know it s working fine and ask him what he wa trying to do he said he wa trying to print something from his gmail so i get him to the gmail login page and tell him to put his info in so i could help him get it printed the man stare at the screen for a moment before going well pull up my email i inform him that i can t do that because i don t know his login information only he know that he look up at me angrily and go so your computer doesn t work then do your job and fix it i again inform him that computer work fine all he ha to do is put in his login information we go around this circle a few more time before i tell him this isn t a problem i can help him with our computer is fine and unless he know his login information there is nothing i can really do i do however tell him if he ha access to his email through his phone he could forward the specific email to our front desk email and i could print it out from there the moment i step back behind the front desk he angrily jump up from the computer huffing his friend who were downstairs eating breakfast ask him across the room what s wrong to which he scream that bitch doesn t know the difference between her fucking as and hole in the goddamn ground his friend look shocked before looking at me who is also quite shocked looking back at him and telling him all of that wa unnecessary one of them did come up after the situation wa over to ask what happened and when i told them they just shook their head and apologized but it s too late for old buddy you best believe i kicked him out of the lobby with a quickness and told him if he couldn t conduct himself in a polite manner to our staff and could control his language in front of child there were family eating breakfast that i would have him completely removed from the premise and no he would not be refunded his room the guy left the lobby raging but i didn t hear a peep out of him for the rest of his stay i think his friend set him straight
a few year ago when i started something like out of people would come back to the front desk asking for another room or demanding a full refund thing like the tv won t turn on the ac wasn t working a window wa left open or that housekeeping hadn t even cleaned the room the housekeeper were not very conscientious about how they left the room and no one cared to update condition in the system it wa so frustrating because sometimes it wa all my fault and a one guest behaving badly so eloquently put it i would have to explain to the gm why i wa so stupid so after a week of this happening with seemingly every other guest i asked who check the room before guest arrive to make sure they are good no one that wa just how it wa let housekeeping sit on thier phone leave shit in the toilet and food in the fridge so i just took it upon myself to check to make sure the room were proper before arrival i d turn on a light set the ac to a cool temp and make sure the tv wa in fact plugged in the front desk employee that had been there for a couple year wa baffled what are you doing so i explained i would rather just make sure the room are in a condition i would want to check into if i wa spending a night then i took photo of before and after of how the in room amenity should be coffee and tea neat looking in the holder not just shoved in upside down and backwards the placard standing up and not face down and backwards the bath accessory neatly in a row and not you guessed it knocked over and backwards the staff did not like that i did this but the owner did and the out of ten people asking for another room hoping for a better situation dropped to zero no more people demanding a refund no more people getting upset at me for the room condition and thats how i put it to my co worker they were not the one getting yelled at and insulted and when people check into a room they expect certain thing like an empty fridge or say a clean toilet also so i didn t come off like a total jerk i would help when i could taking rubish out for them getting supply and bedding from the basement anything i could to help out i am not the bos and it s not my place to tell anyone else what to do but i do need clean proper room for people to check into in order for me to do my job well the gm didn t like my initiative either i wa wasting electricity by having ac heat light on would rather have people walk into a dark disgustingly hot possibly trashed room that hadn t even been touched by a maid i wa told you are the front desk your job is to just stand there and look pretty don t leave the desk to check room so i did till the complaint started coming up again brought it back up with the owner and the gm said she would be checking the room that happened for a few day so i kept it up myself well now it s winter and i ve been turning on the heat and today when i got to work i asked if the room rented were good the gm said yeah why aren t they marked clean in the system well i wa going to turn on a light and the heat and make sure the tv are plugged in gm stop doing that we are on a budget and if someone doesnt check in the light get left on and the heat is left on for week and nobody know the people will be fine they know where the light switch is they can figure out how to turn on the heat me so even when the room are freezing cold gm yes stop doing that it doesn t take that long for a room to heat up unless you want to be responsible for turning it off when they don t check in just leave it they ll be fine five minute later a room comped by the owner check in and two minute later they call down to the front desk comp room it is very cold in our room how do you get the heater to work the gm didn t say anything i shit you not yeah i ll just leave it
my wife and i went to melbourne australia for a weekend away recently and were lucky enough to be able to stay in a very expensive hotel in the middle of the city i know that you get what you pay for and that these kind of place are all about good customer service but i wasn t prepared for this we arrived around am knowing that check in isn t usually until pm asking if we could drop off our bag while we went out we had ticket to go and see harry potter and the cursed child at pm and wanted to grab something to eat before the show the amazingly helpful guy at the front desk told u that it wouldn t be a problem and we could actually check in straight away he then noticed that i had booked through a third party sorry and that i had left a note requesting a late check out if possible i explained that our return flight wasn t until pm the next day so he gave u until pm for check out usually am it wa such an amazing experience we don t often go away like this and pretty much never stay in a hotel that expensive but it really made the whole trip so much better
been a bit since i posted anything here and i just had the first drunk of the night you know the type you can hear them before they even make it to the door and can smell the alcohol before they reach the desk friendly enough but every question i answered wa responded with we love you breakfast hour they love me wifi info seriously this is getting uncomfortable i never should have suggested a weed courier service because frankly he love me like a son i think i might have been older than he wa i didn t bother to look luckily we are somewhat dead currently so i stuck them off in an emptier area and reminded them the no smoking rule also applies to marijuana amp x b well if that s the worst of tonight i m good have a great weekend everyone
just to recap i spent working for one of the largest hotel chain in the uk here in london warming up from round http www reddit com r talesfromthefrontdesk comment eqljxy fun time in the hotel suite today i m going to let those of you who don t work in the biz in on a little secret our hotel chain and i wa told the others all did the same thing routinely sold more room than we actually have it s called an overbooking policy and it s responsible for more staff and customer misery than almost anything else the way it work is very simple when checkin time on the day come first in is first served if we ve sold five more room than we have and all the room are full up by pm tough luck doesn t matter how far in advance you booked or how much you paid we ll have sold your room on to someone else every hotel in our chain had their own individual overbooking level which wa set centrally by a computer algorithm crunching how many no show we d previously had if we had an average of say three no show a night the online booking system would be willing to take booking for three more room than the hotel actually had which mean that if everyone who had paid for a room actually showed up that s when the problem began technically the hotel wa covered buried deep in the t amp c of the booking contract the company reserved the right to transfer their booking in the event that we felt like it but naturally you can t say that to an angry customer at half twelve so we d lie always oh a dog got in and shat all over the room yeah lighting hit the water tank on the roof and so the room below is uninhabitable there wa a murder there last night so the room is cordoned off for evidence whatever half plausible story we could concoct we d use because despite it being the t amp c it wa actually policy not to mention it to the customer unless you were actually forced to on top of which we sure a hell didn t want the abuse which would result from admitting we d sold their bedroom on to someone else but we wouldn t just give them a refund nonono we were supposed to call them a cab to the next nearest branch of the chain with spare room but here s the nub we weren t allowed to transfer the booking until the customer had actually showed up in case the room in the other branch were needed for a transfer from a third branch which meant that when they rolled in at whatever godforsaken early hour of the morning they d have to wait for u to call around other branch find a room call a cab and then journey there and thing never even ran that smoothly the minute that you realised you only had one or two room left you d immediately lie to anyone calling to ask if you had any spare the reason because whilst you could turn away walk in by saying you were full you lived in terror of a new online booking dropping through and taking you over your room count because you d given away your last surplus room to walkins or customer from another branch so every evening wa characterised with reception staff at different site lying to each other about how many room they had left i remember one evening when i told some little chavvy shit we were fully booked we actually were and he just stood back andbooked a room on his phone taking me over and i had to honour the booking because even though i d told him we were full and that he d be taking someone else s room he just didn t give a damn the customer themselves were almost always guaranteed to be pissed and fairly so driving all day and booked in a a stopover like hell do you want to drive elsewhere booked your room in anticipation of a business conference down the road of course you don t want to be sent to another site fifteen mile away got a bunch of tired kid exhausted from a day out you can bet your star they don t want to be pushed into a cab staff would try every trick to try and squeeze people in running upstairs yourself to scrub and clean a room from an early departure to prep it for a new arrival even though cleaning isn t your job check taking room offline in advance of big local event so you could bring them back online suddenly on the night check ringing regular customer in advance so you could try and get them to detour before you d even filled up check you say it someone tried it why all in a desperate effort to not have to deal with the sheer level of emotional stress and misery that this dumb fuck policy caused every staff member and late arriving customer
i ve waited a while to post this so some of the detail have been lost to time unfortunately tl dr a complainer get himself fired and a gossip get herself fired i m the night audit at an extended stay hotel near the headquarters of some major company and one of the decided to hire an outside contractor to help with some project or another this wa great for u and the contractor so there wa a lot of communication about how they would be booking our amenity and so on most of the people were angel never complained were friendly with staff didn t leave a huge mess absolutely perfect except for this one guy named richard but i ll shorten it to dick i met dick first because he would call every couple day at am our time to ask what i considered to be inane question about the pool and hot tub and room layout he seemed fine and the question were easy enough to answer everything seemed fine until check in dick somehow persuaded the fd to upgrade him to one of our nicer suite at the end of the hall a no no their contract wa very strict about available room type he wa the at the time highest elite mega status but these people were going to be here a while big no no dick had a houseman help him bring his luggage up and started to settle in all wa quiet except apparently to dick who called down an hour later with a noise complaint for the room above fd apologized profusely and passed along the complaint to the room another hour passsd and dick called again for a noise complaint for the same room per policy this time we went up to the room and told them if it happens again we get the cop involved except the room in question contained a young mom very apologetic who said her toddler had been playing quietly earlier but had already been put to bed all she d been doing the past half hour wa watching tv at what we could hear wa a reasonable volume hmmm i got on shift and all of this wa passed along to me so when he called down again at am with a third noise complaint i made an executive decision and offered him a room on the next and highest floor if there s no one above him no more noise complaint he hemmed and hawwed a bit and agreed to it but he insisted he needed someone to help him with his luggage it wasn t even yet the houseman wouldn t be in till and head housekeeper wa walking the hall to see if room have no service sign up welp time to go leave the desk unmanned for who know how long i guess to dick s credit he did tip me for helping to his discredit he spent the time handing me shirt to put on the cart and mansplaining about how tipping work now that dick had the scent for blood the complaint cam pouring in over the next two week the dresser is discolored in a small patch the closet door keep going off it track the cable internet isn t working properly the cable internet isn t working properly the cable internet isn t working properly we literally timed it over an hour and a half he called every five minute to ask when we would fix the cable internet dick would refuse to be put on hold and he would not except the only answer we could give him that the cable company had looked at the issue and were waiting for part to arrive the front desk girl went in the back and cried from the stress of having to deal with him and check in guest and all the other thing fd doe now all of that is super shitty and we were all getting pretty annoyed with him but technically it s all within ordinary guest behavior the letter if not the spirit of the law but remember dick wa not staying here alone he began complaining to his fellow coworkers about all of these issue and insisting that other hotel never had these problem in fact they should be offered the nice suite at the end of the hall he had one they all should be getting full turndown service every single day even though we tell them that isn t how we do it several people came forward complaining to the manager that they weren t recieving the benefit that dick wa and finally finally that wa enough our sale manager wrote to dick s parent company the contractor listed out everything that had been happening and asked if maybe they could do something about their employee if they could get him to not say shout at our poor front desk girl like he did for half an hour yesterday and to our surprise they did they told him he had two day to get his stuff packed and get home where they fired him holy shit now enter player one of our own agent of front desk carrie i don t remember how many of the shift listed above she worked not cry girl at least but through the two week he stayed here the shit wa spread pretty evenly he would complain to me a he left for work he would call am shift to whine throught the day and he would bitch out pm shift when he got back god forbid you worked weekend we of course talked about it amongst each other what he d done and what he d been egging on other people to do it wa easily the most drama we d had in a while and carrie sweet carrie not the sharpest tool in the toolshed literally took month and three people to train her when most of u managed with two week and one person but the nicest girl very friendly especially with the remaining contractor employee they d just had a big shake up one of their own had just gotten fired out of the blue and no one knew why oh but carrie knew why unluckily for carrie our higher ups were already scheduled to be in town the weekend after head of housekeeping heard her telling the contractor that we d gotten the man fired for complaining to much they let her finish out the week and quietly fired her and we all got a in person including me reminder to not to share confidential information with guest what the hell wa she thinking name have been changed for rule of funny edit changed william to richard because brain apparently forgot which one of those shortens to dick
tonight wa a night y all my bar supervisor came to the desk to warn me about a guest however the guest made it to me first she went off for minute about how she wa going to beat the bartender as for cutting her off after three drink ha sure that her ex husband is an ex nhl player whose a dead beat loser and doesn t pay his child support and that nobody appreciates her a a mother apparently i wa supposed to roll out the red carpet because shes a mom she kept going on about how nobody understand her life and her ex husband doesn t pay child support but then wa boasting about tip nightly at her job in the same statement in reality she wa making guest so uncomfortable they left the bar she wa aggressive toward everyone on staff screaming that we were mean nasty rude you name it she wa insanely inappropriate talking to guest about how she got a boob job and every morning when she take a shower she grab her tit and yell i love my titty that quote made it in the incident report whilst grabbing herself for dramatic effect we ended up calling the police after she came to the front desk and told me she wa going to beat my bartender s as and that she didn t care if we called the police she then proceeded to go back to the bar and start shouting at and physically threatening my bartender the police met her in the lobby escorted her to her room at which time they passed her onto her teen aged daughter and said she need to stay in here or they may remove you the mother came back down to the lobby with her daughter and started yelling at u again at which point we stalled while the bar supervisor called the police again the daughter even silently apologized to me my other auditor let her know that we have the authority to call the police to kick her out and that we strongly advise she just go back to bed she laughed and walked to her car to get something so we called the police the police walked around the premise and couldn t find her then went up to her room to check on the child she then stroll into the lobby oh you re going to kick me out how tragic while laughing we said yep she turn around and the police were right there her daughter started bawling and we felt so bad for the child but in reality no matter what we did she wa going to treat her child the same way regardless of what we did and we have to protect our staff and property while waiting on her daughter to bring the car back a police officer sat in the lobby with the mother and two younger child she wa berating her middle daughter her ex husband the staff of the hotel and the police officer himself and then when it came time to leave she scooped up her four year old said we love this hotel it been fantastic love you and almost walked kid first into the automatic door and now i m hour behind schedule because i had to send my other audit home due to emotional distress
i ve been working at a restaurant for a steady period of time now i wa lucky to be hired since i am not from this country and i had no experience in the food industry i just needed a job i wa warned from the beginning from worker that were leaving that the bos ha a tendency to build up resentment against worker for no legitimate reason and have it come to a head badly well i think that s what s happening now at my last shift there were three of u two on the floor one behind the bar me it wa quiet but then we blinked and every single table wa full we had just switched to a new cash register system that i personally found easier but the waiter on the floor were still not used to it and were therefore very slow with putting in drink order and food order not only wa i behind on drink order because of just how many table were ordering and how complicated some order were but the waiter on the floor took a very long time at the cash register while food order were beginning to come down i took some food order out myself but in general when someone work the bar our goal is to make sure they don t leave the bar too often and i wa already behind on drink order and glass polishing the bos came down several time throughout my shift and wa picking on me specifically first he made a point of showing that i wa neglecting to take down ticket because this wa a minor detail affected only me and i had a million other thing to do then he scolded me for keeping thing like napkin and dirty food on finished plate i wa sending up which wa never an issue before one of the waiter and i were scrambling to clean up after the other waiter that wa making more mistake than either of u but we were getting the most flack for it regardless after work wa done he called me up and accused me of not caring about the job of sitting around and doing nothing of making the shift harder for the other two he didn t give me a chance to even explain myself saying that since i ve been working this long and still can t be independent he s going to be taking away some privilege he did the same thing to the other waiter that wa working harder but not to the waiter that wa screwing u up the most i know this is the industry but i m very frustrated by the fact that he assumes the absolute worst of me and doesn t trust me enough to tell him what i think went wrong especially since i wa on the floor the entire time and witnessed everything one of my coworkers warned me that he heard the bos talking about firing me but at this point i m ready to quit since i m new to this country i really need the money but i guess now that i have some experience i d probably be better off working elsewhere

i work at what most would consider a higher end restaurant in manhattan the money i would be making would be great except the restaurant seems to be taking money from the server i won t give too much away but basically we have to tip out a pretty large percentage it s not really what i m worried about because even after this tip out the tip is still good i keep track of all of my tip in an app that calculates how much i make each week including tip out amp amp my hourly wage this week i made over in tip and over in hourly yet i only got paid i ve only been working here for a short period of time and i m ready to find a new job except it s incredibly hard in the city being a full time student it seems a though every week i m talking to the person on payroll explaining why my check isn t right everyone ha mentioned their check being skimped from this place but no one is doing anything about it who can i go to for this and how can i report this
i ve been in the industry for a better part of year not once have i ever complained to a manager sent food back or used that i m in the industry so i know line i ve met a few guest that were just absolute fuck for no reason and they used that line if you ever were in the industry you can t tell me you never had a bad shift am i alone in this
it s the beginning of what look to be a very slow shift for me today i ve only been here for just over an hour and i ve already had a pretty amusing interaction with a guest a guy come into the lobby he s got a piece of paper in hand and doesn t come up to the desk right away but sort of look a bit bewildered walk through our small lobby look back and forth down the hall leading off of it and then come over to the desk the first thing he say is where s the mall we are just around the corner from a large retail hub that includes a large indoor mall it s only about mile away and super easy to get to so i explain the direction from the hotel to him he is still looking down at the piece of paper he ha in hand and say he think he may be at the wrong hotel he hand me the paper and it s his confirmation e mail and it show that he is in the right place which i confirm for him oh shoot i must have booked the wrong place then she s gonna kill me he say he say he meant to book at the place that wa attached to the mall but he swears it wa here that he called and spoke to someone there are not in fact any hotel directly next to the mall and certainly none that are attached to it in any way i inform him of this and he put his hand on his forehead and reiterates exasperatingly she is gonna kill me he go and sits on one of the lobby couch and is on his phone for a few minute he come back to the desk with his phone and show me that the call he made wa to our phone number and when he asked if we had any kind of breakfast someone here told him that we do and it s served just across the mall a little light bulb come on in my head and i think i m starting to understand what happened i tell him that we do serve a breakfast here and that it is served right across the hall from the interior lobby door i asked perhaps the person he spoke to had said right across the hall and not right across the mall i m braced for frustration but the guy just bust out laughing oh god you re probably right ooooh man my wife s going to be pretty disappointed i guess when she said she d just be sitting around bored while i wa at work i promised her she could spend time shopping at the mall onsite i say well we may not have the mall here at the hotel but it s pretty lucky that you did still book a hotel that just happened to be pretty close to one doe it have a sephora store he asks i tell him it doe and he say alright i m saved i shall live through this day after all i m certain a couple minute in an uber isn t going to be too much hassle for her i get him all checked in and he wa on his way not going to lie it is extremely refreshing to get a guest that handle a misunderstanding well instead of blaming the hotel for their own mistake for once i hope his wife enjoys the mall

this happened last night it wa my first table of the night a man walk in with his two kid he look at the sign we have on the counter then walk forward i ask him if he would like a booth or table he say booth i seat them and then ask what they would like to drink we don t really do introduction where i work he say the special i knew what he wa talking about but that wa for food and i wa trying to take their drink order so i ask again what would they like to drink he say i want the pickup special and i say yes you can do that but it is a large topping for dine in not a large topping but before i can finish saying that he loudly say we re going somewhere else i can t stand your attitude you cant answer a simple question once he say that i m just incredibly confused and just stand there a he is getting up then he asks where our manager is i say he is upfront he get up walk up to the counter and proceeds to spew some lying bullshit to my manager about how i wa rude and had an attitude he leaf good fucking riddance then my manager come over i explain what happened he doesn t give a shit and then say you need to watch what you say because you can come off a rude this entire situation is hilarious i have never had a customer complain about me being rude before ever in fact i am the server who usually get the most compliment from customer also i m just thinking that it s hilarious that my manager say i m rude when he is literally one of the worst manager ever to his employee the customer love him because he only ever care about them he doesn t give a shit about his employee he never give u day off if we ask for them call people retarded stupid among other thing yell at the server if we forget to ask table if they want blue cheese or ranch for wing during buffet yell at u for not doing anything when it is slow a fuck and everything is done anything he can yell at u for he will i honestly wanted to go home after that but i didn t of course my bos continues to stare at me all night long probably thinking i still have an attitude or some shit this whole situation wa just hilarious also it brings up a very important question what is the karen name for male customer

so this happened a few day ago during one of my night shift and it started out a just a really inconvenient series of circumstance that resolved into me doing my job poorly i only had three check in when i came in two of them had given a time of arrival and the third ended up calling me like minute before midnight to let me know through a shoddy phone connection that kept cutting out that they wouldn t be in until after a m this wa great news because it meant i could just check them in run night audit at midnight and have hour to do whatever it is that i do well the night wa going much smoother than i d anticipated considering we had a full house and i d only seen one individual after midnight who had gone out for a smoke i finished night audit around and knew i had a bit until the bar crowd started coming back it wa a saturday night shit wa cash i did my first patrol of the night went out for a smoke and came back in to hunker down and chill out maybe bump some tune and read one of my book cool easy peasy night fast forward to around am at this point i had done all my patrol and i wa in the breakfast room finishing putting out all the pastry and juice and coffee and what not now we have a phone for when we re away from the desk so we don t miss call while we re doing shit though it doesn t work for in house call but to be fair it s am and i never get call at this time so i m not really paying attention to where the phone is anyway not to mention i had just taken a gnarly shit around a m that lasted an unfortunate minute thanks to my dreadful eating habit putting me behind schedule and making me anxious to catch up i had stopped back by the desk at ish to put the sign up on the counter saying i wa away so it s i finished all my breakfast shit and i m going back to the desk to grab the paper when i see a white van just sitting there in front of the double door gt that s odd i open the door to check and see what the van is already thinking it wa some late shipment of food a that happens from time to time just a i open the door the paperboy come running up to me from the square and hand me the paper cool timing there are people just sitting in this van staring at me little weird so i close the door and walk inside well this mom come frantically running inside please please will you let me in i ve been calling and calling and no one is picking up and the door are locked and my poor baby have had to sit here for an hour and a half at this point i should probably mention that we lock the door at midnight and there s a doorbell that you can ring for me to let you in evidently i didn t hear either the phone ringing or the doorbell from the breakfast room my first thought is oh shit i fucked up but also i remember that i wa at the desk at and did not see or hear anything so i knew she wa embellishing but still it s plausible she waited for half an hour which is absurd at this point i knew it wa the lady who called and said she d be here after two i had unfortunately already assumed she just wasn t going to show up because typically around i ve had people just not show up and not call because they new they were going to get charged anyway so i feel bad i get her id and everything and check her in and then i unlock just the right door since it s too early to unlock both and i go off to finish my duty because i m still behind at this point gt come out of the office after filling out the back board gt see door being tugged on gt sorry m am the left door is still locked i let her in after her probably standing there for another minute i go to turn the hot plate on and finish brewing hot water gt come back gt tugging on door gt m am the right door is unlocked repeat this twice and at this point i m just sitting at the desk apologizing to her for how shit i have made her morning she wa reasonably polite and rightfully a little frustrated up until this point all of a sudden she break and say don t you get grumpy with me i ve been waiting here for hour and i m tired my baby are cold and tired and my daughter peed herself because she couldn t get to a bathroom in time and i just want to get to bed but you just keep on ignoring me gt ow i feel like shit the whole time i wa trying to apologize to her all but supplicating myself because i felt like garbage for doing a bad job i just sat there staring at a wall for minute feeling like shit because i did a bad job and there wa nothing i could do about it well there wa one thing i could do i paid for her stay which alleviated the pain of evildoing just enough but that is not where the story end i m afraid my bossbrother brother bos man who is my brother and my bos he s my brotherboss came in to relieve me of my shift at am he s never on time because i m his brother and he s salary and he might a well be a fucking teenager and after filling him in i went home to lament the rest of my family with tale of the shit lord night audit worker fast forward to later according to my brother the lady came up to him to complain about me calling me a little guy and talking somewhat jovially about the misunderstanding just a i expected my bossbrother offered to knock some dollar billz off the room for the inconvenience and then when he went to do that in the system later he saw that i had paid my workdollars for her leisuretimes here we go fast forward a day the next shift had told her that her room wa comped by the hotel so she knew her room wa free okay okay so my sister is in housekeeping well after the lady had checked out house keeping went to clean her room duhh my sister know the girl who cleaned her room now deadass i am not exaggerating there w a s s h i t all over the bed the sheet the wall the shower curtain the floor the bathroom the furniture there wa shit everywhere literally human shit her little turdass kid shit everywhere w h y w h o t h e f u c k k n o w s so now we re just waiting to see what our manager charge the bitch for literally shitting on our room anyway i probably left out some detail but i knew it wa gonna be long and i just needed to get to the part about the shit all over the wall i hope you guy enjoy the rest of your day and please night audit don t lose track of your phone tl dr i did a shit job made a lady wait a while to get into the hotel at like am felt bad paid for her room and then she literally shit and smeared shit everywhere on her room without knowing i had paid for it to make up for the bad service
i work at a big brand hotel and our reward program let u purchase master gift card with point they get given to you anonymously and i got one with point and purchased someone anger management course for like he wrote a horrible review for our hotel saying that it wa absolutely the worst experience that he ever had with no other context well in the review he rated everything a low a a and then said he had problem with the tv heater loud noise his check in reception wa horrible check out reception wa horrible and his bill resolution wa horrible now i gotta make one thing clear with this guy the forum he filled out asks if you reported these problem and he said he did and that he wa ignored now think about that for a second a a business if someone ha that many problem why or how would he ever be ignored that is like of his room not working properly well the answer is he didn t report a damn thing i in fact know he didn t because it ha been people who worked with him at all myself and my manager my manager didn t give him bad service i know her very well and that woman is great with people and ha been doing this a long time she wa the one who checked him in and i checked him out now when i checked him out the guy seemed pissed off i asked him how everything wa and he replied with a grumbly it wa fine i m here to check out so i go through looking for him under our due out section and don t see him turn out he want to leave a day early i normally am not allowed to let people leave early however it wa in the morning and the guy seemed upset so i let it slide to hopefully make his day better our hotel charge at check in which is told to the person a they check in and i refund him the difference of his last night i inform him it wa a thursday and refund like that sometimes take a while to process that close to the weekend so he may likely see his money back the following week we don t control the money his bank doe i just told him that a a courtesy he nodded thanked me and told me to have a good morning and walked away all while still kinda pissy but not once did this man mention a problem with our hotel for all i know he could have been fighting with his wife he didn t seem to be directing it at me though so i didn t think much of it people sometimes just don t do well in the morning it s not like it wa extremely out of the ordinary and this spanned over one night our manager checked him in i checked him out and we had our night auditor confirm not a damn peep from them between pm and am the only thing that may have even been considered bad service is that i wa away from the desk for a moment i wa using the restroom lol and when our clerk step away we take a phone with u and put a sign up with a number to call and a house phone hang on the wall behind it it s a pretty good system it help people see that even if we re not immediately there we are literally one call away well i come back after using the restroom to see him standing there waiting guy read the sign and everything but didn t call the phone i wa gone at most minute maybe five but early in the day is the best time to take care of that stuff since most people check out between and my point in all of this the guy seemed somewhat annoyed but i wasn t about to pry him for answer i asked if his stay wa okay and he told me it wa fine in a fairly dismissive manner usually that s a cue to just shut up and give them a receipt and wish them well but his review is genuinely terrible nothing i have seen in three year of working here seemed to me a scheme to try and get some free point or worse yet a comped stay this man lied about reporting his problem likely lied about the problem a we checked his room after the review came in and the tv and heater worked perfectly fine didn t even give u an opportunity to try and make thing better and expected u to read his mind if you don t ask you will not receive help hotel will happily fix anything for you but we don t know unless you tell u in fact you really should tell u you might make it worse for someone else inadvertently if his tv really wasn t working why in the hell would he not call someone or come to the desk if his bill wa not properly resolved why have we not heard from him that is his money he so openly said we fucked up apparently his check in and check out service wa horrible i can t really speak for myself i know i m not god s gift to desk clerk but i know damn well his check in went just fine our manager would have mentioned it if anything wa wrong that s how hotel work if something go wrong it get passed on so you don t get blindsided i even asked her about it after we saw the review and she didn t think anything wa wrong at all the whole night at least in regard to him so for once i decided to take some revenge i took his email and name and signed him up for anger management course he wa clearly too inept emotionally to express his dissatisfaction with u through big boy word so i figured get him enrolled i really wish i could see the phone call he got from them but ala that will never happen but i can rest easy knowing i just spent imaginary dollar on absolutely nothing but a goofy as smile on my face hopefully he is doing well and the therapy ha done him some good never received a call about his bill so i guess whatever problem he had with it is just going to be left unchanged tl dr guest at our hotel lied about a bunch of problem so i bought them anger management course
so what should have been a minute check in wa a minute nightmare so the guest come in they aren t the person who is supposed to be checking in but they are on the accompany list so i let it go just a long a they have their own credit card they re married so yes technically lol i try and run the card but the company field is empty this doesn t allow me to run the card which requires a gtd so after i get the card on file then run the card to charge it i am informed that the company section is blank i input the information then try again this time the card reader freak out and refuse to allow me to run the card i have to reset the damn thing i do it minute have passed then someone is messing with the file which doesn t allow me to alter any info another minute pass finally i am able to the same issue happens with me just wanting to run the card i didn t notice the company field wa still blank the guy is stressed and i understand and am also stressed he decides to cancel but i convince him that we try once more and if it doesn t work then we part way the same issue with someone else accessing the reservation persists but i remember to input the company info first then do thing a i have always done it the god forsaken system is able to run the card and charge it man signed the paper and he wa finally in fuck sake also the wife wa asleep so she wasn t accessing the file have no idea what the shit happened there but we got through it so at this point i don t give a damn about it
i find this really hard to do any tip
this is only my second post here so please bear with me and excuse my grammar and format backstory i work at a fairly popular seafood restaurant in a coastal town my mother passed away when i wa younger and it affected how i look at the world greatly now onto the story i wa working new year s eve at the restaurant and it wa a pre fixed menu of four course i got to my table and didn t even get to say my usual server spiel before this lovely lady said to me oh you just be kylie ya know i requested you because you have such a lovely face so this table had already started out nicely well she went on to tell me that she and her husband were going out tonight to cheer her up a her mother had recently passed at this point i dropped my service face and got real with her i told her that grief is like a handbag that s the size of a suitcase at first but after time and healing it becomes like a small wallet i told her i know what it feel like and i m so sorry at this point i brought out my animal picture i have dog and cat to try and cheer her up she liked them so much she had me show her a new animal picture each time i brought a course or stopped to check on them by the end of the meal she liked me so much she got down the day i usually work so she could request me again overall a very wholesome and wonderful table now fast forward to yesterday i wa in the service area putting in an order and one of the hostess came to let me know this very insistent lady wanted to see me i walk out and lo and behold the woman from nye wa here she told me that she wanted to stop by to give me a gift bag full of cat toy for my new kitten it really warmed my heart to know i wa able to make a difference in this woman s life to the point where she bought cat toy thinking of me she wasn t even dining in the restaurant that day i wanted to share it all with you a a lot of post are about nasty or troublesome customer i hope you all enjoy

good early morning everyone i m a night auditor at a hotel somewhere in nebraska i ve developed a reputation amongst the day walker for always being the one on shift when the crazy shit happens so i thought i d share one of my most in famous story from this past summer our property ha a decent sized conference center attached on the bottom floor of one of our wing this particular night it wa rented out for a wedding i think most of you are probably already groaning internally trust me it get better i don t remember the specific number but when our bar manager left around midnight she said they had gone through whole keg of beer plus several other case and bottle needle to say they were hammered we typically keep our pool open a an extra novelty draw to convince people to stay with u the pool is isolated from the rest of the building so a lot of noise in there isn t going to wake anyone up a such our policy for drunk people in the pool is typically they re fine a long a they aren t too drunk to stay afloat and don t break anything we d rather have them making noise in there than disturbing others by being rambunctious in the hall i think you might see where this is going so the bar for the wedding party shuts down at midnight the bar staff clean up lock up and leaf this leaf poor me a the only employee on site for the remainder of the night several member of our wedding party decide they re not done and migrate to the pool probably about a dozen people or so maybe two dozen at the most they sneak in some outside case of beer to keep the party going i don t really notice it until it s too late being busy with other desk duty they also erm don t have swim suit no one is skinnydipping thank the god but everyone is in their underwear by the time i catch them since it s just me and i wa fairly new at audit i figure i ll let it slide yes i know big mistake and just casually mention to them that they need to have the alcohol thrown away by am last call in my town i think they ll be out of there by at the latest i wa wrong i check on them still drinking can and case of beer everywhere i catch the attention of one of the more sober of the guest and have him remind his friend that the alcohol need to be gone right now i watch him begin to pick up and throw away what s left confident that it would be resolved or more of the party show up carrying another open case i stop them and tell them it s after cut off and they can t be drinking that i tell them to throw it away they do i walk in to check the pool chemical to find that the case ha been dug out of the trash and give them all a final warning that if i catch them drinking in the pool again they ll be kicked out of the pool and made to go to their room i stare down a couple that wa close to if not all the way having sex in the middle of the pool until they separate gross several of them leave i presume that they went to bed i wa wrong the pool start to quiet down for a while i think it will soon be over i walk in and warn the guest that the breakfast bar worker will be in in about a half hour and if they don t want a couple middle aged woman seeing them in their underwear they should probably get up to bed this doe nothing breakfast bar worker arrive i am thankful to finally have backup and other employee to witness the shenanigan going on in the pool while discussing the situation with them i glance over and see that they have the back door of the pool technically the emergency door propped open and are letting people in and out through there there are again alcohol can everywhere nope this is not happening i m officially done with their shit i walk in drawn up to my ft broad shouldered broad chested height of bearded fury like a viking of yore and yell at them to get their attention i m going to have to have you all get out of the pool and go back to your room right now i told you to stop drinking several time you re letting people in and out through the fire door which is a security risk i can t verify which of you are guest and which are not everyone out some of them grumble that the pool is supposed to be others try to argue to stay because they weren t drinking i tell them too bad you broke the rule get out now or i m calling the cop i stand outside the pool room watching them drag as out of the pool collecting their stuff and getting dressed before stumbling to their room the last guest leaf the pool area i walk in to inspect the condition of the area they have left garbage and discarded clothing all over the poolside area while i begin to clean up i notice a smell is that seriously cigarette smoke in the pool room yup not only that they d been using one of the table a an ash tray i take a few picture of the condition they left the pool in with my phone log the situation in our computer system and ask one of the breakfast bar worker to step in to verify that it doe in fact smell like they smoked in the pool room it doe i collect their abandoned belonging in a large trash bag and put it in the back office to hopefully catch some name so that management will know whom to charge the smoking fee s to i finally sit down for a moment having a very mild asthma attack right a the morning worker arrives at within a week management decided that we can close the pool when there is an event in the conference center and only one auditor on shift

i m a bartender i work in a hotel bar most night it s just myself working and i generally enjoy the work i ve definitely had a few guest have a few too many and hit on me but non have ever invited me up to their room for any reason last night a guy wa by himself and he ordered a few of my specialty cocktail he closed out once and decided to have one more charged to his room so he filled out the receipt and left me bill one with if you re bored later and feel like hanging out with an old guy room number i wa definitely a little shocked but just brushed it off and set it aside turn out later in the night i accidentally used that bill for someone else s change and said something about it when my manager wa walking through the area my manager wa definitely concerned and said he wa going to have a conversation with the guy and security about it i know it s not right to take that kind of shit from customer but i honestly feel bad for the guy who left it he didn t pester me wa the easiest customer i had that night and just took a chance
so i get to work at midnight and at around i get a call from one of our room the gentleman on the line say that his wife want to check out i tell him that since they ve now effectively used the room i can t refund their room charge only the deposit policy is that if you re in the room longer than a couple of minute you ain t get your money back save time with all the people that come to to fuck then try to get out of paying and hour later anyways guy say he ll tell his wife and hang up about minute later they come down to the front desk say they want to check out and that they want their money back i tell the lady that s not possible she doe not take that well i expected that but what i didn t expect is what came next her and her husband start fighting more her than the husband really he s relatively calm he say let just stay here because i don t want to lose a hundred buck she keep going off about how she doesn t like it hear it not a fancy place but it clean i haven t heard any noise complaint etc i m not sure what her problem with the property is exactly but she s fuckin adamant that she doe not like it here to the point where she s both in tear and yelling that meanwhile i put the refund through on our debit machine and he just stand there staring at it instead of y know putting in his card the thing time out while he wait and finally turn back to his wife trying to convince her to stay a cab pull up for them and she start demanding buck from the husband if he stay because she paid for the room but want to leave claiming she get him deal all the time i m just flabbergasted at this point she leaf the front desk lobby and he go after her to talk more i hear her say some heinous shit followed up by y know i love you right after a bunch of screaming and cry from inside the cab this poor cabbie the husband come back in and say he ll take the deposit refund of course now would be the time for the thing to start randomly spouting communication error requiring a lengthy reboot which prompt the wife to come back into the lobby to see why it taking so long i explain she angrily reply with what are you gay da fuck to which i respond with a diplomatic ma am that s highly inappropriate and then get told to fuck off the refund finally go through and they leave and i could not add them to the blacklist fast enough the funny thing is right a he wa leaving the husband said that he though she wa so mad because the nearby bar carded her and wouldn t let an obviously late s early s woman drink

the other day i had a gentleman come in with whom i assume is his mother i ask them if they want a table or booth they say table so i start to take them to our smallest available table a top they stop and sit down at an top saying we always sit here fine whatever they order and the mom get a turkey melt and the son get the entree buffalo chicken mac and cheese and two double bacon cheese burger one with normal fry and the other with loaded cheese fry a they re sitting at this huge table eating their food we start getting busy and a large table walk in and it s my turn in rotation only i can t take them a i don t have a table large enough to seat them since these two are at the top they finish their dinner and i ask if they want any dessert the gentleman if i can even call him that order our largest dessert that i can share with my boyfriend and we ll both be stuffed and he eats all of it so finally the time come where i bring their bill it wa or something like that he give me and say keep the change so i start getting alittle upset but i remain calm and hopeful a this man and his mom proceed to sit at the table for another hour plus just chit chatting i go over and refill their drink and make sure their alright hoping they ll leave cash when they get up sure enough when they get up to leave they leave no extra money so not only did they tip me cent they occupied a table meant for a party much larger than theirs for turntimes making me miss out on big bill who apparently all tipped or more i found this out in speaking to their server edit to add we also tip out at the end of the night so i essentially paid to serve them a their cent tip wa probably le than what the tip put increased via serving them
it wa my first night of serving and i wa doing fine up until a had a table who ordered wing and side of fry and a beer so the manager is freaking out cause the entire kitchen is held up turn out i somehow rang in the order twice and the cook wa pissed she yelled at me and said that s the third mistake i made tonight and i need to do better i understand it wa a hassle and it held the kitchen up and now they owe money but it wa an accident and it wa my first night and i kept apologizing i had no issue doing that to any other table my manager were pissed cause they owed which i offered to pay off and they declined and the cook wa infuriated i don t know if this is a common thing in restaurant considering this is my first serving job and if it s unprofessional to yell at the server like that i felt disrespected i could see if i been there for awhile but it wa my first night
i worked p p last night it wa just a weird day it started when some greek guest checked in they said they were here for their anniversary the husband immediately say asks what we re going to do for them i m standing there blindsided and a bit offended that it s my responsibility to stroke their ego whatever the bos wa standing right there she wrote a note and we re probably going to do a gift card and bottle of wine for them anyways they come back down about hour later asking for dinner recommendation i frown slightly because i never eat out and that s my least favorite question the wife immediately grab the manager card great next a construction group thats been staying at the hotel one of their guy broke his phone screen and i spent an hour playing technician trying to help him get data transferred to the new phone because i ve got a little bit of experience doing that the last thing that happened that sort of ticked me off a guest call down from his room angry about the wifi i immediately try to assist him getting his laptop set up to the internet so he can watch a movie and he doesn t let me get more than word in he swears up and down then say f this and hang up when i first started in hotel within week i d had my first call to the police over a guest threatening to use their handgun on another guest that drunk gunless guest wa easier to interact with than the people i dealt with last night it really irritates me how people kid mode turn on a soon a they walk into a hotel no logic no reasoning they just shut their brain off when they walk through those door can the guest look for their own dinner recommendation yeah they re they ve eaten at more restaurant in more country on this planet than i have they ve got smart phone but no they re lazy and entitled construction guy won t listen when i say your screen is broken and this isn t going to be an easy fix you ll need a technician and wifi guy won t calm down long enough to let me fix his problem anyways i get home and go to bed the whole night i m dreaming about those same guest and this time they re coming behind the counter it s time for a beer
at the restaurant i work at there are no door to the kitchen there are just a couple wide opening one of the opening is several foot from the host stand which is several foot from the door when we re really busy people completely fill up this area it is just irritating when you re carrying a heavy tray of food and people are standing right in front of the entry to the kitchen and are oblivious to employee carrying drink food and whatever the fuck else then they awkwardly take a couple step to the side realizing they re in everyone s way one time i wa carrying a small tray with empty glass and a family didn t see me or hear me say excuse me right behind one guy turned and walked right into me and knocked all the glass off the tray and of course right around a bunch of people i guess i m pissed that some people are just so blissfully unaware of their surroundings at all moment of time
been in this restaurant for a year and a half never written up only late a few time early in when i first found out i wa pregnant manager always randomly telling me how great i am not to brag i m just a high work ethic people person who s been in much more difficult position than hosting anyway yesterday i got written up had a guy come to get food to go i wa headed to the back to pump breastfeeding mom gotta do what you gotta do and my manager wa watching my desk i see the guy say i ll just grab his food before i go take it to him run back for some sauce he requested and head back to do my thing fa forward hour to my cut time manager asks why this check wasn t closed out and it wa the guy i panic because i had assumed the manager did it i even told him the worst part is that you were right here when it happened manager say i thought i saw him signing something anyway it s your job to make sure people pay so it s still a write up and i just can t mad at myself for messing up mad at the manager for writing me up when he messed up just a much and mad at the guest for leaving without paying ughapotamus
hey again doing my once a month sharing on reddit today a i ve mentioned i work at a full service resort i m still kinda new not new to hotel but definitely new to a special level of entitlement i ve never witnessed last night a top shiny tier guest approach my fom with an interesting complaint i almost couldn t believe what i wa hearing yeah so i m a demon member and i shouldn t have to wait in line for the free drink ohh sorry about that i can contact the bar manager if you like no i just wanted you to know it s ridiculous you should have a special line for demon member we serve free alcohol to all guest for hour every night extremely generous in my opinion perhaps too generous since the bartender usually end up working their ass off for shitty tip the demon member confronted the bar manager about the line he felt entitled to bypass the bar manager explained that it s actually illegal to have more than one line serving free alcohol my question to this shiny asshole if only i could ask why not just bypass the whole welfare booze line by paying for your drink at the regular bar it s wide open and literally right fucking next to the free line if you perceive yourself a better prove it shouldn t you be able to afford your own damn drink despite your demon status you re nothing but a cheap entitled fuck with a grandiose sense of self given to you by a fucking hotel chain pathetic sad really honestly these people keep my profession interesting but human are just disgusting sometimes
i m on mobile be warned short and sweet i wa working at a mid range mexican restaurant plate this particular shift wa a friday crazy until about pm then tapering off we had a bus lady who wa in her s and highly respected like abuela on steroid what she said wa a good a god s she wa some kind of doctor back in mexico but her husband wa a professional and she moved up here and bussed table since she couldn t be licensed here for medical practice at our restaurant your server report is printed out and credit card tip are handed to you from the till in cash only a manager could do this and the assistant manager wa out with the plague i wa very new my first serving job and only about three week in i knocked on the office door and see in sequence the bus lady opening the door with her vest off the manager all pound of him sitting at the desk with his shirt off with dozen of needle sticking out of his back she had acupunctured him in a restaurant in his office i didn t say a word and picked up my tip the next day
and think it s ok to have a minute or even minute meal then fuck you double fuck you for ordering coffee amp dessert after the door are locked take that generous tip and shove it up your as haven t served in year but still gtfo
update she backpeddled mostly because she didn t realize i had been turning in doctor note every day and that wa actually the issue she also of course said she said just let u know if you need modification to work and they are ordering smaller garbage can and lower rack for kid cup so no more climbing for thing turn out other smaller woman have been complaining too so not fired have a job shes still one of those manager we have a new manager she said if i need modification this is not the job for you we need people who can move fast she also said right now this doe not look good me cry with a new hire next to you this all happened because i had just been sat a very snotty family who wa disgusted with their high chair and i could not move it and wanted a regular chair and could not grasp that their wa one right next to them they could have so i needed help in come the bitch manager who ha spent all of now week with the company me year the manager also found time to go we don t know where the hell you went when i wa dropping off doctor letter every day oh ok see you next tuesday
warning one aspect of this tale is disturbing very disturbing please be aware i am not sure what happened to this horrible excuse of a person disclaimer i do not work housekeeping i am not fully aware of how their policy work i do know at my hotel property that we have to go into the room after three day i wa not aware we have not been in the room for over day i did not know any of this wa going on i mainly work shift morning shift are rate for me the housekeeper tended to the room have all gotten write ups or have been fired from their job after this incident disclaimer my gm doe what she wish she ha been the gm of the property since she wa she is in her s now whatever she want go i do a she say not blindly but with this instance i let her handle it for it wa a disturbing situation any question you may have i probably do not know almost all question have not been answered to this day the man from seemed like a chill dude he wasn t all up there but he wa nice and respected u he didn t ask for anything for the two whole week he wa here he wa from out of state he would uber all the time came in not wearing shoe a lot i didn t question it he wasn t hurting anybody well he kept extending his stay with the same person over and over again that person wasn t authorizing the credit card which is something we have to do at my property it ensures we will get payment and there is money on the card nobody did that so after two week i come into work and my co worker told me his card declined he owed u about buck so i called his room and told him i need payment he hung up on me i informed my gm and manager they told me to deactivate his room key which will make him have to come to the front desk and talk u so i did just that he came down for breakfast he tried to go back up to his room key card did not work he came to the desk my gm handled it from there since it wa such a large amount of money owed to u she informed him that he is not allowed back into the room until we get payment for the entire stay two whole week of room payment again gm said that not me he sat back down in the lobby he somehow got the full payment of the room he paid u the amount owed asked to extend we extended it for one more night authorized the amount for one night worth all good to go he left for the day the head housekeeper came to me and told me the room wa a wreck i asked what she meant by a wreck she said his do not disturb sign ha been on the door for two week the housekeeper who tended to the rd floor either didn t tell her he had the sign on or said they gave him service so they lied because they didn t want to deal with it is our policy that we have to go into the room after three day you do not have to have service but we just want to make sure the room isn t destroyed i informed my gm of this she sighed and called the man in and informed him of the policy and that it ha been well over three day and after the incident with payment this morning she is going into the room he told her she couldn t go into the room she said alright hung up and called our regional manager on this issue he said to go into the room and make sure no property ha been ruined my maintenance man my head housekeeper and my gm all went into the room what they found ha given me a lot of unanswered question the clean up of this room cost more then the man cop throw down in the room wa massive bundle of rope rope you d buy at home depot if you wanted to make tire swing in your yard a well a a box of electrical tape clothes everywhere drug needle everywhere we had to watch where we stepped there were shirt covered in blood towel covered in pee and feces large amount of ham no bread just ham the mini fridge wa full of ham nothing to go with it just ham in the bathroom the tub wa full of hotel sheet on the bathroom counter laid the biggest butt plug i have ever seen they left the room and my gm called the man from that room and told him he ha exactly one hour to get back to the hotel get his belonging and leave and that she will be charging him more for everything that had happened to that room she also said if he is not back in an hour the police will be here waiting for him to escort him to the room and have him take his thing since drug needle were found we were not sure if he would go crazy from this or not so she wanted the police here just in case an hour had passed he had not come she gave him an extra minute he did end up calling and telling her he is on his way she told him she is calling the police on him to have him escorted to his room to get his belonging and out of the building he said alright and hung up he never came at this point my gm considered him trespassing and the destruction of property lead to the police being called and her allowing them to fully search the room it just got even more disturbing upon them searching the room they had discovered tube wrapped in hotel sheet the tube were used to insert into yourself and flush anything out of your system a well a bag upon bag of pee you apparently rubbed yourself with for sexual reason there were dildo being found wrapped in shirt they were either covered in blood feces or both they found more robe they found drug and needle a well a child clothing belonging to a young girl there wa never a girl with him that we were aware of we never saw a girl with him we only saw him the police ended up running his name in the system after finding the clothing and turn out he had multiple warrant for his arrest in florida they didn t say what he wa just wanted in florida we gave description of him to the police they asked for any information regarding him i had an idea of what he wa wanted for at that point based off how they were acting they parked their card across the street waiting for him to return he never did we hired a cleaning crew to clean the room there wa no way housekeeping wa going in there the cleaning people had to throw away everything in the room they did fill a small box of his belonging that wasn t covered in feces or blood all clothing in the room had to be thrown out our policy is we have to keep guest found belonging for day regional manager said throw it out we aren t having a bio hazard in the hotel for day keep what isn t a bio hazard for him the small box of his belonging sat in my gm office for a month dude had his friend come up here and pick it up for him that wa the end of it there is no way end this tale
our hotel allows member to stay for free on point top tier member most of them are entitled to free upgrade but we do have to charge a fee for an upgrade but for this one man i let it slide and later ended up regretting it now so keep in mind i never upgrade ppl for free until i had a gentleman call for a possible upgrade over the phone code entitled man em entitled man m me em this is first last name i m staying on point so i m wondering about a possible upgrade a a top level member name that rhyme with fire i don t say yes or no simply because since we were booked all weekend this wa on monday i have no suite clean and couldn t contact housekeeping m if i have a suite available i certainly will do em what do you mean i want the upgrade you should be able to i am a fire member m yes sir the thing is is that i will have to wait until housekeeping notifies me whichever room is clean because we ve been full all weekend em well okay so this mean depending on what is clean is what i get m correct em will do thanks i ll be there in about an hour m for sure see you then the only suite i had available for night for him wa a ada accessible romance suite it a gorgeous room with a jacuzzi fireplace a couch and a roll in shower w bar thats the only difference with lot of room now around he get here i greet him and notified him that i wa able to upgrade him however what i had wa the handicap suite he begin to fight with me about i wasn t prepared for him and his stupid as status i briefly explain it the only suite i had if he didn t want it i could move him to a queen room or stay with a king originally he refused and said thats not an upgrade i saw him browse online looking for a suite and duhh no suite on there either jackass if there wa i put them ooo i became annoyed because then he tell me if he can go look at it i gave him one of his key i immediately call my bos and told him what happened including to decide to upgrade this guy for free and wa ungrateful for it also explained to him that i notified the guest it is ada accessible he told me not to worry and wa laughing because what else doe he fucking want if thats all you have that is that you have i saw the em coming up pissed so i told my bos i ll call back later em come in and said there s got to be another suite available m no sir thats all i have em wheres your manager this is unacceptable i am a fire ali member m there is no manager on duty em call your f bos then i call my bos again and said he want to speak to you this asshole take my phone outside and began to argue about how we didn t prepare for his arrival my bos briefly told him we were understaffed that day booked all weekend also even told him that we usually charge fee for an upgrade if he doesn t want it then he can stay the room he booked himself almost the same shit i told him earlier but for some reason he decided to fight after he returned he half assed apologized to me it must ve hurt him to admit he wa in the wrong day later he then get rewarded with k point for upcoming stay which doesn t make sense because i thought my bos had my back so why reward this guy with k point especially since this wa no one s problem but his but whatever mostly mad at myself for even upgrading this guy in the first place

i had a table of about teenager they were all pretty nice except for this one guy that came later than everyone else i tried my best to get his food at the same time a everyone else so he s not left out when it come out and i make it happen then when i wa passing out the food i thought he ordered a side of fry but he didn t the guy at the other end of the table did i gave him his entr e and said you had the side of fry right and set it down in front of him and he looked at them and didn t say anything and i didn t think much of it the other guy said he wa missing a side of fry and i thought i just forgot to ring it in and put it in right away i then later realized when i wa getting the check that i did ring in the fry i just gave it to the wrong person but he didn t say anything so i put the side of fry on his bill he didn t say anything and didn t tip do you think i handled it incorrectly i know i set it down in front of him but i asked him you had the side of fry right and he didn t say a word and ate them i kind of feel bad about it afterwards because he s just a teenager would you have done something different
so i work at the front desk of a museum not a hospitality facility and thankfully people tend to be more agreeable here than most of your story this just happened a few minute ago and i need to share it with people who can commiserate for context our museum doe not get much government funding and relies on our income and donation for more of our cost than a normal museum might a such our admission price are higher than other place the increase brought adult entry to cad and senior entry to cad not cheap but it s going to a decent cause player me me vd veteran dude ow other woman so this group of senior come up and asks to get in ok cool no problem vd asks if veteran get a discount i said yes if you have your department of nation defense dnd id with you i can get you in for free vd say he left it at home i apologize because i do like letting people in for free but his wife say she ha the cfone card for member and their spouse for access to different veteran program and discount and i inform her after she cut me off twice that unfortunately we don t accept those it ha to be the dnd picture id this is my boss policy and inasmuch a i get final say a the head desk person here i don t push point like this one because i have other battle with him to fight i ring the four people up and it s well vd is like do we really want to go i don t want to spend and the ow reminds him it for people so per he grumble but say fine after ow pay he say oh you should have split it in two like im a damn mind reader i apologize again and he say he ha cash to pay the woman who paid and i tell him i can make change if he need it turn out he doesn t i give them their wristband good to go he wanders off and i m just chatting with the woman and giving her the receipt and she mention he ll probably spend more time than they have now but she s glad they got in now this is a case where i can flex a little bit and spread some good will i have the authority to give out the pass that never expire for complaining guest or for people who deserve them for one reason or another i say hold up a minute and grab her complimentary pass one for each person minus vd and explain this way you can come back when you have the chance and spend more time here i m giving you three because your friend get in for free anyways she s happy everything is good and i m feeling good she go over and explains the pass to her husband then vd and his wife and i stop paying attention and get back to juicy reddit story suddenly i see him looming over the side of my desk and i ask what i can do he hold up one of the pass i had given ow and asks for a fourth i explain that he get in free with his id so with everything taken into account the four can come back for free another day vd well what if i forget my id at home again i don t get a lot of entitlement here most people get this is technically a charity and we don t have gob of money to give away but this just struck me a so entitled and lazy how is it my problem it a card put it in your wallet and forget about it or use your brain ad grab it if you head to the museum those card are a good a cash here i just gave away up to because i wa feeling kind and you want another because of your own laziness unfortunately my boss attitude is there should never look like there is a problem at the front desk problem get moved away from the desk and away from guest coming in or we try not to create problem i know in this circumstance my bos would tell me to give it to him because hopefully he will come back and buy food or souvenir but man did i feel bad giving it to him most of my guest today have been awesome and i always hear great story about great grandpa so and so but he really soured the end of my day

i m about to check in a guest who complained to our corporate hq that he is always asked for id when he check in despite being a regular guest here now that is true he is a regular guest here but he is so not memorable that we do ask for id he is very plain and what is remembered about him is that he is very dour doesn t want to wait for our spiel about the amenity and overall impolite i think i saw him one morning after checking him in the night before and said good morning it wa unremarkable to say the least it s like he doesn t want to be bothered addressed or even acknowledge so imagine our surprise when he complained about being acknowledge when he come in he practically whisper mumble his name and if you ask him to repeat it he say it extra loud he s just ha an unnecessary rudeness about him it s literally for no reason so now i m waiting for him to come in we have comped him a suite for his stay and have a gift bag waiting for him a gift bag that he will probably snatch out of my hand and walk away without saying even thanks can t wait hellified eye roll update guest checked in hour ago spat out his name a he walked in and went straight to our market i told him that we have been expecting you and that i have his key already made then i presented his gift bag to him he actually did say thank you a he received it then said good night my take away from this is that we all want to be recognized and acknowledge but if we put off vibe that say otherwise then the opposite will happen we ll see how it go in the morning if i m still here when he come down for breakfast thanks for reading and commenting
excuse me if this is jumbled i m typing this out while working the morning shift on the sunday after a sold out weekend so i ve been dealing with a lot of check out and making change for a lot of people who kindly want to leave tip for our housekeeper and the cook for our complimentary breakfast this story is from yesterday the saturday in the middle of a sold out weekend most of our guest this weekend were in town for a local event and we re well known for being lenient with our check in time i e if your room is ready we will let you check in early and so for event like this and for wedding we always have hoard of people wanting to check in early and we do our best to accommodate them however friday night we had out of room occupied and on saturday i had check out and arrival check out is at am i had a hoard of guest wanting to check in by am housekeeping come in at am you do the math the first two people who requested early check in were easily accommodated because like i said we had two vacant and clean room from the previous day i hadn t even assigned room or made key by then so i just did it a i went after that though i wa fully prepared to give out my little speech about check in we guarantee your room and a speedy check in by pm and allow early check in based upon room availability at the requested time of check in unfortunately i do not have any room ready at the moment but if you d like to have some coffee or help yourself to some breakfast and wait in the lobby for a few minute i ll be happy to let you know when one becomes available this usually work pretty well for me but my coworker who is the cook for breakfast and sometimes fill in at the desk jumped in almost every time and told the guest directly that i could go check on housekeeping and let them know someone wa here to check in to speed up the process ummm no i can t first of all i am not going to rush housekeeping they already truck right along at what is a far a i m concerned a lightning fast pace and rushing them will only annoy them and make them start to miss stuff which will then make it so i have to fix anything they miss when i inspect the room before i put a guest in it inevitably making the point moot anyway secondly you re absolutely insane if you come into a hotel and expect to be able to check in before of the guest from the night before have even checked out just totally bonkers to me a reasonable early check in is like pm when standard check in time is pm if you want to check in at friggin am you might a well just stay the night before because i probably can t help you but i wasn t even mad at any of the guest in this scenario because they were all perfectly respectful and polite and i have no doubt that had i asked them to wait they would have been fine with it i wa annoyed with my co worker for saying that to the guest directly so that i had to then go report to housekeeping that someone wanted to check in a if they weren t already doing their job of course i told them to take the time they needed to do it right and if the guest had to wait then they d friggin wait i so wanted to say something but i didn t want to contradict her in front of guest especially since knowing her she would have argued it technically i do outrank her when i m running the desk but i hate to pull the rank card and pretty much just told guest even after i checked with housekeeping that it would be a few minute and i d let them know when they could check in just pushed my button lol
most of our regular at our lower budgeted pet friendly establishment are great and understanding except this one entitled douche he usually come in on a monday around am expecting to check into one of our easier access handicapped room for his wife i ve never personally seen her and will throw a complete whiny entitled fit if say we sold the room the previous night because it s the busy season which often happens without fail it s the same fit each time with plenty of f s for emphasis blah blah nothing changed from the last time sir check out time is check in time is pm not am if the room free of course once he s tucked in he stay for day and continues to display his characteristic douchiness his truck is so large he ha trouble parking it and routinely park sideways taking up space and god forbid someone actually need the space because i don t know they re actually disabled he can t be bothered with that of course another volley of f s i guess my question is how doe his wife get in out of his enormous truck if she s incapable of walking a few extra step to one of our regular room
i ve been at this restaurant on and off since i ve seen menu change the actual menu change from one page to back to i know thing about the greet thing about the kid menu and etc that people who have been there almost a long a me don t remember the hiring process for being a server ha really changed everything s on an ipad now and the restaurant now ha handheld po device there are still actual po but the company doesn t want u using them yes it negatively affect tip in these change they got rid of expo and bussers yes you probably know which chain i m talking about by now so i m a re hire and i wa supposed to certify a a server by combining week of training into day the problem is it ha been so randomly busy on the day i ve been training that i haven t been able to practice the handset which is almost like the po but when people fire their order at you it not a fast to navigate one modifier sure give me your order and then go back and decide to change your side and ask for more sauce each now i m thrown off so today management decided i wa wasting my time and made me run food which of course no one knew i wa doing so i didn t get tipped out for it i expo s and ran almost everyone s food and then because the shelf is so high i couldn t reach thing that the cook wouldn t push forward i m another short girl snarked and me said you can reach it you just want attention later i watched her get food by climbing on the counter and reaching for it oh ok just a rant but i ve never been in a restaurant where everyone walk around like snob and the management is so scattered and maybe i m thinking in the back of my mind a bit is this a bad idea
i have a good friend who i learned is being abused by her girlfriend i and another friend are going to where she life this weekend to get her packed and moved out today i asked where she wa going to move to and she had no idea and suggested maybe we put off moving her which is not going to happen she s not being physically abused but her girlfriend is threatening suicide threatening to hurt my friend s pet and burn her belonging she cannot stay there longer so i wa calling around extended stay hotel and i found one that wasn t too ridiculous the gentleman i wa talking to asked what wa bringing me to town for two week and i explained he immediately dropped the rate a low a he could he explained their security to me he explained that he s the general manager and then gave me his personal cell number just in case i m not sure exactly what that mean and i don t think he really did either but i am so grateful for him to have this complete stranger just instantly be on our side to have his support and his help it wa just amazing so for that general manager and for all of you out there like him thank you so much you ll never know how much your support mean when we re going through something hard thank you for making it easier
doing night audit tonight and some asshole on first shift switched a guest out of a room but didn t note it anywhere so a family showed up and the room they were assigned to had someone in it we are full so i have to figure out how to walk a guest luckily the night auditor at another brand hotel helped me out only thing is their rate wa a night these people had a rate of a night at our hotel so my gm is probably gonna be fucking pissed
okay so yesterday night i wa told that someone requested that the muffin be placed out at this is fine because i wrap thing up around that time skip to and this guy asks if it s ready this wa all second hand from a coworker so i assume this is the guy that wanted the muffin out early i nod and a minute later six people go into the breakfast area and eat muffin and shit that s clearly not muffin we re not supposed to let people eat early it put stress out on the breakfast lady and personally piss me off because i wa told it wa just muffin and not at all made aware that there would be six people which may entice other people into also eating effectively erasing all my hard work or at least a majority of it all for people tonight i wa asked to do the same no no i will not you and yours will eat with everyone else i thought they were checking out of the hotel but they are still staying for this morning still don t know their room but i don t care no one get preferential treatment go to mcdonalds down the road for your breakfast is this petty and entirely unnecessary most definitely but i don t like any unwelcome surprise especially when it just give u all a headache that shit s supposed to last for the next hour not minute before lunch even start
my property used to have a promotion where during the week guest would get a free candy bar and a voucher for our casino at the first of the year the new front desk manager decided to do away with the free candy bar promotion a few regular guest were slightly put out by this but they got over it but not the guy i had to deal with at the beginning of my na shift tonight oh no this guy wa gonna get a free candy bar by god and he wa gonna let me know about it so this big baby man or bbm for short spent the first minute of my shift ragging on the guy i wa relieving and then me for not being able to get a free candy bar bbm very drunk forgot to mention that i mean i come every three or four year and i usually bring five other room with me and i can t get a free candy bar swing shift fd person i m sorry sir but policy change all the time bbm when s your manager coming in i m gonna give him a piece of my mind swing shift fd person am i m sure he ll be happy to talk to you about it bbm i don t wanna bitch i mean the room are cheaper than the last time we stayed here but i really think i should be able to get my free candy bar now this whole time i ve just been counting the till and staying out of it but then he turn his attention over to me bbm so you re taking over now me mmm hmm bbm so if the drawer s off by say do i get a free candy bar then me no sir bbm i just don t think it s fair that you give people free candy bar and then take em away it s bullshit is what it is but oh well he then drunkenly stared at me for several uncomfortably long second before he shuffled off to i don t care where but a i wa typing this out he came back and i thought for sure that he wa going to start in about the candy bar again but he just thought i looked bored and wanted to say hi so i guess i ve made a friend huzzah tl dr a grown as man make a fuss over not being able to get a free candy bar and won t take no for an answer until he finally doe

so i m the night auditor at chain hotel in mid sized town we have a special event in house tonight taking up two room we put them right above one another because we figured they d make noise and were trying to isolate them a much a possible this failed horribly once i got in for my night shift i get a call within minute complaining about the noise from the lower of the two room this went pretty smoothly i called the room asked them to quiet down and they said they would then i didn t get another call for that room again the higher of the two wa not a understanding minute after the first call i get a call from one room complaining of noise from the higher of the two room i apologized and said i d ask them to quiet down i called the room but they didn t answer i figured i ll try again in minute and got back to my work not even minute later i get rapid call from other room complaining of noise from the same room i could no longer wait and be polite i called the room and they answered then immediately hung up they did this repeatedly i had our guard go up to the room and knock on their door they ignored him for minute till finally answering the door our guard asked them politely to keep it down and they said they would they then turned their music louder i went to see how bad it wa and i could here it from the elevator shaft a good story below the floor they were on at this point i wa repeatedly calling the room in rapid succession i d call they d answer and hang up i d call again repeat over time before they unplugged the phone in the room i told the guard to go up to the room knock on the door and don t stop till they answer once they do answer tell them that if they don t plug the phone in and answer it i will be calling the police they answered soon after and told me that whenever they picked the phone up the cord would come loose and hang up the phone yea right i told them that they need to quiet down and quiet down a lot if they don t quiet down and i get one more call from a guest complaining about their room i would be calling the police and filing a noise complaint they sighed and said they d turn off the music and settle down i didn t hear anything else about the noise for the rest of the night but the guard came to me a bit later and informed me that apparently the door to one of the room wa broken off one of it s hinge i get a call from the room a bit later asking for pillow and blanket i sent them for each individual room that complained about the noise tl dr guest decides to throw party in their room and make so much noise you can hear it on other floor of the hotel repeatedly dodge phone call and ignore knock on the door had to threaten police to get them to stop they broke a door to their room and asked for pillow and blanket afterword edit to answer a few question i keep seeing pop up it seems people think that the room were noisy from the first call on the lower room to the last call to the upper room i want to clarify after the lower room wa told to be quiet they did so and the building wa quiet till minute later the other room started acting up and were dealt with in minute or le i wrote this literally at the end of the shift it happened on i do not yet know what the overall end of the situation is i could and maybe should have been firmer with them but you guy are acting like this happened over hour it wa all over before am and lasted le than minute the first room wa quiet immediately and the second one started up a half hour later and wa loud for about to minute before i got them to stop the room complaining complained once i assured them i would get the situation handled and did so relatively quickly under the circumstance i gave each room a callback apologized and asked if i could make it up to them no one took me up on the offer call is a lot to make on a normal phone but all i had to do on the hotel phone wa dial number room number and each call wa very fast i could not go up to the room a im under strict rule to never leave the front desk unattended
i usually just leave work at work asshole be damned but this lady got under my skin real good this time we have a burger special on friday that umbridge occasionally come in for but i just transferred back to this location after being gone a few year so that make this our first encounter in some time pretty sure she doesn t recognize me which is ironic back in the day i wa the designated server to take care of her and her group because they would verbally abuse every other server i did a lot of anger management therapy at one point so i ve become pretty good at shutting my mouth when i want to explode it s really the only reason i can deal with her at all and why i would always get stuck with her she would request me because she said the other server were too rude you ll see that fucking irony in a second anyway they get sat and i m dreading the moment that she recognizes me and asks for me a their server it never come she doesn t seem to remember me at all and i m fucking elated we were slammed and had a new server working who wa halfway to weeded she s the one who ended up taking them call me selfish i don t care i wa not about to go out of my way to interact with her newbie be damned i had already picked up three of the new girl s table in addition to my own to help her out she wa on her own for this one in the past she s always been the epitome of a problem customer always trying to scheme for free food you charged me for an order of onion ring but i just wanted a side you do too have a smaller portion i ve gotten it before no bitch we don t and you haven t it s one size at one price deal yes i ate the burger but it wa dry and your kitchen cooked it too long i shouldn t have to pay for a burger i didn t like i asked you how your food came out and you said good now that you re done eating it wa bad you get the type super rude out of her mind she also like to bring her token black friend in with her from time to time and imply that random complaint she ha are based in race like the one time her friend s plate had numerically le onion ring than hers which she insisted wa intentionally done because her friend wa black demanded additional free onion ring her friend had le ring numerically because one of them wa huge whereas she had more ring that were smaller sized her friend hasn t ever implied such a thing herself and is generally nice to u but she also doesn t make any effort to stop her they all living in a nearby retirement community together so maybe she just doesn t want to deal with the social circle drama that would result who the fuck know anyway so it s the middle of a rush and i hear from newbie that umbridge is losing her mind about something shocker i m too busy to ask for detail the manager is handling it and i want nothing to do with them i keep doing my thing grateful she isn t my problem we re pretty busy and food is taking longer than usual so i ve got my own issue to deal with that is until i see her walking into the boh server line for context there wa an incident year ago where she wa so angry that her food wa taking too long that she walked into our server line and started moving around other people s food in the window looking for her burger she wa convinced that her food wa ready and we were refusing to run it to her i wa the only one working yesterday that knew about her doing this in the past and the only one who had noticed her at all so far i saw her coming towards u and told her a calmly a i could hey we can t have customer back here bitch lost her damn mind started screaming about how i wa a little smarta and how she wa going to have me fired my manager wa standing here for all of this and he took over while i bit my tongue and went back to traying up food i overhear her telling him how i ve been so nasty this entire time i m not even her server i have not spoken to her prior and how the only reason their food is taking so long is because we re all racist against her black friend dining with her dear god grant me patience she get a shitload of free onion ring while they re waiting you d think she would be in heaven and she spends that time harassing me while i m talking to table i have her in vicinity i would ask customer how their food wa and she would loudly talk at me and them about how this wa my last shift and how being a smarta is going to ruin my life my table all snickered at her about it so it wa a lot more embarrassing for her than me personally i wa just trying to remember my breathing exercise still i persisted didn t say a fucking word back thank god for therapy food finally come out and they make a big loud show about boxing it into to go box talking to nearby table about how the service ha gone to hell in a race car in recent year whatever the fuck that mean our manager drop their check with a discount and umbridge march her as up to our host on duty she hand her the bill for six people s food and informs her they won t be paying for any of it our manager ha been yelled at by her multiple time now been followed around the restaurant by her several time a he tried to check on the other thirty table we have he s watched her harass his entire staff and other customer in the restaurant to say he s over her shit would be an understatement he tell her that if she doesn t plan to pay the tab he would be calling the police she end up paying it but hang around a while after to loudly complain about her experience the entire restaurant is quietly laughing at her at this point and she eventually exit after telling u all we will be hearing from her lawyer about a racial discrimination suit for what it s worth she s white everyone working this morning wa white i m hoping this mean she never come back but she always fucking doe i m sure i ll

me any time soon downside i stay through alone a lot of friday afternoon so a reunion may be inevitable i m planning to print a copy of the serenity prayer to keep in my server book sorry it wa so long i just really needed to cut that poison out of my brain tldr boomer make big boom customer laugh at her potential local paper headline impending white woman sue white staff for racial

recently i had a group stay with u a high school sporting event with about room for the rooming list they sent u their own template so we could add name to the room the thing with name is typically you can tell what a person first and last name is by looking at it for example tim mcdonkeyfellatio in our system it would read a mcdonkeyfellatio tim on this rooming list they gave i swear to god every single person had a last name that wa also a first name like joseph craig or steven jonathon since every single one wa like this i had no frame of reference so i just guessed anyway i pre checked the group in and wasn t here when they arrived there weren t any issue to speak of so either i guessed right or they didn t care that i had everyone s name backwards
tl dr guest brought and escort and the escort didn t have valid id escort suggest they go back to her place to get her id but the guest refused trying to force the guest to either go get the escort s id or go somewhere else we informed the guest he would be charged an extra night in a different room if he really wanted u to let the escort in without id the guest paid we checked them in they said they would never stay with u again it ha been a year and four month and they still haven t returned so a per my previous post i m a night auditor which is perhaps the most soulless position in the hospitality industry not only are we destined to not see the light of day rather spend our life dwelling in shadow forever running from light but we are also destined to see some guest in their le than stellar moment usually guest are aware of them being in such a moment and will quite hastily comply with the night auditor s preposterous demand such a sir please keep it down people are sleeping in this hotel and even i m sorry sir but you cannot smoke in the lobby please go outside a well a many others humanly impossible request ala some guest really do enjoy dragging their foot fighting out a battle they cannot win even when you explain it to them that it is over and you have the high ground there wa once one such guest and a per my previous story it didn t work out too well now luckly this time the night auditor had his colleague with him there were no shouting match and the night auditor didn t have to threaten placing a call to the local constabulary about a drunk and disorderly guest but boy oh boy wa he drunk and disorderly see i don t know what it is about business trip but apparently it is good practice to take your business partner out to peruse some more exotic meat the kind that walk and talk and if you pay their asking rate and treat them nice will even confort you from the dire feeling of loneliness you re experiencing from being away from the missus you see where i m going with this right the guest brought an escort a is our procedure we quite cheerfully greeted the guest despite him having a very pungent smell and putting up putrid cloud of what smelled like two day old roadkill marinated in cheap whiskey then we turned to his escort and asked to see her id by this point dear reader you must ve figured out that she didn t have her id who know maybe she forgot it at her one actual pair of pant back home because well skirt don t have pocket and even if they did it would probably just slow her down and this is where everything started to go wrong see mr lonely businessman wa not having any of it and right off the bat stated i paid for the room so i can take up whoever i want and you can t do a thing about it being an experienced creature of the night and a shrewd hotelier our hero or perhaps villain kindly informed the lonely businessman that thing did not work like such and a per hotel rule and for security reason she had to provide valid id we even went a far a to try and nudge him in the right direction by telling a very peculiar story about an italian man who had his passport stolen by an escort who wa now threatening to tell his better half about his unsavory adventure this sadly didn t work then again you can t quite reason with some drunk people especially horny drunk people ala his companion and soon to be entertainer did try to de escalate the situation by suggesting that they could take a cab back to her place so she could get her id and they d be back in a jiffy but she wa also met with negative response by this point mr businessman is slowly but surely turning the tide of this battle not with his intellectual brilliance but rather the overwhelming power of his rhetoric in other word his foul breath seeing a thing are not going to go anywhere and in order to prevent the situation from getting even worse our beloved hotelier hatched a cunning plan which would surely give them the upper hand from a tactical standpoint and informed the guest that if he did want to go up to a room with his escort without her presenting id he would be charged for an extra night and he would have to pick a different room so a to not risk getting his belonging stolen bear with me most people even drunk horny people will usually come to their sens somewhat when money is involved in this case since the hotel wa about full a night would be about time what the hotel would normally charge a guest for bringing an escort surely after hearing this our shrewd conquistador wouldn t mind getting a cab with his female company to go get her id however in a totally unexpected move worthy of being immortalized in the anals of the front desk s logbook the guest grumbled loudly pulled out his credit card and said charge it seeing a their plan backfired on them the night auditor unable to manuever themselves out of their own trap did just that charged the card had the escort fill out her check in form and gave them a room far away from the other room surely this is the end right well no not sufficiently happy with this tactical victory mr lonely businessman started to gloat about it and even taunt the night auditor i ve been staying here every two month for the last year you guy are toast followed by a seriously did you seriously need to charge me for another room wa it really necessary not cool man and a for the coup de gr ce i am never coming to this hotel again and your manager won t be happy about it gasping for air our hero hurriedly gave the foul smelling creature and his unlucky escort the key to their love nest hidden away at the end of a hallway on an empty floor after their quick departure he set about chronicling the event in the logbook and asked his aide to make a note on the guest s file guest is extremely rude however two discovery were made the first being that the guest used a corporate card to pay for the room and a such would surely be asking for a invoice the second the guest already had a note saying he wa quite rude on his file detailing his last stay where he threatened to never come back again not one to be content with being bested in a trial by combat our hero set about drafting the invoice and making sure that in some unremarkable place within this invoice it stated hotel stay for m escort the guest would not see it perhaps even his company would not see it but it didn t matter a the guest had quite gently put it i own the damn company who booked my room you jackass but the night auditor would not let this defeat go lightly the next morning the front desk manager called the night auditor and asked what happened after being regaled with this tale the manager explained that it wa not the first time they had trouble with this guest and that hopefully this time the guest would follow through with his threat to never set foot in this hotel again so far it ha been precisely year and month since the guest last stayed in the night auditor s realm which wa precisely that fateful night in the end mr lonely businessman showed himself to be not only a shrewd businessman conquistador of heart master tactician but ultimately a man who follows through with his threat edit quickly added a tl dr fixed minor mistake in grammar and writing

hello boy i m baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack tonight wa supposed to be a quiet night at my little schmoliday out i ve been spending most of my night either redditing or studying okay mostly redditing most of my guest had been checked in and i wa just lounging behind the desk when boooooooooooooop a fire emergency ha been detected in the building yep the fire alarm went off now my first reaction wa to call the fire department then my manager so that s exactly what i did meanwhile my aviation training kicked in for what re called in the industry memory item one of which is to call for help so the first thing i did wa call to report it after that i called my manager and told him about it and about the same time the kitchen called to say it wa just a false alarm however by then the truck were already rolling so i had our maintenance guy go silence the alarm when all wa said and done two police officer and eight or nine firefighter entered the hotel and secured it before leaving five minute later in total the whole thing lasted about minute and that s how my first fire alarm went i m just surprised it took this long to do it since i ve been working here for about seven month
the hotel i worked at would occasionally do cool thing with the local community one project involved working with outreach group to bring in special need folk to work in housekeeping to be clear there wa no exploitation or anything like that there wa a lot of effort put in by both hotel and outreach staff to make the program work team of people would work short shift cleaning room with a social worker helping supervising they may or may not be able to actually perform task depending on the individual but they were out in the world doing stuff based upon what i observed for the folk involved it wa a positive experience one reason i remember it positively wa because of a girl on a room cleaning team who would periodically utter a very loud hooo during her shift this would occur about every twenty minute i don t know exactly why she did it but she wa pretty much like clockwork think of the stevie nick song white winged dove sings a song sound like she s singing ooo ooo ooo that middle ooo wa very much the tone and timbre of that young lady s vocalization it didn t ascend or descend or sound like a question just kind of a short loud somewhat musical hooo the hotel featured a large five story central atrium with wing of room spoking off each corner any noise in the atrium or down one of the wing reverberated well through the entire front of the house especially those loud chronic hooo s several time some typical potentially stressful front desk daytime baloney would be unfolding only to be disrupted by a loud hooo echoing through the hotel passing guest would often stop in their track and look up and around trying to figure it out if they looked at me i would usually just do the same and then shrug over time the hooo became a helpful reminder that some thing are silly and some thing are important and sometimes important thing can be a little silly i certainly think of that person and her hooo every time i sing along to that song go on do it hooo

seriously this blow my mind still i ve recently quit my fd job at a hotel i loved and a slight part of me is wondering if i ve made the right decision some backstory my hotel is under new management i got thrown into an fdm position in december and the bar manager is supposedly the new agm even tho it wa never officially announced by the new gm i ve never cared for the new agm since day she trained me when i initially got hired at the bar and some of the first word out of her mouth were how she s the best bartender in town and that she purposely make drink stronger because it get her more tip to me that s theft but it wa never my place to say anything about it when the new management took over my feeling about her had gotten back to her which is a whole other stupid as story i sat down with her and apologized to her but i also told her i felt like she didn t like me either and that s why i may have been awkward around her but this bitch instead of maybe saying i m sorry you felt that way or whatever instead said well i ve been searching for your apology i m a very professional and approachable person umm lol okay she s not really approachable by the way she talk like she s permafried and ha a resting bitch face like the world is sour but i did what i had to do because i wa really excited about the new management and the future of the hotel i wanted to move forward cut to valentine s day weekend my husband and i had a plan for a couple of month to go out of town and visit his sister and her boyfriend i requested the time off at the beginning of january well before new management wa a whisper in anyone s ear i wasn t actually supposed to come home until monday but i told my husband we need to come home a day early so i could be at these important leadership meeting on monday morning so we leave sunday morning and i actually had to call the hotel because the schedule i made had gone missing and i mentioned to fd that i wa on my way home roll around minute before the second shift come in fd ugh this guy i feel for him but he hasn t been reliable since he s started and he got the job because he s best friend with agms boyfriend so anyways his car break down on the way to work he call agm and let her know because he saw that i wa out of town otherwise he would ve called me agm then text me asking me to come in because my other fd worker fd and if you will fd had church and fd wasn t available i basically had to tell her twice that no i wa not coming in i felt like a huge asshole for it really i fucking did but i had also requested a day off at the beginning of the month that i couldn t even take because of these new leadership meeting by the way the meeting that day consisted of me eating a hot dog sitting there for about minute waiting going around to the cold pool for a quick announcement and watch the new gm jump in monday morning i run to my hotel to clock in before going to the meeting and fd tell me that fd the one who simply couldn t come in actually did come in around i go to the meeting see agm and tried to apologize to her and told her i felt like a dick this bitch wasn t having any of it this whole situation lead to an argument between me and agm that a fdm i should ve handled it or had been willing to come in which i would ve but the call didn t come to me what also blow my mind is that there wa coverage i m sorry but jesus will forgive you fd for missing one night of church and fd wa supposedly also a couple of hour away i say supposedly because fd already ha strongly expressed to me how uncomfortable she is working sunday night because it s so dead so why would you ask someone who requested the time off who s also a couple of hour away to come in instead the way i see it is that it s completely irrelevant what i wa spending my time off doing or where i may have been going to or coming from if someone tell me they ve requested some time off a long a there s coverage they ll have it it s none of my business what you re doing on your time off you could simply need a day for your mental health i don t care you get that whole day and you won t hear anything from me unless the hotel is burning down agm even tried to say well i ve had to do thing for work when i ve requested time off which is just crazy no one should have to do that and even if work ha to follow you home you have the right to turn your shit off for a few hour and take a break i didn t quit because of this one situation but this wa strike for me with agm and i just can t work with her am i overreacting i just felt like my requested time off wasn t respected by anyone and i would never ask someone to come in if they ve requested the time off my former coworkers might read this but i don t give a fuuuuuuuuuuck
so over this entire shift i ve had my confidence in my position shaken by one individual and a lot of people here i ve been doing some self reflection and i m not so sure about what i m doing anymore but every time i think about it it come down to one thing i wasn t made for this job that s the truth of the matter i ve always been isolated and to say i m not empathetic is putting it lightly i ve always been a very cold and distant person looking through my last post reveals a much interacting with others isn t something i m good at whether it be or in fact i dread whenever someone come through the door i hate whenever thing go wrong i can t talk like a normal person whenever someone ha an issue i m a relatable a a robot and whenever i get mad it s obvious the facade is transparent and it s a wonder i made it this far with such a transparently fake face the pressure of every mistake coupled with how little i know is weighing down on me every shift i fear i ll be scolded for something wrong and tonight is no exception this job started out a such an easy job but it just go to show that a small hurdle can derail a train i remember that after i hit the first month mark i already wanted to leave i assumed that it wa because i didn t like the place i wa working in but i wa wrong the constant fear wasn t from the hotel i worked in it wa because of my pathetic customer service skill if i wa a fallout character my charisma stat would be i plan on talking to my bos i want to know if there s another position i can fill in that doesn t have my interacting with the public i remember when i first posted my story here someone said maybe you re just not cut out for customer service i hate admitting i m wrong but all the people who told me that were just predicting the future in the end they were right i wasn t made for customer service job so maybe it s time for a reality check thanks everyone for everything i might return a a person who recount tale second hand but i think my time a a night auditor is done i give myself week max before i actually leave unless i somehow manage to convince myself to stay but i feel like i need to be honest with myself this job is hell my sleep schedule is shit my work ethic are trash and i m not good at one of my primary function i guess that s all i had to say it feel better to get that all off my chest thanks for reading if you did
a bit of backstory i m a supervisor and a server but primarily a server thus when one of our primary morning supervisor desperately needed her shift covered i wa the only available person that could cover that shift no problem our floor wa experienced and reliable and our gm wa gonna come in an hour after i arrived so no issue i wish both host and an expeditor no call no show great then my gm reveals that he s gonna be late yay so now we have the person in charge of dessert and specialty drink sitting the door and i m covering her job then the take out window get super backed up and i need to take phone call while the take out person pack the order no problem shit the dessert window is backed up with ice cream order gotta do that then when just a i wa getting everything into a rhythm i need to talk to table about why her food is cold shit i forgot i m the mod a well this is a disaster a late server arrives and spring an idea on me yo purplepain i m certified to make drink and dessert let me take that station over and just adjust the floor plan i doubt the server will mind having more table so while i m busy a hell one of my server who s been dying to take charge break out the new floor plan and our server are hustling then our second take out person show up and square that station away while there re over delivery and to go order suddenly all i m doing is cleaning table and running food whilst helping when needed and the shift wa humming like a well oiled machine with half a many host and with a server cranking out drink and dessert with headphone in that s when the gm show up hour late and is so impressed with how the shift is running that he hide in the office for the rest of the shift my server truly made me look great that shift all credit go to them
small annoyance that shouldn t bother me a much a it should when i ask a guest if they have a reward number and they reply with it s already on file why on earth would i ask for it if it wa already there a man just hit me with that response and when i again said i didnt have it he just condescendingly laugh roll his eye and dig through his phone to find it the whole rest of the check in he wa being a rude grouch because i inconvenienced him i really just dont understand some people
at first i thought this manager wa just one of those power hungry rose up the ladder kind of guy so i didn t think to much about it i figured he treated me just like he treated everyone else but i wa wrong he literally nit pick everything and tell me i do everything wrong yell at me for the smallest thing and always threatens me to write me up for anything say when he wa a server this that first let me tell you about myself i rarely break the rule i don t like getting in trouble and i respect everyone i always go above and beyond for this company who could care le and could replace me easily when my coworkers or other manager hear that i got yelled at they are surprised because they know i don t act out anyways this manager follows me around waiting to see if i do something he disapproves and it s uncomfortable i feel like i always have to be looking over my shoulder and i see his looking even if i m just chatting with coworkers when it s slow we have a strict dress code policy which i follow but a a very petite female that s hard i had to get dress pant from the kid section because adult dress pant don t fit well and kid dress pant are different from adult they always have to put some weird zipper here or since it s kid clothes it s tighter than normal in certain area for the whole two week i wa going to different store to find it he would pick at me every day in insert how many day left of the wks i had to find dress pant i get to write you up and he would tell me i m not looking and being lazy he even told me just because dress pant is in the dress pant section it doesn t make it dress pant i had to go to my gm and show him the struggle of finding dress pant in the adult section so i got a pas for my kid dress pant this manager try to send me home if i have a spot on my dress pant but let s other people come work in sweatpants or legging that s when i saw the difference in behavior we also recently have a new party policy where or more guest we have to split the party which mean we have to split tip and it sometimes suck i noticed i m always one of the server who get stuck taking party when he s manager i always asked why is it my section get closed off minute and he always say well we need to sit a party there but other section would be open or he would make me take party if it s not even in my section i would take it without saying anything because again it s my job we also have a new no phone policy at work he let other people use phone but if i take my phone out for emergency he tell me he will write me up and send me home even though i told him it wa for emergency he know i don t like confrontation or getting in trouble so he always throw it in my face that he ha the power to write me up i also had asthma since i wa and i get sick not a lot but a good amount of time my other manager are understanding but when i tell this manger i need to take my inhaler or nebulizer he think i m lying to get out of work he just straight up told me if i m really that sick i shouldn t work for then anymore it s gotten to the point where i tell other server i don t respect him a a manager anymore they see how he treat me and yell at me and they ask how do i put up with it they just see me take it and it anger them to let someone walk all over me again i don t like getting in trouble so i don t know what to do he s also in charge of picking who get what section which is why i m always in the party section not only that he like to give up my section to someone else if i m not in the party section for once and make me food run or put me in the party section i ve talked to other manager how the section work and they say it s based on rotation but i m always back there and other have noticed it i consider myself a good server and can make up to working double but lately i ve been making all day because of taking party all day and it s taking a toll honesty the easiest thing would be to get a new job but i love my coworkers they really are like family and my other manager are very understanding it s only one manager that for some reason ha it out for me i don t know what to do
so i ve always despised valentine s day found it overly cheesy and commercial and while love is an awesome thing i find that valentine s day is a dreadful way of celebrating it i m also a server which make it a prime day for money so i ll usually trade shift with coworkers looking to celebrate with their significant others then schedule something low key with the beloved so this year i devised a devilish plan to make the whole darned thing far more bearable for me at least and provide me with high quality chuckle i went on spotify and created a playlist i compiled about ish of the schmaltziest cheesiest french love song out there i live in a french speaking region it s not unusual or weird however i also inserted some tragic super depressing song about misfortune in love hearbreak and sadness so while most of the night wa kitschy love song every once in a while there d be some super depressing song that played only a customer or two actually noticed many complimented me on how nice the playlist wa but everytime george brassens sang il n y a pa d amour heureux there is no happy love i felt super vindicated anyways this is the tale of how a server of year beloved by his customer turned into a valentine s day grinch
train attendant here wa on my least favorite route which is a slow moving cheaper overnight train on a very long line you d think this would be the quietest route possible right w r o n g i ve never been assigned to one of these route without some sort of problem this is the best sub to tell the story imho this story occured in the middle of monsoon so everything wa heavily flooded this meant in addition to already being a slow ride amp long shift we were far slower than usual too where i m from also ha lot of earthquake the rail system is considered to be particularly sensitive to earthquake while we do have an earthquake early warning system and system designed to protect train in these event it s not a advanced a country like japan we occasionally have false alarm sometimes the train protection system make situation worse instead of better sometimes it deploys too late occasionally they don t deploy at all we re around pm at this point i have different people angry at me that i had to cut them off from drinking have a car with leaky cabin that i had to move people out of and way more people are awake then i d like to deal with we re headed towards a tunnel i feel the throttle cut suddenly break being slowly applied this is the typical reaction to an earthquake alert but there is no earthquake alert audio warning also note we re stopped in a tunnel we can t connect via intercom to the driver cab in fact the staff phone aren t working at all we didn t have any knowledge of this being an earthquake in this situation we re supposed to report to the driver cab i m about halfway up the train a few minute later when that alert come out first on my phone then over the pa and we get a decent quake went on for maybe or minute we end up having to do safety inspection of the train all good right nope passenger are absolutely loosing their mind we ended up being stopped for minute with aftershock and safety inspection it caused water to get into several car by time we got started again we were inundated with crazy upset passenger we went through nearly all the alcoholic drink we had within an hour of that event ended up having to move more passenger had one become violently sick a mental health event and drug incident it wa at this point the ac decided to go out for the entire train and we ran more hour with no ac at c in the train with humidity outside amp soggy air

i work in a large chain hotel in a fairly popular city my location is in a pretty convenient spot so usually people who want to explore the city without paying the downtown rate will stay with u our sale team also ha deal with those wonderful sport team like the hockey baseball and wrestling kid who all come with their set of rich drunk entitled parent my first encounter wa with the hockey team parent staying for day for their championship game the entire hotel staff wa losing their shit about this group all the way from houseman housekeeper up to the manager and sale team they were all warning me about how awful these group can be and acting like a war wa coming but i just brushed it off thinking it couldn t possibly be so bad i have never been so wrong in my life for day there were child running through every single hallway on the floor of our hotel drunk parent in the pool the hot tub the breakfast area and the meeting room none watching the child so guess what the fda became babysitter why do we have to be babysitter you ask because the child were in room by themselves jumping on bed playing on staircase slamming every damn door they went through running from the pool to the lobby soaking wet and soaking the hallway floor and the best one of all walking on the wall of the terrace that is story high and would kill them when they fell not a sober parent in sight i feel so bad for these kid their parent see these event a big vacation and pay no attention to the kid bc they re all too drunk to give a damn however the child aren t even the worst part of the story it the suburban entitled parent who think that bc they have a bit of money can get whatever they want so game day come which also happens to be the team check out date checkout time is pm and check in time for new guest is pm so am roll around and one of the mother s call me it is the lead mother the ultimate karen and the conversation go like this karen hi i wanted to see if we could get a pm check out my last name is me look up the file and see shes part of the team of room okay i see you re with the hockey group did you need that for just your room k no we need it for the whole team we just won the championship and were gonna go get lunch to celebrate me i m sorry ma am check out time is pm and we re sold out for tonight so we need to get those room cleaned and ready for the next guest i can t give all of you late check out k what are you talking about we just won the championship game i m letting my kid celebrate and we re not even packed yet me congrats on the win but unfortunately we can t accommodate a late stay today if you re not out by pm you re all getting charged a late check out fee and if you try for pm you re going to be charged a half night stay have a good day ma am click they didn t show up until after didn t leave til almost so i charged them all most of them declined a paper receipt or just walked past and threw the key on the desk rude a hell btw so the fee remained i know we got a few call about it in the following day but we just explained the policy and how we told a woman on the team and she didn t listen most people kind of went huh okay then and didn t fight it too much so we assume that karen lied and said they all could have the late check out we re hoping she wa attacked and shunned but i suppose the world will never know
tonight s been a slow one so far the university group have been in house for a week and i ve had no complaint from them which is a miracle since they always find something to complain about outside of a woman literally looking down her nose when i gave her a rate foreign lady with a heavy air of self importance nothing really noticeable ha happened save for one guest who checked in this guy came in with a third party reservation and wanted to check in no problem just need a card and an id i launch into my usual banter with the guest and since he s local he tell me he wanted to do something special for his fiance since he wa working yesterday and didn t have a chance i blushed since that s the sweetest thing i ve heard working at the desk he take his key go up to the room and decorates and the fiance show up a few minute later i had a key waiting for her after verifying the id she go up best thing i ve seen in a long time here well at least it wa the best thing since those canadian angel who came through last week so there you have it an uplifting tale on a dark weekend

i m a server at sushi place in an asian shopping center since the majority of our customer are asian and we have maybe people max working at a time it s fairly authentic and straightforward most people know what they want and just want friendly professional service now i ve encountered my fair share of entitled folk in other serving job but only in diner and other familiar american place at this point i m kinda baffled a to why karen type venture out of tgichilibees because any kind of foreign food seems to upset them and provoke their behavior worse than anywhere i ve ever served before yesterday i had two lady come in for lunch l and l they re giving off automatic cranky vibe but that s cool i ll just try and be extra positive i go over to introduce myself and they don t even skip a beat before flying into karen mode i get their iced tea extra extra lemon light ice come back for order l order chicken teriyaki we don t serve teriyaki it s nowhere on the menu no we can t make it special for you we don t even have a grill back there so l is pissed sigh order cali roll and udon soup i m the only server busser cashier and l order a shit ton of nigiri and decides to play a very aggressive round of question with me if ya ll serve ya ll know not honest question to get answer question like they re trying to prove you wrong or catch you lying l point at condiment what s this me that s eel sauce it s like sweet teriyaki it s used for cooking eel l is there eel in it me no ma am it s just commonly served on eel l i just don t want to eat eel me it ha no eel in it ma am l well then why is it called eel sauce then like babygirl i promise on my life i m not trying to sneak anything by you we re not debating i m just trying to help you this weird questioning go on for everything from the tea flavor to the japanese menu term to the exact hotness of hot sake and i end up weeded on what should be a chill day because of all the extra demand from just them when they re finished i notice there s a few half eaten item ask if they want a box hope it s not a complaint sweet baby jesus of course it is they just tried some new thing and didn t like them and want them comped corporate place i know hand out comp like candy but this is family owned and the chef manager definitely doesn t play that especially with expensive shit like sushi it s a small place so i m witness to the most uncomfortable argument between l l and the chef while trying to help other guest who are all watching this unfold nothing get comped i ring them up they re complaining the whole time about never coming back and some diet racist shit about the chef being cheap at least the rest of my table were absolute peach by the way they ended up loving that fucking eel sauce

so i got secret shopped and i vividly remember him because he informed me he wa taking food home for his wife and she had a black pepper allergy so nothing could touch pepper in the kitchen or she will get very ill so when he arrives he had no menu on the table which indicates he sat himself but in the report he said a hostess sat him but he didn t know her name then i go to greet him and give him my intro and he wa quick to cut me off i then recommended some apps his wife could eat but when i went to the kitchen i wa informed there wa pepper so i went back and told him that i couldn t do that one so i offered steamed veggie he agreed to the steamed veggie and i got it sent out first in the report he mention he wa upset that steamed veggie came a an app he then order the most expensive item on our menu and i ensure there is no seasoning at all and he seemed fine we had shift change so i had to transfer him to another server who he also failed when i read the report he said nothing about his pepper allergy i had to work around and said i offered no appetizer when i went out of my way to offer some without pepper he said i didn t smile and said i didn t greet him for min which is not true this whole experience is going to mess with me because i am about to get promoted into a management position and i feel it s going to get ripped away my manager haven t mentioned it but i m guessing we will discus it tomorrow i know i m not a perfect server and i did forget to bring coaster so that wa accurate but i m not okay with a shopper blatantly lying on the report what do i do i m stressin

most of the time i see a parent yelling at their kid in public they re the one causing a scene and being more immature than their child your kid is probably misbehaving because you clearly don t know how to parent and discipline them affectively i had a table today of dad and their son around year old when they were ready to order the dad were trying to get the kid to tell me what they want but the kid didn t really know what they wanted and their dad were snapping at them and trying to rush them along i told them twice i could just come back if they re not ready and they said no and told me to stay there so i stood there for minute while they aggressively flipped through their child s menu frantically pointing at shit and pushing their head towards to menu telling them to look at them one of them grabbed his son straw from his hot chocolate and threw it at the kid head and he got whipped cream all in his hair wtf oh and at the beginning when they were ordering drink it wa the same deal the dad were trying to rush the kid along and aggressively yelling drink option to them trying to get them to choose and the kid were clearly overwhelmed and flustered by all the choice being yelled at them one of the option they gave the kid wa milkshake and the kid didn t say they wanted that but the dad said milkshake ok milkshake before the kid even answered and i said we don t have milkshake and they yelled at the kid and said they don t have milkshake clearly annoyed at them even though they re the fucking one who brought up milkshake i spoke really softly and nice to the kid the rest of the time and wa stone cold to the dad they kept saying really unfunny joke to me and being flirtatious a if i wa going to be flattered by these beer bellied shitty father

so we had a front desk meeting today sunday our last meeting wa very unfocused and largely pointless it wa a waste of payroll and time i wa already annoyed that i got off at had to come back hour later for a meeting and then come back for my shift tonight i slept maybe hour all day anyway since i wa annoyed at this and at the last meeting i left my manager a long assed letter with thing that i would love it if they addressed i m happy to say that she incorporated the entire thing into the meeting i ve been at this for far too many year i ve picked up some tip and trick along the way i had to interject with correction on some of the other thing that were being discussed and apparently stumped everyone with some of the thing i taught them not to toot my own horn because most desk clerk get shitty training but everything i know how to do in this system i taught myself and i seem to know more than my higher ups then it happened we finished up the meeting i wa showing everyone random thing on the workstation and my manager pulled me aside and asked me to write the training manual i need to learn to shut the hell up sometimes i ve ended up writing the manual for every property i ve been at but no system ha ever been the same so it s like starting from scratch every time
i wasn t working the shift it happened but that afternoon i got the whole story about his checkout backstory he stayed with u for about two week quiet guy didn t really leave his room aside from to stop housekeeper in the hall for fresh towel and to request no service to his room from time to time he had food and alcohol delivered to him so we didn t really see him at the desk you know the usual just want his privacy kinda guy finally housekeeping decided his room absolutely needed to be cleaned due to a smell in the hallway near him we thought maybe someone tracked in dog poo because we had some in house also because he hadn t had service in so long gm called his room and explained that we needed to change out his sheet etc in the morning and if he wanted we could change his room if he didn t want to be bothered he say okay my relief come in full of hope for her usual quiet hour shift then he call he s checking out she get his bill ready for him and notice a car pull up outside the exit near his room and see him get into it and leave i don t know what made her want to check his room but she did vomit feces everywhere they found about empty alcohol can a clogged toilet sink and tub drain feces smeared everywhere tile in the bathroom the carpet part of the bed it wa a mess it looked like he had tried to clean it up with our towel thankfully he had a credit card on file that had a very generous fee charged to in damage
my guest had a steak entrecote medium and cooked to perfection in my eye the next table also ordered entrecote they arrived only a few minute apart the steak looked like twin they were so perfect now guest no decides that his steak is an abomination worst steak he ha ever seen there s even a streak of fat through it impossible to eat horrible please take that disgusting thing away meanwhile guest no is trying to enjoy his steak tell me it is cooked to perfection juicy and melt in the mouth guest tell him that he doesn t know what he is taking about that no steak should have fat in it and that he should send his steak back too guest try to defend his steak literally tried to move it a far away from guest a he could part of me wa sad that guest wa unhappy part of me wa laughing my sock off at this comedy sketch this also happens when guest complain that the portion are too big no normal person could ever eat all of that while on the next table a little year old lady ha just polished off the same dish and now feel ashamed for being so greedy please don t try to shame other guest over their choice sorry can t correct my title
i started training yesterday a a waiter and it s my first job ever it s only the second day but i almost cried today and i want to quit the thing is the owner ha an accent that s kind of thick and she speaks quietly sometimes and i have awful hearing so that make everything worse she seems so impatient sometimes or annoyed when i don t understand concept immediately for the most part i understand the basic but i m still trying to work out the finer detail and find my flow if that make sense there s just so much to remember i really feel like it s not possible to learn it all at once like today i didn t check up on table often enough forgot to refill water and forgot which sauce went in a certain bowl the sushi chef tried to give me advice but he also ha an accent and doesn t speak the best english he called the owner over and they started arguing not in english and i felt so freaking awkward and embarrassed i try to ask question but they don t seem to understand god it s like i can feel their annoyance with me sometimes or maybe my anxiety is making that up i don t mind english not being their first language that s whatever but it s really creating this language barrier between u when it come to explaining certain concept i think for the most part my mind is already made up mainly because my friend who also work there say the owner amp sushi chef argue often the owner never compliment her and will even get on her about mistake in front of customer or is all this normal and i m just not cut out to be a server
i work in a bistro the restaurant section of a pub last night a popular band wa playing so we were fully booked had a couple walk in without a booking begging for a table anywhere we could fit them they just wanted half an hour to have a drink i double check our booking to confirm that one table is actually free they immediately ask for one of the booked booth i check my booking again those reservation are too close for me to double up couple get stroppy and settle for the table after much pouting oh and they ordered food and several round of drink so definitely not half an hour and one drink
a far a humblebrags go i think the worst one a person could settle for is calling themselves a well known trash expert but that s where i m at with my life now i don t mean i m some kind of nuanced expert in trash s finer point of debauchery but rather i am regarded at work a the one person who is unafraid of trash and am regularly sent to deal with garbage related issue specifically the location of item i began this reputation a while back when an unknown guest took the metal spoon used for the brown sugar dispenser to apparently eat their oatmeal with we could say the guest just wanted a real spoon for their oatmeal instead of the cheap plastic cutlery but the spoon never reappeared i had a hunch that whoever the guest wa wasn t intentionally stealing the spoon but rather someone absent minded who had taken it used it and thrown it away with the rest of their paper and plastic good so i pulled out my glove and dug through the trash and located the spoon i did so the next day a well a we never managed to catch when the spoon went missing or who in the breakfast room wa using it in time my co worker thought the notion of trasher hunting wa disgusting but so long a they weren t the one who had to do it they were grateful to have the spoon returned from then on i ve been walkied quite a few time to locate item people usually guest have potentially lost in the trash typically thing like retainer that get easily chucked in the bin if you aren t thinking about it well today a guest stopped our house keeping supervisor lily and asked about a harry potter cup that had gotten thrown out by housekeeping the man seemed kind of flustered and sad so it wa hard for her to understand what he wa describing but she understood a guest item might have been thrown away so lily asked the woman who cleaned his room carla but she couldn t recall throwing away a guest s cup by that point i had already taken carla s trash from her cart just something i do everyday a a favour to the housekeeper around ish so they don t end up with super heavy trash and don t have to lose time bringing it down themselves so it wa in our inside dumpster already basically a big black cart in the laundry room lily approached the inside dumpster and thought one of the bag wa carla s so she tried to take a look but saw a diaper at the top and rethought that choice then a they all do eventually she came to me she asked if i wa willing to take a quick look for a harry potter cup but she didn t have any clue what it looked like she said i probably don t want to though because carla s trash wa particularly filthy looking but kelly from the front desk just shouted over she ll do it she s the trash queen which sound stupid a i m typing it out but it wa a solid compliment at the time folk lily and the other fda holly however both told me it s gross and i don t have to do it and it s not my job to have to do that but i said it s no trouble and i d go take a look the thing is though i love doing this kind of stuff not sifting through dirty diaper obviously but finding thing there is no greater high on earth to me than the thrill of locating a lost possession i used to work at a library and there wa a list of missing book they kept for the staff to try and locate in their spare time and i found in month i wa obsessed with it i had all these tip and trick for how to best do it but really the only trick is i m just to stubborn to quit so of course i wa gung ho for this expedition to search for the unknown a guest needed my help i got to feel useful and helpful and hopefully make them happy and that s the best quest on earth i located carla s bag in the inside dumpster and pulled it out but the bag wa pretty full and pretty filthy so i got a spare bag and took the whole project out to the outside dumpster where i parked myself and dug in the bag wa mostly filled with smaller bag of trash from the room so i pulled those out inspected them then moved them to the clean trash bag i didn t really know what i wa looking for but i knew carla wouldn t have thrown out an actual cup she obviously know the difference between guest item and trash so it had to be something that could be mistaken for trash i d been to the wizarding world of harry potter before so i figured it might be one of those flimsy plastic butterbeer cup instead though near the bottom of the whole bag wa a cheap plastic bottle that read gilly water i knew the second i saw it that s what the guest wa talking about it had to be people throw away the cup usually but i know for a fact people love to hoard these gilly water bottle because they re kinda cute and they weren t expensive and if you didn t buy anything else they re a nice souvenir so i washed it well then off i popped to the front desk where kelly and holly greeted me with cheer a i came in holding the bottle and explaining what it wa a neither of them had any idea what it wa or why it mattered they both agreed they would have thrown it out too i walkied lily to tell her i had found her mysterious missing cup but right then carla came out the elevator and kelly playfully ragged on her forcing me to go dumpster diving to find what she threw away carla lit up and just said you found it it s his and pointed to a guest who happened to be just entering the elevator the man did a quick turn and lit up when he saw the gilly water bottle in my hand he wa so nice and obviously understanding of how it had gotten thrown away it being really just an empty plastic water bottle he thanked me a kindly a if i d returned a family heirloom and said his daughter wa going to be so happy before he headed upstairs the best part of finding something is returning it to whoever wa looking for it that smile of recognition is the purest and loveliest thing in the world and i felt all warm and toasty inside a i resumed my regular work while i wa mopping however the man returned and stopped me he thanked me again for finding it and handed me a tip a dollar more than the bottle cost to begin with he told me about how sad his daughter had been when it had gotten thrown away and about how he know it s just a plastic water bottle but it mattered to her and she s just ecstatic to have it back even thought it s really just trash and i told him i absolutely get it it s a memento of good time and she wanted to keep it it doesn t matter how cheap it wa it wa wanted therefore it mattered he wa glad i understood and thanked me again before disappearing back into the elevator leaving me delighted all over i know i didn t solve world hunger or put a man on the moon but today i got to make a guest really really happy albeit through the power of dumpster diving and i think that s something all of u in hospitality genuinely want we want to make someone day because really it make ours too tl dr i gained a reputation at work for locating thing in the trash because i have a stupid addiction to finding missing shit but it earned me a tip today to go digging through dirty diaper to locate a plastic water bottle from universal studio because a daughter wa missing it very much

previous link http www reddit com r talesfromthefrontdesk comment f a our system is showing you have room heyla guy im back with an update on what happened first off i appreciate y alls response on the matter that happened unfortunately we at the fd level don t have access to turn off oversell but normally it never a crazy a it wa on saturday so we can usually handle it i do plan on mentioning it to my gm when he get back on monday if nothing already ha reached his ear about it now a far a to what happened after my auditor kicked me out of the hotel for the night according to him more shenanigan happened we had one more confirmed arrival that came in just a four more of these fax came through to our hotel all pre paid last minute and every single one of the people showed up roughly in the span of time they must have sent about or so of them they went off on my poor auditor they went off on the gentleman who wa trying to check in all demanding to know why the site wa showing room why we don t have room why this guy ha a room etc etc thankfully he wa able to fend them off and get them to call the rd party to get their refund afterwards he managed to get ahold of our fom about what happened and get that information passed to our hotel owner we have the stack of fax a evidence just encase around am we actually received a call from the rd party apologizing for what happened my guess for that not only did they get chewed out by a dozen or so of their customer our owner must have gotten a hold of them and burned them for that the second part is not confirmed only a hopeful guess of an fda cross finger and knock on wood they don t try this again any time soon
hello everybody my birthday wa yesterday and i spent it in germany to see some wonderful christmas market and drink some hot chocolate from a stall it wa very nice on our return to the hotel which btw i did not book through a third party but directly via the hotel site because i have read your story about pestcipedia and such there were some lovely little cake sitting on the desk with a hand written happy birthday message on a card that wa such a lovely surprise i have thanked the front desk people for it a couple of time and thank you all for the hard work you do too i appreciate it

i wa working at an italian restaurant at the time and that is when this group of people walked in they were sat down in my section and it wa just shy of the dinner rush to begin when they were seated and i greeted them that is when they told me that they are neighbor with my girlfriend of the time so they knew her well and have seen me before after that they all ordered either a shirley temple or raspberry tea both the drink i need to add a mixture and cannot be put in pitcher for easy refill at my restaurant while i went back to make their drink i sent a quick text to my girlfriend that they are in my section that is when i returned with all their drink they ordered the unlimited pasta special we had at the time this also came with and unlimited bread a well a a choice of soup or salad unlimited a well when i finished the order taking all of their drink were empty already this wa infuriating they were rude the entire time and made me refill something every time i have arrived at the table with the last refill i wa so busy that i had to tell the hostess that i cannot take another table this table made me so busy that i cannot even take a second table constant refill of the soup salad bread and pasta that i wa exhausted when they left it felt a if i just worked a freaking double shift and i have just arrived and only had them how can they eat so much freaking food now the kicker they were rude and with all my running around and them never being empty on anything for more than a few minute this i wa sure about a i wa gone from them for only a minute or two at a time to return with a new drink bread salad soup or pasta then had to run to refill something that wa gone again i got a tip freaking dollar for me not being able to take another table for over an hour and a half i wa super nice cause they were my girlfriend neighbor funny part she hate them i see why now
i m a server at a chain steakhouse that may or may not be associated with kangaroo i need to let this out somewhere this ha literally been the worst weekend i ve ever worked in a restaurant and i spent one valentine day at the damn melting pot valentine day itself we had server call in but still had a fairly smooth shift nobody wa overwhelmed server all had table apiece myself with and the host were pacing seating so the kitchen wa busy but not crashing the expo killed it everybody made money saturday we have server on with table section we generally have table section cue disgruntled server we get ton of big party all night so now the few server in area that can accommodate them are borrowing the free standing table from other server hence cutting those people down to table now they ve gone from grumbly to pissed off i have a section where the middle table is essentially unseatable it s a tiny top sandwiched between two bigger table people refuse to be seated there after hour i ve had four table all night my co worker are the same nearby they re in the high top bar area again which people don t want to sit in there s probably server who are actually busy amp the other of u are twiddling our thumb with our table at a time manager decides he s assigning sidework tonight now he s only worked here for about month most of the waitstaff ha been there for multiple year there s an established way of doing thing sidework is done by in time amp is assigned by the boh closer temper are already short amp this cause an uproar someone straight up era his sidework then writes it back in after realizing he wrote it knowing he ll lose his mind manager still see the changed handwriting amp straight up start screaming at everyone about it sunday only server but everyone is still short tempered hostess say she ll come in at doesn t show up which leaf u short an sa who is now hosting i keep getting double sat amp also sat outside of my section for some reason but it s alright at first then the food start going out on minute wait time great now the re cook start coming in i had a re cook on almost every single table and of them got sent back multiple time most table were pissed off one gentleman wa finding it comical and tipped because he felt bad for me this is happening on all my table plus every other server s table i couldn t get manager to talk to a table to save my life so i m trying to put out the fire alone the only interaction i can get with manager actually is for him to come back looking for one of my re cook the person who brought it back apparently hadn t written a ticket for it i did not know this i had verified the kitchen had the steak and that they knew what temp amp table it wa for they did logical to assume they have the ticket nope i still got screamed at by manager in the middle of re cook hell my camping top flag me down to say we still haven t gotten our birthday cake i just stared at the guy confused had they brought in a cake that the host forgot to tell me about i ask nope they re expecting a free dessert um ok well i can do a scoop of ice cream with hot fudge well she s allergic to that so don t you have a cake or anything we can have are you kidding me dude it s valentine weekend you can see the chaos and you re gonna sit here and demand special treatment i straight up told him i didn t have the authority to give away anything beyond ice cream and he gave a deep sad sigh amp gave up gtfo out of here dude i ve been working sick a fuck all weekend still running my as off amp being a team player i stop for second to shovel a few bite of salad in my mouth amp manager bark at me run some food there wa no fucking food to run this manager is a year old pot head and ha been desperately clawing at getting some authority lately since nobody respect him for some reason this wa my last straw mentally i m a grown as adult i can deem when it s an appropriate time to take a second break fuck off around pm our best grill guy say fuck you manager i m tired of being yelled at and walk out it s pm we close at it s just walk in now maybe a table every minute manager still ha five server on the floor he s making cut out of order a long time server get into a screaming match with him about him not knowing how to do his job correctly of u end up staying until because we were waiting on our single table we got given after there s existing drama about favoritism our entire management team is male all the bartender amp hourly manager are pretty female except for flamboyant gay guy the newest server year old cutesy little girl who think she s better than she is had never done anything but host before and got promoted within a month over a male sa of year who is arguably way more qualified in front of of u rolling silverware manager walk past with cutesy new server and loudly tell her good job tonight i m buying you dinner you worked hard i thought the host sitting there wa going to have an aneurysm he came in early because of the no show host amp didn t even get a thank you it definitely felt like a fuck you to the rest of u aaaaaaaaaaagh my so is a manager at another location amp advised me to put in for a transfer i don t know if that s an over reaction but fuck reddit

i m not sure this belongs here a it happen at a convenience with an attached deli made to order sandwich area no table or waitress waiter if someone think it belongs somewhere else please let me know so i can fix it i m on mobile so please excuse formatting mistake english is my first and only language this happened close to year ago so detail may not be exact i had an embarrassing but overall great experience when i covered for someone in the deli area i ran the register in a popular convenience store deli sandwich shop in pennsylvania that ha location in many state but most are in pennsylvania first time ever making a sandwich and it wa for the district manager dm no one told me we had horseradish sauce and regular horseradish i used regular when he had ordered sauce he took a big bite made kind of a face and said well that wa strong he knew i had never worked the deli before so he asked if i knew we had horseradish sauce and regular i think i must have gone a bit white at this he smiled and laughed and said he wa glad it wa his sandwich and not a customer s order i messed up on my manager wa ready to get in my face but the dm got in her face and asked why i hadn t been properly trained and shown the difference it wa just me in the deli for the first time ever with minimal training making hot dog stuffed pretzel coffee breakfast sandwich and the made to order sandwich salad trial by fire i guess i wa never asked to work the deli again but if they had actually shown me where everything wa i would have been fine i had worked at little caesar for year before this so it s not like i m food inept just needed to know that we had very similarly named igredients and topping for the sandwich dm you re awesome manager you need to train people better
i saw that a coworker of mine wa starting to split a top s check so i asked i could help out she had me check on one of her table that wa waiting on a side dish i approached the table and saw that both guest looked done with their meal and guest start exasperatingly asking about the side guest they ordered that dish minute ago now they have nothing to eat it with gesture toward partner s plate with a bit of side dish left on the plate me i m sorry we do make everything from scratch in house so it doe take time to prepare the food but i ll check with the kitchen and see if your food it ready partner well we did kind of order it late after our entree guest you didn t tell me it would take time cancel the side it s just way too late okay first i didn t tell you anything because this is the first time i ve ever seen you i m not your server but more importantly do you really think a potato dish in a cast iron skillet is just instantly ready at any moment i take a walk back to the hot line their order is fresh up and hot the ticket time is displayed in the window minute meaning i had been talking to them around minute after their order wa in whatever we take it off the bill and set the food aside for the bussers to smash after it start to die in the window the table ended up being nice because we err toward killing them with kindness at my place but i just can t believe how impatient people can be even at a nice sit down restaurant
okay weird thing going on at the moment so i don t know if this ha anything to do with the lie he told me but i m just going to clarify in case it doe a couple day ago i reported this same bos for an incident i heard about from another host about how he let a customer stay after they threatened to shoot up the place even though you re supposed to take every threat seriously and kick them out and yes the server who got threatened came up to him cry and told him what happened and he told her to let them stay i called corporate and filed a report against him anyways now that that s out of the way something very strange occurred today a couple day before today i got my automated text for my schedule and it sent out two different text one said i wa working today and the other said i wasn t so to be sure before i get all dressed up and come in only to be told i m not working today i called up the restaurant and asked my manager a i said before he s the same guy who i reported whether i wa working today or not and what wa going on with the automated text he told me i m not working today and that i wasn t going to work today because another manager fired one of the host not going to tell her name for privacy concern this didn t make any sense to me because why would i not work cause someone wa fired i don t know it would make more sense if he said she wa going to be fired but instead wasn t but he straight up said that she wa fired so anyways i texted the girl a couple hour later and asked why she wa fired and she said what are you talking about i m at work right now just what so i tell her that the manager whom i won t name either for privacy concern told me she wa fired a couple day ago and she said i wasn t why would he say that i don t know i just feel so off lately it made no sense why he lied about such a thing and i don t know if it ha anything in any way to do with my report i think i m just experiencing general anxiety this week and i just want to know if any of you have any clue what s going on i m semi new to the restaurant business i ve only been working here three month and it s my first restaurant job i know there s another host who s told me that this manager lie a lot but why why would he lie about this my first and only thought is maybe he s just a pathological or compulsive liar but if that s the case why would he lie about this when i would obviously find out at some point that she actually wasn t fired since i work with her ahhhh i don t know i just feel like i m going crazy this whole place is so weird and ha so much weird drama i m wondering if this is just the kind of people that restaurant job attract at this point haha

so i m working a the receptionist at an apartment house for context we have apartment in the building and they pretty much all different looking one also picture on booking site only display a couple of room because we cannot upload that many pic to include all one evening i get a call on the phone and this guy is asking about the apartment seen on one of those picture i tell him we cannot guarantee him the exact apartment he saw there and he agrees to come to our location so i can show him an apartment that is not occupied at the moment about an hour later arrives a really overweight guy with a gold chain thick a my finger around his neck and in gold adidas tracksuits with him come a tall bald and very muscular guy mind you this is in mid eastern europe but it is still an unusual sight a we usually have foreign guest but they were local the big guy begin to talk and we recognize each other a the one we talked to on the phone then we go and i show them an available apartment this actually is one of the nicest one a bit bigger than the usual and with more modern furniture the big guy really seems to like it but i notice that the other guy is completely silent the whole time and ha an expressionless face too which i found a bit wierd to begin with then we go back to the reception where they tell me that they need room for six night i assumed they need it for night because that is what these walk in guest want most of the time unfortunately the room i showed them is pre booked for that time so we go to see another room that is available for six night this room ha a bit older and more used furniture and also a bit smaller but it s the only available one for their time frame the big guy begin to criticize it and say thing like how cheap quality it is and that the price is too high for something like this i say that i m sorry and that this is our only available one for that time but he continues to say these kind of thing a he walk all around the apartment and in and out of the room this is still nothing unusual i dealt with the same kind of people a couple of time but then a the still silent other guy leaf the bathroom he asks me the question wa someone killed in there i wa already weirded out a bit by him so i gave a nervous laugh and answered that i do not know but probably not thinking it is a joke but then he say i m not joking after the big guy tell me that pete the silent guy is a medium and he feel these thing i repeat to pete that i don t think anyone wa murdered here or we would know about it he doe nkt seem to believe me and go back to the bathroom and suddenly grab the shower curtain and throw ot to the other side really quickly while with a sudden movement he look behind it after this he turn around and calmy and quietly say to me again that someone wa killed here he say they were stabbed with a knife i nervously smile and try to say repeat what i already told them before finally a they decide to leave a they do not like the apartment and to my relief they tell me they don t want to rent it a we go down in the elevator pete share another detail with u a teh big guy informs his gf over the phone that they won t be staying here pete confirms to the gf that indeed someone wa stabbed there with a knifr and he also tell that it happened last summer our company ha been the owner of that apartment for about ten year and nothing of this sort ha ever happened here but they were seriously concerned about this murder and it wa pretty absurd to see these tough looking guy believe this tl dr guy claim he is a medium and he can sense that there wa a murder in one of our apartment got a bit long sorry about that had too much time at work happy holiday

last night we had a guest email me and my general manager stating he never coming back to our hotel and will be giving u a bad rating because our tv s defaulted to cnn once they are turned on he then gave instance where cnn had been accused or proven to broadcast false information he obviously copied and pasted it because the email would have been page if we printed it out nothing wa wrong with our product or service but the tv channel pissed him off in a big way ugggg really i shot back an email stating we would investigate whether this wa a brand standard it turn out a default to a major news network is a brand standard but not the actual channel we also found out it would cost to change the default in our room hotel i updated him stating we would change to the weather channel there is a chance we will not due to the expense dude wa a first time guest with a company that have never stayed here before what an as
at least every or so month the owner of our restaurant add about or new item to the menu in hope to start making more money and bringing in new customer but every time he doe this he end up taking these item off the menu no more than week later just cause he doesn t want to anymore or he think it s costing him more money than it s making him well he just did it again and just like all the other time he s done it we get complaint from customer he come in for about an hour once a week that s literally it and it s u who ha to deal with the angry customer when he pull this bullshit the only reason we re still in business is because there is only like restaurant to choose from in our small town but we just keep losing more and more customer from his stupid impulse decision sorry just had to rant about it if y all have any cray owner story i would love to hear them right now

i work at a chain pizza place a a delivery driver but since these incident happened in store this story fit here better instead of r talesfromthepizzaguy we have been incredibly busy lately which mean longer make time and more flared temper i work in a delivery carryout store so there is no dine in area this past friday night wa brutal for multiple reason and we had to make two massive order on top of all the usual friday night chaos one of these wa free my store is the busiest for our chain in my city and we have one of the highest percentage of shitheel customer that come with it in the middle of the rush a guy came in to pick up his food and he like everyone else had to wait for it because both oven were running and full to the brim with food and the lobby wa full of people he paid for his food then noticed the girl making the food wasn t wearing glove and went absolutely ballistic we are not required to wear glove if we wash our hand every time we change station which we do he demanded a refund and starting berating the girl with everything he could think of insulting her look her family and a lot more now this girl ha done time several time for drug charge and is not one to back off when you piss her off fortunately for everyone involved she is aware of this and after a shouting match where they both told each other to fuck off walked out the front door to cool off wordlessly inviting him to continue the fight outside if he so desired the guy still wasn t happy but he took his refund and the food so i guess he wasn t too upset about the food being contaminated a he put it about an hour later a woman ordered a delivery online then decided she wanted to pay with a credit card so she called to do it the credit card declined and she immediately accused the woman taking her info of stealing her money i wa the driver up on the rotation to take her delivery and no one informed me of any of this until afterwards so i went out to her house assuming it wa a cash order when no one answered the door or the phone i waited out the five minute i m required to wait before coming back when i arrived the woman whose food i had wa screaming in the face of the cashier about stealing her money while her son filmed the entire confrontation she also said the cop were on the way so if they just refunded her now everything would be swell a she hadn t been charged we could not refund her and she didn t like that when the cop arrived she and the manager went outside to deal with the cop and while she didn t get arrested she didn t get her refund either unlike the first guy she also didn t get her food towards the end of the night we were all just wanting to go home and since we had a mountain of dish and we had to prep dough for the next night nobody bothered making more dough for the same night once we started selling out of stuff at around a woman came in to place a counter order and she made quite clear she wanted it on regular hand tossed dough which we were out of we sell thin dough hand tossed dough and deep dish pan dough pan dough cost more than the other two i wa working the counter and informed the customer we were out of the hand tossed but still had pan and thin she didn t want the thin and got incredibly upset about the one dollar upcharge for the pan she said her mother wa in the parking lot and it wa her birthday and she wanted hand tossed blah blah blah the manager ultimately compromised by saying to ring it up a a hand tossed but they d give her a pan which the woman accepted then she decided her mother wanted extra cheese which cost two dollar extra which she wa more than happy to pay for so that wa my friday night i m used to customer getting upset about random shit but never more than once a night

so this is like super old but i ve just been thinking about it for the last couple week because wow wa it dramatic so backstory on this is that we had this girl working morning shift we ll call her annika because her accent always made me think of russia despite her not being russian that had been hired by our previous fom right before she finally left the company she d been working on getting everything set for her to leave for month which led her to hiring a bunch of staff that were not great at their job by the end because she just didn t care i think i ve got a post on this subreddit somewhere that talk about our auditor who wa hired during this time annika had claimed to have previous experience working in our brand a a manager we ll call it shmilton and that she knew the operating system event shortly after she wa hired seemed to prove otherwise such a letting someone in without any form of payment because well she said it wa supposed to be on point can t we just call at the time i wa working part time a front desk and part time a the weekend am driver that is am to noon and we were scheduled to have two people on morning shift at all time plus the driver now our good friend annika wa not a fan of driving the shuttle despite it being listed a part of her job she wasn t really a fan of a lot of thing she wouldn t even acknowledge the housekeeper when they said hi to her but she wa especially not a fan of the shuttle in fact one week before the pivotal moment that would cement her future at our company or lack thereof she proceeded to get into a screaming fit with the only manager on duty housekeeping hilariously about me going on lunch without checking with her first despite there being no shuttle scheduled a second person on the desk and my sixth hour fast approaching then when the housekeeping manager told her to suck it up decided to not do that when someone called for a pickup from the airport about five minute into my lunch she decided to call me and have this wonderful exchange annika we ve got someone at the airport me cool i m on lunch annika so you re not going to get them me no i m on lunch annika huff fine click when i came back from my lunch i discovered that not only had she not gotten the guest who called again to complain about waiting thirty minute for his ride but she also lied to the other morning shift agent about having received a call at all oh and also she wa fired a week later for stealing wine from our sale office getting blazingly drunk on shift and then driving the shuttle fun time
i m from the netherlands and a you can imagine from a culture who hold the go dutch expression we don t allow the server from horeca hotel restaurant cafe s complement their income with tip or they ll starve because of that the salary are ok but many tip however a tab will usually have an average max of tip so i wonder how foreigner in general tip do usually people who work in touristic area have a fixed salary thanks for feeding my curiosity
slow night at the hotel i work at just a room hotel with a generous cancelation policy of pm day of arrival it wa pm and it wa the last check in for the night figured he said he wa going to be in sometime after midnight nope called to cancel without penalty i went through the normal spiel sir unfortunately it after our cancelation policy and i d have to charge you for this reservation it wa only one night his first response wa uhh yea you might want to rethink that instantly right there i will not wave the charge so i stuck with my policy and he tell me that he will just dispute the charge i went civil with my response alright sir i will inform my manager that you are disputing a legal charge for a reservation that you booked yesterday and have yourself a good night i made sure he couldn t say anything else

i manage at a counter service place a reasonably nice cafe within a park customer order and pay and then we bring the food out to them weekend get very busy but there are plenty of staff to manage those shift so today i m walking the floor and get called over by a lady who ha just been served her food a chicken and avocado salad she indicates to her plate and tell me that there is a lot of rocket there now the salad is listed a containing chicken avocado rocket pomegranate and pancetta it s a nice salad i have it a lot myself so i politely point out to the lady that yes the salad is indeed made with rocket i thought she might say that she had read the menu incorrectly but she then told me that she read that it came with rocket but assumed it would be a mixed salad this wa quite hard to respond to because what more can a place do than list the ingredient in a dish she certainly didn t ask while ordering so i tried to explain that a the meal wa exactly a advertised and of good quality and that it came out in a timely manner that unfortunately i would neither refund her meal or swap it for something else but i would take her comment a feedback for a potential menu change in future she then told me i had poor customer service and that i could have at least offered her a new meal at this point i really started to believe she wa entitled a she wa essentially suggesting i should replace her perfectly good meal a well a offer her more so i stuck to my gun and again explained my position at this point she cut me off and took out her phone to start writing what turned out to be a bad review i actually really pride myself on customer service and get a fair amount of praise from my regular i will go the extra mile to help someone find a dish they can eat or fix something that s not quite right but everyone ha to draw a line somewhere i won t start giving free food out to anyone that won t read i do have a business to run just ugh been stewing all evening and trying to shake it off i think the fact that she called me condescending in her review ha really got to me because i did my absolute best to be polite and honest with her edit thanks for the support and some opposing opinion i still stick by how i handled it a i believed it is fair for the venue and the country in which i work i appreciate that at other place it s better to suck it up and give the customer anything they need but they re not the kind of place i want to work
sorry this got so long i m really awful at keeping thing brief i ve been a server for ten year in december with my current company for three a of april i m also the only server who is cross trained a a host and a cook to give you an idea i wa in line for management before i figured out it wasn t worth the pay so i ve seen and dealt with a lot and have learned to just take the table a they come and not sweat whether or not you think a table is gonna tip when they get sat treat them the same get them in get them out the good and bad tip even themselves out today we had a party of twenty people walk in and the host ask me where we should seat them out of habit from my host training i ask would you prefer a table with chair or a few half table half booth we have a party sitting at one we could use so it could be about twenty five to thirty minute before we could seat you there but if you want all chair i have table right here i showed them the table in my section where they could clearly already see them the host of the party asked everyone what they wanted and they said they would prefer to wait a most of them found chair uncomfortable my manager saw the open table in my section saw the party and asked why we were making them wait i told him what they d told me about wanting to wait for booth to be pushed together and he told me no if we have space we tell them where we re putting them and that s where they ll sit this directly conflicted with my guest focused training where you clarify all seating preference with the party before arranging table booth or table dining room or bar need high chair etc you ask every table every time that s how i wa trained eventually the party get sat and people are asking me why they re not in my section even though the host and i both explained that we offered them immediate seating at the table in the front and they wanted the booth in the back they didn t believe that people were willing to wait for preferred seating reminder none of these people have ever done exclusively hosting shift not even the manager so they don t quite get how passionate people can get about a booth seat at a restaurant and claimed that i wanted to pas them off to another server just because they were black yes they actually said this when i unlike other server have never turned down a table or seated out of rotation one of the server who said this claiming afterwards that she wa kidding of course later told me the manager in question agreed with what she d said about me not wanting a large party because they were black i feel like people should know me better than that by now with how long i ve worked there i ve posted about this place before and i ve felt it getting more toxic but i ve never had it directed at me so it wa really upsetting server feel free to say awful thing about guest on the expo line in front of other manager calling them all sort of horrible name and refusing to take table because of ethnicity and management doe nothing about it i wish i didn t need the weekend money a much a i do so i could just get out of there
had some table hopper tonight firstly they did not acknowledge u a the host owner server at all walked passed u time without acknowledging our existence no eye contact no acknowledgment of our greeting they then walked to the only table in our main restaurant which wa not available no serviette or silverware a the table had just been used and not reset there were plenty of other free table here they sat my husband walked towards them with menu and they proceeded to get up and walk right past him he literally had to step aside to let them pas again no acknowledgment of his existence they then walked into our other room which wa set up for a group which had pre reserved and pre ordered and then asked if they could sit in there we explained that i would just have to move a table around for them and they promptly sat on the group table set for we explained that this wa exactly the table which wa reserved eye roll followed there wa a reserved sign on it i moved some furniture around and put their table together they reluctantly moved over to this table they have still not said hello or made any eye contact it wa just weird there are many story like this already i know but we aren t used to being ignored in this way we are a tiny family run place anyone walking in stand directly at the main bar with the reservation book etc you can t miss u
i ve had two experience lately where that happened and it just never make sense to me one wa a few week ago i had a table of two lady and a teenage boy that came in the dead time of the afternoon and ate they were all very nice and seemed very happy with everything one of the woman asked if we were currently hiring and i told them that currently no but i could still give her an application in case something change both woman mentioned multiple time that they used to wait table they didnt leave me a single penny then just the other day a woman and her boyfriend came in and were sat in a different server section i ve known them both for a few year and i actually used to work with the woman she is a waitress at another restaurant in town and honestly she is a really bad server so they waved me over to say hi and chit chat she asked if we were hiring i told her the same thing a the other woman no but i can get you an application in case something change their server is pretty good at her job and it wa slow at the time so i could tell they got excellent service no tip that one really made me mad especially since she ha it stuck in her head that i would give her a recommendation if we were hiring i had her a a friend on facebook and i just deleted her right away after that she of all people should know how much server rely on tip i love my job but some people really suck
to my thinking your birthday is important to you and your loved one it make total sense to treat a friend or family member to a meal or drink to celebrate his or her birthday i can t understand why bar and restaurant are supposedly on the hook to distribute free product what irks me is the expectation that once you announce you re celebrating a birthday it s incumbent on a business to give you thing the announcement that you re celebrating a birthday is just letting your server or bartender know that he or she is now required to respond with an offer of free stuff it s my daughter s birthday do you do anything for birthday asked in that whiney passive aggressive tone i ve seen horrible yelp review that included complaint of absolutely no birthday pampering and we told them it wa my mother s birthday and they did nothing i can t even understand why you expect random stranger to care
i will always remember this wanna be scam artist i wa working corporate guest relation and i received a very long email from a guest about their stay at our resort property in mexico this wa a very nice all inclusive beachfront resort she put a lot of effort into the email which wa basically a day by diary of her night stay listing every possible complaint someone could come up with along with a huge collection of picture a evidence it wa several page long and it looked something like this day the shuttle driver wa rude we had to wait minute to checked in the view is horrible we can t see the ocean the sheet were dirty picture attached the a c is so loud i can t sleep there is a crack in the sidewalk outside our room picture attached my dinner wa cold and there wasn t any salt pepper on the table the shower ha no water pressure day we had breakfast at and they were out of pancake my daughter s favorite cereal wasn t available there were loud child playing in the pool all day there is a light out on the pathway picture attached i called the front desk to ask for more towel and no one answered i think housekeeping took money out of my purse the chair in the lobby are uncomfortable one of the electrical plug in my room doesn t work imagine a list with more thing from her night stay every department from fd housekeeping maintenance ect now some of the complaint seemed plausible but really who spends their entire vacation making a log of everything they think is wrong with a resort especially a hotel we get very little complaint about so i contacted the fom to discus the guest assuming the fd system which i cannot access would have all the log from this woman s complaint the hotel log everything but there wa nothing there in fact the entire time she wa at the hotel she never voiced any complaint she merely logged them in her little complaint diary and went about her business many of her issue were extremely petty for example the crack in the sidewalk wa about inch long and wa flat on both side it wasn t a tripping hazard just a small crack the light out in the path even in the picture i could see that the area wa still very well lit because they have light everywhere in that area her room didn t have an ocean view because she booked a courtyard view the picture of dirty sheet showed one tiny little black spot in the corner like if you tapped the sheet with the tip of a pen or fine marker it took minute to check in because she showed up hour early and they had to get a room ready the shower in her room wa fine and the a c unit wa not loud at all we looked into everything talked to all of the department head and had the room she stayed in fully inspected while the list made it seem like she had a horrible stay there really wasn t any substance behind her complaint so since this all seemed a bit fishy to everyone i called the guest and spoke with her about her complaint i told her that i had been in contact with the hotel and we couldn t find any record of her complaint and i inquired who at the hotel she had spoken with while she wa there and she admitted no one i gave her my apology and suggested that next time she should express her complaint while on property so they can be immediately addressed for example housekeeping would have been happy to change out the dirty sheet etc etc keep in mind she wa there for night at an all inclusive resort with different restaurant bar multiple pool etc she probably never left the hotel but never said a word about all the problem she wa having note of the employee speak english it s a requirement because this is an american hotel chain so in the name of customer service i tell her that we would like an opportunity to make this right and offered her free night to come back in the future nope that s not good enough she want a full refund and nothing le i told her that i would discus and get back to her the next day i inform her that the hotel would not offer a refund but they were willing to add in another night so now that s free night nope unacceptable she continues to demand a full refund we went back and forth she wanted my manager who then told her the same thing the guest hung up on my bos after thing got a bit heated a few day later she call again and want to know the status of her refund ummmm how do you give someone a status on something that s never going to happen she say she s going to contact corporate i roll my eye and explain to her again that i am the corporate guest relation coordinator i am corporate i spent forever on the phone talking with this woman who just refused to accept the free night and wa hell bent on getting her money back she just kept going back to her list well what about what are you going to about i wouldn t budge it is free future night or nothing lady then the unimaginable happened in all my year of customer service i have never ever had a scammer resort to telling the truth when she finally realized she wasn t getting a refund she cried i can t afford to pay for this i don t have the money i don t know what to do you have to help me i wa like you can t afford to pay weren t you planning on paying for your stay when you made the reservation it s not like we are charging you more than you agreed to and we are still offering you free night for your next visit she responded completely broken and weeping i didn t think i would have to pay i thought i would get my money back i don t know what i m going to do please you have to help me i can t pay for this i ve got kid please you ve got to do something to help me out i need you to give me a refund i don t know what i m going to do if i can t get that money back i can t pay for this did this woman just admit she planned all this thinking she wa just going to complain her way into a refund yes yes she did just say that me ma am i m sorry but there is nothing i can do guest who now sound like she is having a panic attack i ve got to get that money back i ve got to do something you ve got to help me out here i don t know what else to do i don t have the money i can t pay for this me ma am you should have thought about that before you went on a vacation you couldn t afford yea i shouldn t have said this but i wa just done with this woman she had wasted enough of my time already not to mention all the people at the hotel who looked into her entire list of bullshit she cried some more then she resorted to screaming so i hung up on her everything wa noted all my call are recorded so i went ahead and attached that file she did send some hate mail to our corporate office but due to the fact that i had a recording of her admitting she wa trying to scam u they ignored her letter oh and her frequent guest membership wa flagged a being banned from all property we did not send her the free night certificate either
this wa a few day ago during my overnight shift a male guest who had been friendly and joking with me at the desk earlier in my shift a he wa getting another copy of his room key made a reappearance looking a little embarrassed oh hey you re back what can i help you with i say with a smile oh um is there an emt or first aid station i could walk to here hmm no unfortunately what happens is i call security dispatch and they radio the emts to go to a specific location do you want me to call them for you well it s not an emergency i just this is embarrassing but i can t stop farting and this is so weird and nothing like this ha ever happened to me before and i m about to go to bed but i m worried what s going to happen when i go to sleep he pause significantly there like he s worried about maybe pooping the bed but me being the better safe than sorry night shift worker is picturing an episode of house or autopsy confession of a medical examiner where this is the first sign before this guy dy i don t really think that s the case just like i don t really think this woman with the same last name a you isn t really your wife okay to enter the room but since you didn t put her name on the room my mind is keen to remind me she could easily be an assassin or murderous soon to be ex wife and thus will act with caution let me call security and see if they are willing to just maybe connect the phone to the emts office and potentially get your question answered i say and with his agreement i make the call when dispatch pick up this is what i say hello this is me from hotel front desk this isn t an emergency but i have a guest with some abdominal digestive discomfort and would like to ask an emt about it before i can continue security is very agreeable to just sending them over so i didn t get much chance to ask about a phone call i direct the guest to a bench in the lobby to wait and a few minute later emts come out to ask him what s wrong and do an eval and answer his question i went back to my work and later saw him looking relieved a he headed back to his room assumably with his answer a i m typing this though i realize i prob should have warned him that when emts show up they show up in a pair one pushing a wheelchair holding gear a security officer and a security supervisor hope he wasn t too embarrassed about it it s just policy and i ve called emts for the simplest scratch with this response i suspect this seemingly over reaction is management own way of better safe than sorry or sued at least he got his question answered and my lobby wa super empty at am minus the small group discussing this guest uncontrollable gas
some background i work morning at a cute little historic boutique hotel most day we have two different building both of which offer room with a mountain view one of our building ha some corner room that are featured a premium king room a opposed to standard king because they are slightly larger and quieter one in particular is our most requested room in the whole hotel it is the only premium king on the highest floor that is facing the mountain and ha the best view of them in the whole hotel i have never once received a complaint about this room until this day and most people booking premium king will request this room number specifically the only downside of these room is that in the summer the air flow to them especially on the fourth highest floor is not very good because they are situated in the corner with large window so they can get pretty hot this past summer without any communication to the fd about it naturally the maintenance team chose to combat this by installing portable air conditioner in each corner room with one tube going across a small section of the floor and piece of plywood to hold the wire going outside the building in place to supply them with power one day i checked a middle aged woman a true karen and her husband into our most requested corner room on the fourth floor with a mountain view fast forward minute and i get a call from karen s husband who note that there is a machine in the room news to the fd that doesn t appear to be working i tell him i can send maintenance to take a look and tell me that s alright and hang up soon after i get a call from karen which go something like this karen there s a strange machine that doesn t seem to be working in our room with tube and wire that we can trip over all over the room and random piece of plywood on our wall me never heard of anything like this in those room that sound to me like some sort of air conditioner those corner room can get pretty warm in the summer perhaps maintenance ha installed them to cool them down i am not sure but i can send someone from maintenance to take a look or i can move you to a room not situated in a corner karen no i don t think you re understanding me not only is this contraption in our way but it isn t working and there is a hole in the plywood letting in air me i m sorry to hear that is inconveniencing you again i can send maintenance or i can offer you a different room not situated in a corner karen you clearly aren t understanding me hang up i think that s end and they are living with the situation and spoiler i am wrong ten minute pas and i am approached by karen herself my manager is in the back and me and one other employee are at the desk she come up to me and start her spiel karen i am in nice room and i called earlier about the plywood and the machine attached to it me ahh yes have you decided if you would like to move room or have maintenance take a look karen no you are not understanding me at all because this is something that need to be fixed right now i took picture here is the plywood and there is a little hole there you see it zoomz in on the hole in the plywood there is literally air from the outside coming inside our room can you see that there is literally outside coming inside i don t know how many time she repeated that exact phrase but me and my colleague just stared at her in astonishment me okay ma a karen cut me off it is most certainly not okay the outside is coming inside our room and you need to do something about it right now i repeat my offer to send up maintenance or move her to a different room karen i work in customer service and this is not customer service you aren t even listening to me how can you not understand what i m saying at this point i don t get paid enough to deal with this me ma am i am understanding you fine and i have offered my solution may i grab my manager for you karen no you may not i am speaking with you and you need to fix this i repeat my offer to send maintenance or move her she repeat herself refuse a manager and show me a picture again telling me this is worst customer service she ha ever received i am flabbergasted what doe this person want from me i have only two solution for her and she is refusing to speak to a manager which is unheard of in karen world at that point i stop talking with her excuse myself and retrieve my manager who move her to a different room and offer her breakfast voucher for the inconvenience she demand a lower room rate a well he obliges we can all see what she wa hoping to get out of me now free stuff of course and she proceeds to tell him i should be fired for the poor customer service i provided to which he ignored her and told me i could go take a minute in the back if i needed since she wa so rude to this day i am floored by this grand miscommunication but i do see the scheme she wa trying to pull in getting a lower room rate which can t be done without manager approval hence the conflict i also still giggle to myself about this karen s fear of the outside and sometimes wonder if that woman really just needed more of it
had a british couple come in last night very polite and chatty ordered drink and an app before their entree and mentioned offhandedly that this wa their first time eating with u a major italian chain known for unlimited breadstick every time i dropped something off at their table or went back to check on them they loved it oh that look lovely this taste amazing i couldn t eat another bite but we ll be back people dunk on my restaurant a lot for being a mediocre watered down imitation of italian fine dining deservedly so tbh but it made me smile to find that people trying it for the first time thought it wa so good
mobile btw so to start i offered to work a double for my bos since we had nobody scheduled for the pm shift today i thought it wa gonna be me and bos man since we have had every other senior front desk agent leave or put their week in we are down to senior front desk agent one of which is our full time auditor and a bunch of new hire maybe i do day of second shift and day of night audit for reference and aside from my other auditor who is newer than me i m the only one capable of doing audit my manager don t know how anyway i came in at pm instead of pm after my manager asked what time i wanted to come in he even said pm if i wanted well fuck my life because that wa the worst time a soon a i got in i wasn t able to count my till or do anything i went straight to checking people in and answering their question on top of phone call for maybe hour mind you arrival to make our room hotel fully booked at shoutout to our understaffed housekeeping team for having every room ready by check in pm you da be no hype to construction because we can t move people around it when we are sold out i also thankfully had a new hire working the additional pod since we have up here and he wa called in to help assist but it didn t help at the same time because i had to stop mid check in or whatever to help answer his question or calm a guest down after he angered them moving past the huge rush of people and phone call it did calm down but we also serve an evening reception every single day from pm and that s when it started up again the whole lobby wa packed i haven t seen it like that since summer guest hammering the dispenser for utensil and making them spill out onto the floor using their bare hand instead of the provided utensil to grab chip since we had nacho tonight the whole yard thankfully my manager wa still around to help smooth that out but then all hell broke loose we need more coffee tea and sugar hot water and on top of all those request i did have my houseman but he wa busy getting more towel for the pool and cleaning if i wasn t sending him up to room for request we had guest come and complain about the pool burning their eye and them coughing yes because there wa maybe of you in there and you weren t showering before hopping in so the chemical reaction got all stirred up and blah blah at least that s what my manager said i also asked about the level and he said he asked our pool guy who said they were good okay so a parent complained saying it wa toxic and could be a lawsuit yadda i told him i would contact my manager but apparently me returning to my pod wasn t good or fast enough so he asked again if i wa going to contact him and do something about it yes give me a minute i have many thing to do i even had another guest repeat the same thing after i did text my manager like yes you aren t the first one to tell me and be an asshole about it so i make pool closed sign and sent my little new hire off to put them on the door even against my manager advice because i didn t want more people to be affected since i wa unaware until after that if it wa toxic or not after making everyone leave and letting it calm down for about an hour and being asked over and over when it would open or why it wa closed i reopened it and allowed kid to stay until pm even though it s meant to close for kid at pm due to the issue cue the typical i booked here specifically for the pool card that made them happy after at least but wait there s more our back elevator broke down and wasn t working my houseman tried to fix it to no avail i called our maintenance man who tried to explain to our houseman who didn t get it a bit of a language barrier and our maintenance man after that said to just leave it be for now my houseman didn t like that and asked if i could call a technician out i obliged and had them send an overtime technician out to fix it and he did in about an hour or so but no complaint thankfully yeah that might cost the hotel some and wasn t approved by a manager but i do audit i see all the number they can afford it plus better done now than monday or tuesday when my manager are back in to wrap it up it ha been a long day i did so much i am exhausted i ve been here month and never worked so hard but i loved it i loved being so busy and assisting so many people the amount of happy people outweighs the nasty entitled one i have about hour left of this double and so far the am shift ha been a breeze let s hope it stay this way back at pm tonight d

heyla guy i hope everyone is having a good saturday so far now this actually happened last night and i am finally mentally calm enough to put keyboard to webpage without wanting to rip fax to piece sending said equipment flying across our lobby a i have mentioned once or twice before third party site have been known to send our hotel property reservation information without actually putting it in our system which leaf u fda to do it manually via fax it fine if we can catch it fast enough but on busy night where we don t always hear the fax machine go off so we have had missed a paper or two until the guest actually come in and let u know they have a reservation now a most of you may know some of the third party don t give a hoot about the actual staff going mental example being last night last weekend of the stockshow and we sold out fairly quickly well before pm some reservation come by phone by website and a few popped up by fax and they just kept coming even when my system said no vacancy the fax with pre paid last minute reservation came in for room i did not have i had to explain to several people last night and feeling horrid while doing so that whoever they got the room from had sold them something that did not exist i would be willing to vouch for a refund but they would have to call them to get it processed even while i wa doing this and shuffling my normal chore the fax kept coming it finally got to the point where one of the agent with the rd called the front desk to verify that i could not get a room for one of these guest when i mentioned that i had no room and they forced it through they had the ball to actually say well your hotel is going to be charged a relocation fee of xxx dollar if you cannot accommodate this guest you don t have an upgraded room you can move them to guy i exploded in the softest way possible my customer service mask dropped and i had to squeeze the phone to keep from swearing worse then a sailor at these people i told them point blank i have no room your system is showing incorrect information you keep pushing through room even though i had told several of your colleague i have nothing you are charging these people for something i don t have you relocate them but we should not be charged for this my auditor who came in that evening could see the steam pouring out of my ear bless him he bounced behind the desk and helped me with a few more of the guest that came in before i sat down in the back to cool down argh

i don t know why but it seems like the craziest thing tend to happen on thursday night to make matter worse my security guy doesn t work most thursday for some reason thankfully i can generally handle crazy by myself but last night wa something else early on in the evening a new reservation showed up in my arrival a little while later a girl walked in to check in along with whom i would assume wa her boyfriend i get her credit card information check her in and it seemed to be going how it should until after i hand her her keycard guest can you escort me to my room i wa a little bit flustered by the request but i still kept my customer service smile me unfortunately i m not allowed to leave the front desk sorry about that it wa an odd request nobody ha asked me that before heck our room are ridiculously easy to find too just keep on walking down the hall until you find it no turn with room one way and the other way still i thought nothing of it and just continued on with my night the girl and her boyfriend left for a little bit and then came back i just did what i usually did watched youtube looked at stuff on reddit and occasionally patrolled the first floor of the hotel since my security guy wasn t there then the lady and her boyfriend showed up again she walked up to the front desk and asked for another keycard since she accidentally left hers back in her room i thought no biggie and assured her that it happened all the time then i gave her the card expecting her and her boytoy to leave but she didn t she argued with her boyfriend a bit telling him to just go get his stuff out of the car saying it wa unlocked this happened several time she then started talking to somebody on the phone until she started arguing with them while wandering the lobby slowly getting louder to the point where i wa tempted to tell her to quiet down i wa actually getting pretty annoyed at that point boyfriend wa just kind of following her around while she argued with whoever it wa on the phone then she did something so unexpected so stupid and so aggravating i wa just gobsmacked that anybody would even consider such a thing while by the sundry shop she out of nowhere just knocked off the metal lid for the trash can over there sending it flying across the floor toward the front desk i wa in shock but i wa also angry so i picked up the lid cutting my thumb in the process and try to put it back together and put it back on the trash can while i did so i told the girl off i wa absolutely ticked me you need to leave right now guest but i have a room here me i know but you need to at least leave the lobby you can t just throw stuff around finally the girl and her quiet boyfriend walked down the hall i glanced over there after washing the blood off my thumb and saw what wa going on the girl and her boyfriend were by the vending machine and the lady had the gall to have knocked down a couple of plant that were low to the ground across from it at that i started walking toward them and a soon a they saw me coming they scurried out the side door thankfully nothing wa broken so i just put the two small plant back in their holder back careful to wipe off any blood i also went over and finally found a band aid to cover up my bleeding thumb i would have done so earlier but i wa so angry and trying to keep an eye on those annoying guest well the girl wa annoying at least i checked outside and they were arguing with another guest from their car i don t know how somebody could be so belligerent the other guest came in and the car drove off he assured me that they were gone thankfully just to make sure i performed the petty task of deactivating the girl s keycard i wa also prepared to tell the girl that they were not allowed back into the hotel after her little stunt after that i am happy to say i never heard anything from them i didn t check them out or anything and judging from the log apparently they were checked out shortly after i clocked out which make me wonder if the girl who came in after me just went ahead and checked them out the only other thing i heard about them though wa from a long term stay who remarked that he heard her arguing on the phone outside and that apparently she wa hitting herself it didn t make much sense but not much about my interaction with her did for instance back at the beginning she asked me to escort her to her room why did she plan on somebody sneaking behind my desk and robbing it or something not to mention the random act of violence against inanimate object while arguing on the phone wa something that made absolutely no sense hopefully i never see that girl again according to her reservation she lived on the other side of the country i hope she went back there and stayed there tl dr guest turn out to be crazy knock trash can lid across the lobby while arguing on phone i scare them off
i work a night audit for a mediocre hotel chain we are right off the interstate along with two other hotel every year our hotel and the hotel across the street from u night out sell out entirely to the local military institute the hotel on the hill behind u let s call it joho s only sell some of their room because they find the cadet to be too rowdy for them well this time of year they have their winter formal this all happened on valentine s weekend because there are so many cadet they let the upperclassmen have theirs on friday and then the lowerclassman had theirs on saturday friday went okay other than a cadet had to be taken back to barrack after getting seriously ill so the colonel jokingly said not to wake him up at am the next night so of course all hell broke loose at am on saturday it s my first winter formal with them so i wa not prepared at all suddenly the two security officer sitting watching the camera check their phone and rush out the door i asked if something happened at one of the other hotel and they said yes shortly after a deputy and the colonel from across the street pull up out front and a cadet come jogging over from our back parking lot they talk and then the cadet come in and asks to sit in the breakfast area until the deputy come back the deputy and colonel leave and then the colonel come back five minute later he come in and start questioning the cadet what i eavesdropped from that the cadet s girlfriend wa on the balcony when she saw a car drive over the side of the parking lot and crash on the hill of the joho s behind u so her boyfriend call and the colonel before running across the street to help the car it wa another blindingly drunk underage cadet who we will call john he help john get out of the car john rip his own shirt off and go running down to the road the cadet barely stop him from getting squished by a truck john run off into the wood starting the search currently going on it s at this point that i hear footstep on the roof of the lobby a loud bang then nothing i look out the window but see nothing but i say something to the colonel anyways so he run outside run back in and get the first cadet john had jumped from the roof he wa okay the roof he jumped from thankfully wa just over a story high and he landed in bush which is why i couldn t see him just our lobby roof and not the four story it could have been he wa not trying to kill himself but trying to get away because he knew he wa in trouble the emt s come out of the wood to help him his face and knee are busted and he s on the brink of being hypothermic so i run and get a blanket while they bring him into the lobby i called my bos because i have no access to the camera the state police get involved because he wa drinking and driving and last we heard john wa kicked from the institute the thing that bother me is that the school rent out the hotel for these kid to drink knowing half of them aren t old enough to drink they make them check in before security come and then they won t let them leave their room so they have plausible deniability and can say they must have brought the alcohol before security got there because the student pay for the room the school doesn t have to monitor what happens inside these kid have been in such a strict environment that when they get an inch of freedom they take five mile tl dr military university freshman get drunk and crash his car while running from cop jump off a one story roof and can t run anymore

guy with a reservation come in we ll call him ag angry guy ag hey i have a reservation under ag m just a moment m okay can i have a card and your id ag nod hand it over and we begin card doesn t have a chip that s because the card isn t a proper card it s a prepaid one i m not even sure if you can use a prepaid visa to pay for the room i d assume not but didn t question it i ran it it declined he hand me another card it also decline he proclaims the reader must be broken because it always work i say nothing fully knowing it doe work i ve never had an issue using the thing but he pull out his own card and hand it to me of course it looked like it wa tossed to a pack of starving wolf it also ha no chip but i run it anyways it also decline ag i don t understand it s worked before i have on that card this is where i run into that issue the issue of the room being m sir the room is ag launch into a tirade about how the room wa supposed to be how he s insulted by the ludicrous price but nothing is changing the pc mind on the pricing this is where he offer to pay with cash i ve been duped like this before i ve lived this before i m not budging i refuse citing policy he look at me baffled ag so you re saying i can t give you up front you can t take this money and tell your bos hey the dude gave me the money but didn t have a card to use i shake my head also thinking that doesn t even cover the incidental and tax it s still not enough m sorry sir but if i did that i could very well lose my job i have been instructed not to do this i m sorry ag not deterred by the idea that i could lose my fucking job cry out ag you want me to go back out there i stayed at brand hotel in city mile and mile away and it s always worked there ah yes the trope of it s always worked in other place despite the fact that we have wildly different policy and the fact that it possibly working there flawlessly doesn t excuse the fact that i literally cannot bill the card i tell him that other location may have different policy but i cannot violate the one at this location this guy glare at me like a if i killed everything he ever cared for in the worst way possible before breaking the glare and typing furiously at his phone i think he s trying to text his bos to get approval i ve already decided i m still not accepting it a i don t have cc auth on file so he could call anyone even if it s not the person who owns the card if there isn t a card physically placed in my hand i am not accepting it he gather his thing muttering about how bullshit everything is how were price gouging him and finally leaf say that if he come back he ll only have that base and not enough to cover the room which is about lmfao
name changed to protect the innocent and guilty alike in this part we break away from soap opera drama and get to kaitlyn her lie and new year s resolution kaitlyn is notoriously anti confrontational if she can lie to avoid backlash from a poor decision she ll throw whoever she can under the bus most often howard her husband and co owner of this establishment howard is an easygoing guy fairly lax a long a business get done guest are happy we re presentable and can score well on inspection which front desk doe very well both in inspection and guest review he s also gone a lot managing other property and venture he s invested in so kaitlyn rule in absentia making decree in his name the main issue here to me is the deceit she tell three different worker three different reason she want something to change for example she s trying to enforce that no one park under the wide balcony at the front the furthest portion a favorite spot for rainy freezing or late night setting telling kelsey howard demanded it matilda that there wa a traffic accident and sharon that corporate demand the space be available for special club member there s multiple others she s developed a checklist of cleaning that must be completed every shift beyond what we ve all ready been doing cleaning toilet vacuuming polishing counter to name a few this is to be done every single shift a little overkill and it s not like there s no one besides the other night auditor that s a different rant there cleaning if something need done we all do it then there s the television she ha claimed it must be on the news am to am then pm to pm guess what time she s usually at the front desk there s a fire stick attached to the tv by kelsey a god send for night audit loaded with streaming option howard from the very beginning simply requested no one watch anything too explicit which ha been followed by everyone but me because it s am and dammit i wanna watch some true detective kaitlyn hasn t announced it publicly yet but she ha intention of getting rid of it entirely how can we know that a well a her lie about the origin of these decision her good buddy ophelia of part fame is a notorious gossip and let slip her vision of how the new year is going to be now to a point she ha the right to do some of this stuff if she want the news on she can turn it on she want the alcove fully available for guest coming and going she should say so it s just the way she s going about it lying so badly unable to keep her story straight for a single day that crawl up my skin i don t deal with either deceit or passive aggression very well and those basically make up kaitlyn s modus operandi i hope im not coming across a entitled or lazy or something this portion is le troublesome to me than part or though this part doe contribute to the resentment and overall aggravation going on all over this property and i tend to feel that the laid back atmosphere of this place is one of the only true incentive that keep her with a front desk team that regularly exceeds inspection score and is the most positive aspect in guest review they do not pay competitively bend over backwards to keep every worker under hour to avoid benefit and to simultaneously expect more while undoing what small pleasure keep u overlooking these misgiving it just feel like she s shooting the business in the foot but not a bad a in part
it s the beginning of out dinner rush valentine s day dinner rush and i m a food runner for the night day of my server training a ticket come out for steak medium sirloin a medium well fillet and a rare ribeye i run out the medium the medium well drop them off and come right back with the rare i ask them to check their steak cut into them to make sure they re cooked right and if they need anything before i head back three of them say they re fine that their steak are fine and that they re happy but the father is visibly upset i ask him if there wa anything i could help him with and he responds by saying that his steak wa cooked too much i take a look at the cut and see a pretty definitive red through it all oh well i apologize to him and let him know that we ll have another steak out soon i get back to the kitchen and tell the assistant manager who s running the window for the night that he want a blue rare he sends the steak back tell the kitchen and writes a re cook slip not long after the new steak come out and he ha a kitchen manager run the steak this time she come back bloody steak and plate in hand and tell the am that the steak is still too cooked and that he said he litterally just want a steak cooked for second on each side although questionnable the am decides to have the kitchen do just that he get the new steak out in under a minute and run it himself this time i m interested in how it ll turn out so i pretend to be following him with a ticket and watch the delivery the father cut into it right away take a second to look at it and smile at the am everyone at the table is good the father ha his steak and we ve got a new inside joke to use around the restaraunt it freaked me out whenever an ambulance wa parked in front of our restaraunt a little later though
when i say early close i mean that it is the time that the owner decides that it is okay to shut down before our regular close time i don t mind since most of the closing sidework is done anyways and the kitchen will probably get out early a it is however i am always apprehensive that this kind of table will set up camp and keep myself and my closing server here well past regular closing the worst time that i can think of this happening wa new year s eve no early closing then of course and we closed at our normal hour since we have a bar on the third floor that people can migrate to for the real festivity after dinner a table came in about minute to close so i took the last table myself because i have had piss poor manager in the past that were just looking to clock out and go party and trust me i wanted to party it wa nye baby i wa expecting to be able to serve them have them go on up and then change into fun time clothes unfortunately they stuck around until fortunately my gm had no problem with me leaving a soon a their check wa paid because a it turn out the person that sat at that table wa a former employee at what point do you lose the fact that you were once a server and begin to take over people s time in such a way
i work a a server and i get the most entitled selfish people you can ever deal with i ve had multiple occasion where the customer pull some sort of play to make it more beneficial for them money wise for example i get these table all the time they order over worth of food get off multiple time because they are reward member dropping the bill to around then they decide to use gift card which take an even bigger chunk out of the total by the time they are done with their coupon their bill is going onto their card and what do you know i get a tip on the not the original bill people need to learn that this is how we live we don t live off our hourly tip are how we pay for all the necessity of life kid parent need to teach their kid how to tip if given good service i ve never had a young adult age leave a tip anywhere close to they come in make a mess and leave a tip that make me say well fuck and making me want to run out to them and say here take your cent back that you left me on your bill i can t wait till they get a serving job and get put into the same situation they have put many other server in let me speak with manager karen do i have to say anymore
god i hate monday obligatory i m on mobile yada yada i am usually the mod on monday because my gm ha to do inventory and all the special thing gm get to do i wa actually serving today yay and it wa all going pretty well until about pm today top roll in thank god it s not busy and we can accommodate my gm had just sent herself home because she had the flu and just after that top roll in i am now the mod thankfully i also have more server and a bartender to take over the top so i can handle someone up front who need to see a manager y all this bald headed witch can t decipher between a pending transaction and a posted transaction on her online banking she think that we charged her twice for an online order that wa charged to her acct at like pm last night we don t hold card on file the food got comped because it sucked she s demanding that her bank is special and comp come fast than other bank and oh sometimes they post thing on saturday she also casually said that she won t be eating here again lol ok like seriously girl i m so glad this day is over i m sorry about the pathetic rant but i needed to let it out
i never questioned guest wanting booth it s an inconvenience for rotation but other than that i didn t give it a second thought then my coworker brought up some good point guest can t possibly have booth everywhere in their home so why are they suddenly incapable of eating at a table bus and train don t have booth so if you can t sit anywhere but a booth where do you sit fine dining restaurant mostly consist of table not booth so it s not like a dinner experience would be ruined without a booth you literally get the same service either way sometimes all you re doing is messing up rotation and adding time to your wait so i end this off with why are booth so important to guest
i m not even mad about this one though they did lie about one part of their complaint which bug me but the rest is golden last night a couple come down visibly intoxicated one way to tell that someone is pretty drunk is when they keep insisting that they aren t that drunk they complain that their tv keep turning on randomly then turning off also the hallway light keep turning on and off a well now i joke with guest all the time so i make a crack that oh man it s gotta be a ghost they laugh we laugh though they do seem to take what i said a little too seriously and ask if anyone died in there and suggest some furniture moved around so i need to reassure them that no no one died in that room the poor kid that i m training is behind me he s a bit socially awkward we re just putting him in na to be a body just ha a look on his face like wtf is going on so anyway i pulled out the notepad take down the note of the issue right in front of them so they see i m writing these thing down i mention it might be an electrical issue in the room since they just did some renovation and asked them if they felt comfortable staying in the room for the night my mistake i guess i should have outright said would you like me to move you for the night they verbally confirmed they were fine staying in the room for the night then left i come in for my shift at pm and i m told by my manager and the morning fda that the couple came down all pissed that we had made them feel like asshole because we were joking about ghost didn t take them seriously didn t offer to move them and the guy had trouble sleeping because the whole night he wa wondering if there wa a ghost in the room just want to make a note here that my gm wa not mad with me about the complaint she know and trust me and assumed it wa just drunk people misinterpreting event she just wanted to know my side after i told her what happened both her and the morning fda laughed and just suggested that i not make ghost joke anymore and that i clearly spell out offer to move people since guest don t have the best listening skill especially after a beer or i ve been stockpiling a few story over the past few week but i had to get this one out sooner rather than later
don t know if this happen to you guy often but it really annoys me when i ask if the customer is ready to order they say yes then go uhhhhhhhhh for the next minute also hate it when they order more stuff after their initial order or adjust their order after i already brought it back to the kitchen fuck why can t you be decisive

so it s my monday we are going to be sold out this weekend with various college sport and a local event we are under a winter weather advisory this weekend and there s a good chance thing are going to suck when i ended my weekend on monday morning we were oversold by room for friday i come in tonight and we now have to sell yay a i m locking the entry way a cop car show up and dude get out of course that s a red flag but whatever i ll see where this go st guy asks about the cheapest room i can offer every other word out of his mouth is fuckin so i raise the rate and give him the price he agrees so i ask for id amp cc now the story start he got mugged and they stole all of his stuff he tell me that s why he brought the other dude with him because he ha an id um ok mugging are not really a thing here but sure that s what happened nd dude give me his id of course he s a local and the st give me a netspend card i already know how this will turn out but i continue to humor them card decline i inform the dude that it s declined and he say my favorite phrase well yeah there s no money on it i don t understand this mindset of why people think that it work that way so i apologize and tell him i cannot check him in with a declined card dude seems to get what i m saying but this just piss off dude he pull out a piece of paper with a card number on it and tell me to run that one i m over it at this point and tell him that i cannot do that he try to argue with me while trying to type the number into the machine of course customer facing machine do not work that way and i inform him a such and that without a physical card i cannot possibly accept this number he finally flip his shit demanding to know why so i start from the beginning you don t have an id the credit card need to be in the name of the registered guest no where in their right mind will take a card number that is written on a piece of paper this whole thing ha felt shady since you walked in the door he tell me i m lying and that you can absolutely type in a number on the customer key pad and that i just must not know how to do it then he said those magic word call your manager now i love it when they tell me that because that s when we re done talking i wa flat out yeah no i m the one here so i m the one in charge i will not be calling my manager for something that make no sense for u to do in the first place at this point you cannot provide me with an id or a credit card so there is nothing left for u to discus he stomped off to try his luck at the no tell motel next door i don t have a lot of faith in that place but even they re not stupid enough to run a credit card number that s written on a piece of scrap paper
so i ve been in food and beverage for most of my life on rare occasion i ve seen maybe or server get into an altercation with customer ever yesterday i had a table come in and everything started out fine they came in during the lunch rush i got them taken care of in a timely fashion and everything seemed fine i cleared all their plate except for that they were picking off of they ended up sitting there with the plate for a long time i asked a few time if they were still eating and everytime they said yes so i left them alone trying not to bother them i got busy taking care of other table and started cashing out table table that got there before them i wa walking back to the kitchen when a guy from this table come up to me with his credit card in hand he look at me and say hey buddy you ever done this before so i asked him have i ever done what before you ever waited table before which really rubbed me the wrong way so i asked him if he wa ready to cash out and took his card even though we were slammed i got him cashed out quick and told them to have a nice day i went to go talk to another table and get their order and while i m standing there at this other table this asshole come up to me and start staring me down he wa close enough to where i could almost feel him breathing down my neck i looked at my table and apologized and told them to give me a second i turned to the asshole and asked him if there wa something else i could help him with he shoved his card in my face and said yeah little pro tip for you try not to hand people their card back with fucking grease on it apparently i had a little grease on my finger which i didn t even notice while i wa running around this guy wa in my face and being a grade a dick i wa busy and didn t have time to deal with his nonsense so i said sir please leave and walked away because i had order to put in and other thing to do a you can imagine that didn t go over very well he started yelling where s your manager i need to speak to a manager both of which were behind the bar so i said either of them can help you and started putting in my order on the computer while i m standing there he keep asking me where the manager is who are still in the same place about ft away i point them out again while he s waiting he s standing there tying to get a rise out of me and start talking shit he asks me so do you like working here yes well too bad because you re out buddy so after that i just ignored him until a manager came over he tell them what happened and finally he leaf i go back to the table i wa talking to when he confronted me and apologized for the scene they told me they were ready to step in because they though he wa about to start swinging my manager saw everything go down and agreed he wa just an asshole but all day i wa thinking why please don t try to start fight with your server

so i served a table of and i immediately recognized one of the girl a someone i knew a a teenager we were on a sport team together and she wa very shy something about her really annoyed me and i wa very cruel to her i made fun of her with our other teammate and she wa a bit isolated from everyone for a while and i think it definitely had something to do with the way i wa with her it wa a very bad time in my life and i took my anger out on people around me and she wa an easy target i really am disgusted with my behaviour back then and i feel so horrible about it i haven t thought about that time in my life at all since then because i ended up developing ptsd from the trauma i experienced at that time so i have blocked a lot of those memory out her mom paid the bill for the table and tipped me nothing on i feel like i got what i deserved and if she had tipped me i think i would have felt shitty about it my friend said maybe i should reach out to her and tell her i m sorry but i don t think that s necessarily the thing to do i ve had someone reach out to me that treated me poorly in high school and it really didn t make me feel any better about the situation it also just seemed like she wa doing it to feel better about herself and i don t want to come across like that there s also a small chance her mom is just the type of person to not tip everything with their meal wa good and they were all very nice to me and thanked me a lot but the guilt ridden anxiety side of me feel it wa definitely personal ugh this ha been really bothering me i feel so guilty

so because it wa somehow possible to get confused no i am not referring to of a cent it wa a mistake surprisingly i can make those people seriously think we charge down to le than a cent a currency that doesn t even exist apparently after reading this whole post people were still confused i can t change the title but to keep from freaking people out i have changed every error in post what the hell a an omen to tonight s shift i sold a kid a bag of chip he tried to purchase a different snack and complained that it s cent higher than what he initially bought it for i tell him that i typed in the product and that s what the price is he put it back and buy a different snack which he pay for before leaving not even minute later i get a call the guy who wa the guardian of the kid call down to complain about the same issue he claim that he wa sold the same product for the price that the kid told me he bought it for i tell him that i am looking at the program and it s not confirming his claim i reconcile by telling him that the employee likely made a mistake and categorized the snack i sold the boy with the initial one the man sent the boy down to buy being vague because you never know who may be reading lol he demand to know if i m calling him a liar i never even said a word what rhyme with liar i tell him that i don t know the fact of the situation a i wasn t on shift and came out towards the tail end of the conversation where i didn t hear anything of note he tell me he s coming to settle this in person i await his presence where he storm into the shop and grab the candy that i already had and yes made sure that the snack the boy and man were referring to were the same a the one i wa talking about they were the same and they were still i literally point to the screen where it say the man then asks to speak with a manager and i tell him that there is no manager on shift he demand to know who the manager is and i write the name on a piece of paper and he storm off all of this for cent i even told him that i wouldn t make him pay the extra change because it s honestly not even worth it this whole fucking thing wasn t worth it cent guest get offended over the weirdest shit
so i just got a phone call from the deli across the road from the hotel i work at to preface the hotel i work at is located right downtown facing the busiest street in the city me me deli guy dg me thank you for calling such amp such this is at your service dg hey is this the such amp such hotel on main st me yes it is how can i be of service today dg i m just calling from the local deli across the road from you guy i just thought you d want to know that in the top floor far right window there s a guy with the drape wide open facing the street stark naked and masturbating so i uh i thought you d want to know if i can see it everyone on the street can see it i tried to contain my laughter but the deli guy wa cracking up quite a bit too i ve never had an issue like this i really wasn t sure what to do so i didn t do anything and just let the guy uhh finish up i guess out of curiosity i did of course look at who wa staying in that particular room turn out it wa older man who ha been staying here the past week or so with his elderly mother a she is seeking cancer treatment from the hospital up the road from u yikes
i ve posted a few story on here before and just some background on myself i work in a rather large almost luxury level hotel in a major city s industrial park area so my hotel tends to be sold out during the weekday and nearly empty on the weekend so of course our rate drop massively for the rd party booking site however for this one particular friday night that wasn t really the case we were actually pretty close to half full and it wa all due to this one massive group that wa staying with u we had almost all of our ballroom and meeting room booked up for this one group i won t go into detail on who they are but these people are near secret society level with how many pocket they have their hand in they are an old school organization with big money so my manager and the sale team really wanted this entire night to be perfect for them you can guess from the title that the night wa not perfect this group wa due to start their event at pm and keep the party going until am i came on shift at pm a soon a i walk in the door there is a man drumline and guy playing bagpipe in our restaurant and they are not quiet the noise from them is so loud that i m having to scream at guest to check them in thankfully most of my check in were more people from this group and were actually happy to see the band i didn t share their enthusiasm but wa grateful no one wa upset by it around pm the band stopped playing and the dinner for the event began which meant our entire lobby and restaurant went from a mass parade of people and noise to dead silence it wa ghost town level quiet i loved it i managed to get the last of my check in taken care of some for the big group and some were rd party stay and even helped a small family gathering that wa hosting a little girl s birthday party nothing big just her her parent and some friend for a pool and pizza party we don t allow food and drink in the pool area so i let the family use one of the empty meeting room that the massive group didn t book they were grateful and tipped me and the two other staff member who helped them out a nice each the massive group s dinner ended around pm and they consumed our bar and restaurant again the lobby wa bursting with people in fancy dress expensive tux and lot of red fez hat i m not kidding they are that kind of old school organization by pm they had gone from loud to loud and drunk my head wa beginning to hurt and i asked our engineer to watch the desk while i ran away to the restroom i decided to use the restroom in the pool area so i had an excuse to check on the pool party people they had already gone to their room and another family wa using the pool area now i picked up some towel that had been thrown about and mopped up a few puddle then headed on to the restroom at pm i just finished washing my hand and go to dry them when the light go out i first thought that the light were set to a motion sensor and i just stood still for too long so i wave my arm about a i walk to the door and the light don t come on i open the restroom a the family in the pool start saying it s ok the power will come back on i panic i whip out my phone and turn on my flashlight i walk to the pool area and see the parent and their kid in the water still i ask if everyone is ok and they say they re fine i ask them to get out of the water and come to me so that i can lead them out and to their room i explain that until the power come back on we need to shut down the pool area they understood and i shined the light on a clear path and walked them out to the stairwell thankfully they were staying on the rd floor and our emergency power wa working to light the stairwell i met up with our other staff member and the mod and we discussed what wa going on we thought the massive group must have blown a fuse and our engineer wa already checking on it turn out the entire neighborhood wa dark and no one knew why the group wa asking what wa going on but most of them were just drunk and confused not scared or upset our emergency light kept a good portion of the restaurant and bar area lit up while my half of the lobby wa dark except for some candle and flashlight to light the path to the elevator and stair elevator later came on due to emergency power and our phone a well a one computer at my desk wa working after the initial curiosity wore off the entire group wa laughing that they party so hard they shut the entire neighborhood down they were also happy that our bar and restaurant were still open and serving despite the now limited option guest were calling from their room asking what wa going on and after ensuring that they weren t hurt in their room i just explained that we were working on it and power would return shortly that answer wasn t enough for this one entitled girl eg so when is the power coming back on me we are waiting to hear back from the power company at this time i can give you a callback and let you know once we have an answer if you d like eg well is the pool closed me yes miss we have shut down the pool and fitness area until power can be restored it s not safe to be in there at this time eg this is b i want a full refund right now me miss i understand you re upset and do apologize for the inconvenience however we are not able to make that decision at this time eg you re not refunding me i paid a lot of money to stay here either open the pool or give me back my money me miss i cannot do that at this time eg i m sending my boyfriend down there to talk to you this is unbelievable he s gonna kick your as you stupid b tch she ended the call and i just rolled my eye i remembered checking the two of them in they were staying on a super cheap rd party rate and weren t apart of the massive group or the pool party i pulled up their reservation and quickly wrote down the information needed to hand off to the mod in case thing did get ugly while doing so the power company called u with an automated message saying they were working on it the engineer also stopped by and told me he saw an update on the power company s website that stated we may get power back around pm second after the engineer walked off the boyfriend came down to the desk and wa running sideways to me and crashed into my desk almost knocking a lit candle over on me he wa clearly drunk bf oh uh hey my girlfriend just called down can i get your

off the elevator looking for him and gave me dagger stare a she stomped into the crowd to find him i didn t pay much mind to her and went back to what i wa doing at pm our power came back on and at around pm my bartender came up to me and started unloading on me about how everyone wa loving the power outage except this one young couple who she and her staff never served but were clearly wasted and tried to order drink she turned them away because the guy wa in a t shirt and swim trunk while the girl wa wearing a bikini with a tank top over it our restaurant doe have a dress code so doe the bar you can t be dressed like that and expect to be served i laughed and told her about the angry phone call i got from the bikini girl wanting a refund my bartender gaped and then told me she overheard them arguing after she turned them away from the bar the girlfriend tried to argue with my bartender about being turned away and the boyfriend went pale and dragged her away when he realized they were being stared at and laughed at by all the people in the fancy thread my bartender told me their argument wa more the boyfriend begging to either go back to the room or go home the girlfriend wa fuming and wanted her refund the boyfriend offered to pay her back and she accused him of being embarrassed of her he actually nodded and said yes loudly and in her face she shoved him and ran off angry they must have made up later on because before i left i saw them playing around in the pool after hour i told my security guy to just leave it be for another hour but to keep an eye on them i got told later they just went to their room a little while after i left tried to do a late checkout and were denied trashed the hotel room and did call my gm wanting a refund my gm heard the story from me and just shrugged it off and let me make the phone call explaining that not only wa her request denied but due to her behavior on property she isn t welcome back i love my job
without any warning about half of the workforce wa out of a job it break my heart that they are out of a job because we were all so well connected so naturally since we were so close physically and litterally we inquired about our hotel not demanding anything just wondering if we were up for sale and if we had job the gm got furious at our accusation and basically brushed off the question no one feel any job security my shuttle driver is puking his brain out just cause he s afraid to call in meanwhile an ex night auditor at the sister location call me and tell me our pay ha been screwed up that whoever s is doing payroll gm is screwing up putting in the time ex instead of in s ex and shorting our time i m afraid to speak out or go against them because i really don t want to lose another job but the owner and the gm are acting very strange and i don t like it
i feel enough time ha passed for me to finally be able to speak about this a while ago when i had just started waitressing i served a delightful party of about the host loved me the kid drew picture for me and i wa tipped nearly on a rather big bill they decided they want to come back a few month later for the mother birthday can t remember how old she wa turning but it wa a milestone and i begged my manager to let me do the table my manager allowed it the evening started off okay everyone wa happy the father wa my main focus a he had a lot of special requirement eventually it wa time to bring out the birthday cake and place it in front of the mother everyone wa taking video and singing i put the cake in front of the wrong fucking person with a smile on my face i had been focusing so much on the father that i had a massive brain fart and thought the cake should go to him he looked a bit confused and that wa when the host ran to me whispering my mom my mom i turned beet red grabbed that cake and rushed it to the mother before running away to the kitchen to find a chef kind enough to kill me with a very sharp knife lucky for me the host wa very understanding and wa still happy to tip me thank god for kind customer
it s been a fun couple day here answering the phone you see apparently there wa a big basketball tournament scheduled for this weekend but due to some storm rolling through the tournament wa cancelled at the last minute i find it kind of baffling that they would cancel an indoor sport due to rain but i digress word of the cancellation must have gone out late thursday or friday because that s when the phone started ringing people who had booked room for the weekend were calling left and right to cancel their reservation the problem is most of these people had booked our advance purchase non refundable rate because those are generally the cheapest rate we offer so one call after another it wa i m sorry but the rate you booked is non refundable you agreed to these term when you reserved the room of course no one saw anything on their reservation to that effect their eye must have passed right over the big bold non refundable that wa right there next to the rate that they clicked either that or they think that they re a special exception because surely non refundable mean non refundable unless i tell you why i m cancelling honestly i wish our hotel would just stop offering these rate because it seems like more trouble than it s worth and most of the one that get escalated to a manager get refunded anyway all it doe is create a headache when people inevitably want to cancel
i had a new one happen today someone managed to completely shut down the waffle station in the first five minute of opening breakfast some time ago like year our brand added waffle maker and such to the line up i hated it then and i hate them now it s a mess to prepare maintain and clean up after especially with group of kid that said in the last six year i ve never had someone twist off the valve instead of pressing the lever resulting in a full container of batter going all over the station cabinet and floor so no le than five minute after opening we have to ask people to wait while we clean up the colossal mess created by this tactical genius maybe i m just venting but i thought in year i had seen it all and yet tourist continue to show me new and exciting thing at my own property that said i d take the fact i now smell like waffle batter over other thing
in the s i worked in a busy dt room hotel where we had a contract with the national airline to house flight crew when they were in town on layover the room rate were extremely low typically about of rack rate it wa master billed so no one wa out of pocket but these guy still wanted to be treated like royalty they didn t have the same check in procedure a normal guest we would just get a list each day check in king room for pilot and double room for flight attendant and put the key in a binder when they arrived they would sign in and take the key of the room next to their name their contract prevented u from giving them any other room type and generally we avoided messing around with them a much a we could they would often arrive at the hotel in foul mood so we tried to minimize the interaction one weekend we had a large irish dance group in house and the usually le than desirable double room wa in hot demand after allocating all of the group room i wa checking in air crew and i came up one double short we had a room on each floor the room that wa called a consular suite and it wa about twice the size of a normal room wa very tastefully decorated with furniture like a couch dining room table for and a big screen tv rare in the s they were often booked out a small meeting room they had a murphy bed that folded up into the wall frequently during sold out night we would upgrade select guest to consular suite and we would have to explain to guest what the murphy bed wa and reassure them it wa a comfortable bed it wa in fact a full box spring and mattress not a cot it just folded up into the wall furthermore a the bed were used le frequently they were actually more comfortable so a i wa short one double i chose to randomly upgrade one flight attendant to a consular suite a that room type wa not in demand the flight wa due to arrive before the end of my shift so i could deal with it personally when the crew arrived the pilot signed in first got their key and went upstairs a the fa s were signing in i broached the topic and told the nice lady that i had upgraded her making sure to use that word i told her about the size and amenity of the consular suite and then mentioned the murphy bed the lady went bat shit crazy seriously in a second flat she said you can t do that it s in our contract we are guaranteed a good bed say so in in the contract we re the biggest airline etc etc most of what she said wa true but she really wa getting an upgrade one of her cooler headed colleague suggested she at least look at the room before she dismissed it they moved to the elevator and were gone for minute then she wa back nice room but bed is unacceptable contract state we can t give them cot she ll call corporate get me fired etc i should have cut my loss moved her to a double called it a day but i persisted no one wa screwing up my perfect room allocation i had worked so hard on i went to the room with her pulled the bed down and had her check it out she did and after much harumphing humming and hawing she deemed the bed acceptable but reminded me of their contract one last time did not hear from her again and that crew checked out at the next morning so did not see her leave and we did not hear from corporate end of story month later i wa on a front desk shift and i wa covering the switchboard when i heard flight crew checking in i heard a female voice say to my colleague in kind of a wistful voice i always wondered what those consular suite are like on each floor do you think i could get one of those instead of the regular room i went to the desk and immediately recognized her and she recognized me i said in a very matter of fact way that the airline contract stated they were entitled to only the room type that wa reserved for her i finished the statement with a big smirk she turned on her heel and walked a way to her double room small victory but a victory nonetheless

no the title is not a real quote but it s something i ve noticed numerous time now i m officially on night audit full time and i just checked in a woman and her family into a room with a single king bed and a pullout sofa she had booked queen but someone on the day shift switched it presumably because we re sold out now there s nothing wrong with our pullout bed they just happen to be pullout they re all le than a year old and kept clean and tidy she of course call down and say it s a problem but they ll deal with it tonight because it s almost in the morning but that tomorrow night she hope her kid will be sleeping in a real bed said with the usual threatening tone i get why she s upset i do and i apologized for it but i always find it fascinating that these people like to use their kid sadness a a threat my kid aren t going to sleep well my kid were up all night because of the pullout or my kid absolutely cannot sleep on a pullout well alright then if they can t sleep on the pullout why don t you you can t just take one for your kid and sleep on the pullout instead while they sleep in the real bed i wasn t spoiled a a child and didn t get what i wanted when i wanted it but my mother is the kind of person who would gladly have gone hungry for the day if she had to choose between feeding me and my sister or herself she also would have slept on the pullout if it wa bothering me

so i work audit at this well known hotel we lock our main door for security purpose because in the past we had a lot of homeless people come in and sleep in the most random place at our property the thing is the card reader won t read guest key card so i have to get up and open the door for em what annoys me the most is the look that they give me it s for everyone s security another thing that irritates me it s kinda funny though is the way people just stand there for weird period of time staring at the door looking confused a to why the door won t open they don t even try to read the sign about the door being locked it s right there it s no big deal but i just wanted to share
easily my favorite part of being a server despite the rather short time frame is the child they re adorable sweet quirky and love to tell me all about their day new toy school whatever i can easily hold a fifteen minute conversation about paw patrol and i have an epic arsenal of silly face to pull for them they can be awful but they like me a lot so i ve not had to deal with anything terrible yet but they re such little danger magnet i had a toddler half fall out of a booster seat and if i hadn t caught him he would have slammed his face into the table and ended up in the floor and hot pan oh the hot pan every time i set something down that is even remotely above warm i ve got a kid at the table reaching for it i tend to catch it before the parent do and i always feel bad snatching tiny finger and gently moving them away had a baby girl go for some bread stick which would have been fine if they weren t beyond hot i can handle a bit of singed finger tip when i hold a sauce cup but child finger do not need to be put into it they don t need to touch the hot bowl for pasta the dessert is tasty but the foil is like lava poor kiddos they re just hungry and excited little danger magnet

i ve worked and helped out at a couple hotel and have seen some odd review but the strangest one have to be when they complain about what news channel is on during breakfast i first heard about this being a thing last year from a coworker who saw a review from someone complaining about foxy news being on during breakfast but i wrote it off a a one time wack occurrence then recently i saw a hotel i used to work for get a low score simply for having seenn on for of the guest s stay he said everything else wa good but he wa outraged it wa on for two consecutive stay and insisted there wa no remote available to change it even though i know we kept the remote in the lobby and my old gm responded there is in deed the ability to change the channel like do people not realize maybe the hotel isn t involved in the corporate news war and maybe a guest put it on i literally turn the weather on now to avoid the frivolous complaint

i ve always been a non tipped server a decent hourly wage and occasional tip from regular or big event i fill out my tax form with a claim of but then have them take about to cover anything and hopefully get a return in february so far so good but there s a chance i may move into tipped hourly if i get this job so for those of you who make similar hourly rate and claim all your cash tip what do you write to make sure everything or most everything get taken care of so you owe very little or get a return in spring i would claim all my cash tip because i have to do thing with my credit refinance a loan buy a house a car apply for a new line of credit all that stuff
to the guy who split out on his tab while i wa out of view for second go screw yourself and we have you on camera also s o to my last table for tipping me for both bill when you found out what happened
today i wa helping a server out by dropping off his ticket he wa serving in the bar and had written down the wrong bar top number but didn t tell anyone a i walked up and put the food down the customer looked at me and said we didn t order this i apologized and grabbed for it and the guy go i ll eat it though and stuck his hand in the food and took out a chunk the woman who it wa intended for watched in horror the guy looked at me a laughed i picked it up and said are you kidding me are you seriously kidding me to which he responds oh come on you can still give it to her i told him now i have to throw this away and we have to remake her meal so he say okay then leave it here i ll eat it and i told him no i said he didn t order it and food isn t free finally he say you know what i ll just pay for it and grabbed it out of my hand what a stupid fucker
this is a short one to appease the tale god i had a guest checking in today to my little schmoliday out and his father had made the reservation through an ota with his card when the guest tried to check in i told him we needed a card and a photo id which he refused his reasoning wa that his father wa paying for the room spoiler alert gt there wa no cc auth on file for it so we couldn t run it lt he wa pissed saying that the hotel should have told him not our problem since he didn t even want to provide a card he then told me to help the next guy in line who joked around with him a little bit before the rude guest told him to mind his own business under his breath next guy check in and lo and behold he s a top teir guy who seems like the one who actually treat people well once the reward guy is in rude guy come back to check in and asks rather haughtily if we have any room for tonight i tell him we do and then he tell me that he s been on the road for a while i m thinking a if that s any excuse for being a jackass not only to me but to another guest a he checked in i sell him the room because he did look like he just needed a place to stay and the tt didn t seem too offput by it so all wa well he wound up coming back down asking about the wifi and seemed in better spirit then tl dr rude guy come in with a reservation made by his father doesn t have a cc auth blame the hotel for his attempt at credit card fraud and then mutter under his breath loud enough for me to hear for a tt to mind his own business check in after making his own reservation and go up to his room edit he just came back in from dinner and apologized i m sure i don t need to tell y all how rare that is
can host be written up for having their phone out while guest are upfront waiting for their table it s a really bad problem where i m at and i wanna know how to stop coworkers from being on their phone all the time the worst part is they don t even bring it to the back or try to hide it from guest they know it s wrong too cause they are scared a manager will come upfront
i ve worked at a diner for the last month it s honestly been a nightmare crazy coworkers people quitting ridiculous understaffing and disorganization basically no one really care it s family owned and we have no management other than the rich couple who bought it my bos hasn t paid me for some of my holliday pay and i texted him about it again last night he responded this morning with a nasty message saying that he should instead deduct my pay for an extra hour i stayed sunday i stayed to help close because not enough people were scheduled i m honestly at a breaking point i m giving away my other shift this week and debating just to not come in again i have been trying to find job in my field for the past week with no luck yet health research i don t have another job lined up and i m scared i ll regret this i do have saving and i m living at home so my expense are really low should i just say fuck it and leave i don t make that much money anyways to be honest on mobile so sorry if this wa hard to read
all night i worked by myself a the only hostess every time i went to sit one table three others at by themselves the server were overwhelmed we had one busser she wa also overwhelmed i wa running around helping everyone and doing everything one of my server yelling at me to do my fucking job right by the rth hour of nonstop panic i had a panic attack i wa trying to control my breathing but there wa nowhere to hide the despair on my face you sat at the bar and saw it all i found out later an hour before closing you were a table of seven just didn t know who to talk to since i wa running around like a madwoman i apologized a million time but instead of chewing me out you said it s okay don t worry about it we can wait i laughed in relief at finally being treated like a human i told you i d seat you a soon a i could but you said we re not in a rush whenever you have room we re okay here and you re doing great by the end of the night your party arrived and you told me we re just going to get a few drink and get out of here don t worry about u you did great i had tear in my eye i felt like i wa drowning in so much i had to do i couldn t even start my closing side work because i wa still seating people by the last min before pm i hope the dessert i sent to you at the end out of pocket wa enough to thank you for treating me like a human and for telling me what i really needed to hear in that hour p i ve talked to my manager and i told them i refuse to work alone ever again and if i work alone i will be walking out a panic attack and almost a second one with nonstop running and mental stress are not worth an hour edit the server wa spoke to and he apologized to my today and i could tell it wa sincere all is good my second hostess ha been promised hopefully i wont wver have to deal with that again thanks so much for everyone s kind word of support
i m going to preface that while this one involves an angry guest his anger wa completely justifiable i harbor no ill will toward said guest this woman who work the desk before i get in on the other hand so this woman ha worked here for some time now and she is always making mistake some big some small but all thing she should know better by now she ha messed up so many reservation i ve had to fix on my audit shift that i ve stopped counting i barely even complain about her anymore tonight though one of her mistake got me fuming enter angry guest he wa never checked into our system for some reason unknown it s not that hard a process seriously it s two button on the computer she ha done this time at this point she know if a reg card is signed the button need to be pressed so i check him in before audit and leave a very polite note stating the issue that it is our fault and we d like to resolve it am he s in my lobby absolutely irate that i m asking for his information again he refuse to provide it yell at me some more tell me to talk to his group leader yell some more and then stomp off to his room completely understandable to me i would be pretty pissed if i were in his shoe and while nothing excuse the thing he said to me i am still way more angry at the idiot who neglected to check the guest in so please folk if someone sign the reg card just check them into the system save your night auditor s sanity
i m starting to wonder if people are just incredibly lazy and sheltered of if i m just being unhelpful so this kid i m guessing yo came to the fd asking about pizza delivery this is a medium size city but it s poorly served with late night snack option specially on a tuesday at am luckily there is one place that work h i gave him the menu flyer from the place that ha pizza wing sub etc and he asked if we could order now i refused to believe that he wa expecting me to order his food but apparently that s what he wanted i tried to be funny and said but i don t know what darling i might order some weird stuff that you won t like hahaha so i dialed and passed the phone to him he didn t seemed impressed some min later and he call me upset asking if my food is still coming today at this point he wa so drunk i had to ask him to repeat the question time to understand the slurred speech with my patience gone i just told him that i don t work for the pizza place so i can t give any info about his order he answered ok you don t care i get it and hang up at this very moment the delivery guy walk in now is this a common thing i ve been working here for year and to this day no one ever requested this kind of service from me maybe in a fancy property but this is a medium range small business hotel
i really need to keep track of my money what s the best app you ve found
the reason why this is starting to happen is because one of the manager at my job failed corporate inspection and if he get his rd strike he is fired so he s cracking down on employee that are listening to music on the clock anywhere or having a comp percentage that s above which i find to be a bullshit reason especially if said comp aren t the fault of the server so far almost all of the server including me have gotten written up for our comp being over even and apparently you can get fired if you get written up for the same reason time or someone can get write ups for completely different reason and get fired
when you work in hotel you quickly learn that some of the most interesting story come from rd shift antic i don t often work rd shift but i do get the pleasure of reading the shift summary this happened a couple month ago at approximately p m an unidentified guest approached the front desk while i officer filch wa in the area he stated there wa a guy at the pool table who wa highly intoxicated and asked if we could escort him back to his room i agreed to go look into the situation and upon arriving at the pool table outside of the leaky cauldron i could immediately tell the guest in question later identified a mr malfoy wa intoxicated by his stumbling and demeanor i politely introduced myself and notified the guest that he is no longer able to order alcohol and that he would need to be escorted to his room the guest at this point asked me who do you think you are i advised him i wa security he then got very close to me and said fuck off he then said he wa going to get a drink the guest then went to the small table near the table and finished off what i am assuming to be some alcoholic beverage before continuing on with his verbal onslaught of fuck you and go fuck yourself i remained curteous a he continued to berate me security officer mr norris showed up and i explained again to the guest that he is no longer allowed to order alcohol and he ha to go back to his room or we will have to take further action such a involving the local police he smiled and tell me again to fuck myself before going to sit at the bar against my order i motion to and notify bartender hagrid that the guest is cut off and hagrid tell him the same the guest order a water and hagrid serf it in a cup with a lid so that we can have the guest leave with his water in hand the guest refuse to leave the leaky caldron and i confirm with mr norris that if he continues to refuse we will have to get the police involved i notify the guest that those are his option and he once again repeat himself by cursing at u i gestured to mr norris and informed him of the guest s decision mr norris notified dispatch to call the guest got up and continued to behave in a belligerent manner the guest began to exit the leaky caldron and mr norris and myself follow him advising him we are only going to ensure he go to his room he continued to curse u and approached mr norris and poked her in the chest the guest then started to get more aggessive he then threw his drink on the ground and attempted to rip a large picture off the wall mr norris grabbed the picture in an attempt to prevent it from being pulled off the wall the guest at this point headed towards the rd floor mezzanine elevator on the south wing and began making jerking motion apparently trying to antagonize u the two of u remained calm he then became angrier and began attempting to break thing knocking over chair smacking lamp and trying to remove more picture from the wall he then began running from u going around the corner on south we found him foot around the corner attempting to hide the guest then went to the elevator before trying to block mr norris and myself from entering i entered the elevator by simply walking through the barricade he made with his arm and waited inside with the guest while mr norris entered speaking with dispatch the guest grabbed mr norris name tag from her shirt and grabbed her phone radio from his hand he began banging the phone on thing while running towards the stair he then threatened to drop the phone down the elevator shaft before bolting again down the stair and down the hall through primrose to firewheel with mr norris following him attempting to get him to comply at one point the guest went into the restroom and ran water onto mr norris phone radio the guest then go over to the elevator by the pool table and begin to say even more demeaning thing to u including but not limited to tell him to go hang yourself after i acknowledged that i had heard this the guest became loud and then once again took off for upstairs during this time the guest began to physically lay hand on both mr norris and myself in form of poking pushing and slapping we continued to simply follow the guest and intervene during his bout of destruction the guest began to get more physical a we neared the ping pong table the guest grabbed and ripped the window out of the frame and threw it on the ground he came towards me and unzipped my jacket i pushed his hand away from me the guest proceeded to throw my badge breaking it in the elevator he also reached and grabbed mr norris earpiece from his ear and threw it he began attempting to tear up the ping pong table michael attempted to intervene to prevent him from destroying more property he then grabbed mr norris glass from her face which severely damaged them the guest then came around the corner towards me ramming his shoulder into me i then grabbed him and attempted to protect myself by restraining him with my hand i felt he wa now a physical threat to mr norris and myself during the restraint attempt the guest viciously bit mr norris on the left hand drawing blood he bit me on the left forearm but did not break the skin he left a red mark that wa very close to breaking the skin the front desk agent heard the commotion and came to assist fda assisted u in slowly placing mr malfoy on the ground while holding mr malfoy he bit the fda on the lower right rib area mr malfoy continued to scream and curse and attempt to get loose myself and fda held him down until a police officer came to the scene and placed him in handcuff mr malfoy wa arrested and transported to the county jail officer norris wa transported via ambulance to the hospital due to the severity of his bite wound name of people and place have obviously been changed merry christmas

this is my first job serving last night i did it i have severe social anxiety but i am so happy that i waited table and wa getting the hang of it only thing it s a little out of my comfort zone and a much a i love it it can be hard sometimes a lot of the girl are so outgoing and dancing and my body language is a little awkward i hope once in there and get used to everything that ll come out but i m just wondering is it normal for someone to feel that way there first day hoping so any tip to let loose and just have fun anyone have anxiety

this is now the second customer that s come to me through the night i m the na at my hotel complaining about the price of their room i guess when booking they were told our rate before tax and fee not with them included which i can understand but really when your already paying for a night what s an extra of tax i unfortunately cant just make the tax disappear and there no real reason to cut down the price of their room just because they didnt realize there were tax i will never understand some guest
earlier in the week i wa checking in a lady who had stated her husband wa not here yet whose name wa on the reservation thankfully she wa written on the reservation so that wasn t a problem but her husband s credit card wa used to take the deposit room tax and without having it in person we can t keep it on that card so i ask this lady who had given me her card if she d like to use this card for the room tax and incidental since her husband card wa on file and she said no just leave it on his card i then explained to her our policy in which we couldn t unless we were to have it in person and she almost cut me off loudly yelling why did you even ask then i look to my right to see my coworker laughing under his breath and take a breath i just want to be sure you re okay with using your card instead oh okay random unneeded outburst i guess i continue with the checkin and give her the key to her room she then come back almost immediately asking for a room with more of a view a hers faced our courtyard i let her know our hotel doesn t really have good view a it state and show online but i could give her an outward facing room if she d like i show her the room first so i don t waste her time and she go oh so it s a view of the parking lot i repeat exactly what i said before about view and she shrug it off and say she ll take that room min later she come back to the desk saying she want to use one of our bike so i give her the waiver and send her to valet not even min later she come back saying i left the bike out there because there wa no one at valet the brake were really bad so i didn t even bother mind you they are cruiser bike to use on the flat path by the beach and can brake by single gear reverse pedal i walked out a soon a she went by the desk and our valet attendant wa right outside putting the bike away she must not have even waited second i talked with the valet attendant and he said she first tried to take someone else s bike parked at our rack and when she wa told it wa a guest s she said do you think he ll notice i just couldn t stop laughing at this chick she did some other shenanigan but in the end i just wonder how these people affect others around them
goddamn just got whole buck on a lunch bill the service went perfect didn t deserve it this time what s a time in your career you earned on
had a terrible week from customer complaining about food amp price and acting a if i made the decision and purposely wanted to scam them and rip them off to the shop being broken into last night like customer can be so toxic sometimes in how they treat you i had anxiety after the customer complaint call i received because obviously i had done nothing wrong it wa deliveroo order and i m not in the kitchen so i don t make it but she spoke a if i did and made me feel like that it felt like when my ex used get angry at me when i did nothing wrong we were broken into last night and the place wa trashed thankfully nothing of great importance wa taking they took some stock amp tried to sell it at local pub lol and completely trashed the place which took hour to clean today a a result we opened hour later than normal and had a limited menu because half our stock wa thrown out a it had been left to defrost overnight or scattered all over the floor yet people still got annoyed at me that we weren t open for our usual hour and that we didn t have our full menu i m sorry you got broken into but i m really disappointed i came all this way can you not just make me something quick even though you re closed and then because i have the classic resting bitch face and i don t act overly sickly sweet to customer this one guy decided i wa angry and communicated with my bos saying i wa being rude and angry the audio and visual recording we have of the transaction prove otherwise but with all this going on i m so stressed out and anxious i feel like it s hurting my soul how do you guy remain detached or just brush it off when people are treating you like shit and being emotionally abusive bonus i developed stress hiccup after this week which could be a lot worse my friend s leg swell up due to stress but is very annoying
right at the end of my shift today we had a customer walk in this guy wa a lulu he wa so wasted that he could have been labeled a biohazard he wa so stoned that three sculptor were bidding on him his body wa always pointing at due north he wa so many sheet to the wind that he could have held a white sale he wa so plastered that his mother named him drywall get my drift he had apparently come through drive thru approximately minute before but he had the bag with his sandwich in his hand which he then proceeded to set down on a table goodness only know what had been going on in that minute he came over to me and wanted to buy a shake to go with his sandwich it took several minute to understand through his ramblings what flavor and size he wanted and then how he didn t want two of the topping including one that we didn t have but did want the third one this entire time i wa trying to figure out exactly how much longer this guy wa going to be able to remain on his foot he had gotten a straw out of it s paper packaging and dropped it on the floor he bent to pick it up dropping some sauce packet which he finally wa able to pick up mostly he also asked if we were going to get one particular sauce in a take home packet i told him that we did have it and he said no i mean this sauce yes we have it he wa in a very high heaven he then took the straw that he had chased around on the floor and stuck it into his shake sipping away i cringed ewww after i made his shake and gave it to him he asked if i wa a manager nope well he would like to talk to a manager for a compliment okay i went to the manager that i generally have the most issue with and let her have the rest of the fun it took a good five minute of his toked up talk before he finally left and he started to leave his sandwich behind i managed to get his attention long enough for him to grab it my final thought wa wondering if there wa anything we could do to keep him off of the road but by the time we would be able to call the police he would be gone i just hope that the rest of the city wa safe from his driving
sorry for ranting i m one anxious peanut and i d like to thank you if you read this it really mean a lot to me so i just recently started working at this salad bar and got put on many morning shift i ve probably done shift myself with no proper training i guess they assume i d automatically know with common sense work is alright and the owner are actually really nice but i m terrified of the manager today i accidentally burnt a whole bucket of broccoli and coudnt wash up any dish a i a serving a difficult and fussy customer then i got told off real bad when my manager came in told her my situation but she said that i should ve finished my job before serving the customer i served her a little earlier before the scheduled opening time mistake started to pile up a im a really anxious person and kept making mistake after mistake i have a shift tomorrow and the manager is coming in to show me how to open to store properly i m screwed cause i opened up a new batch of soup instead of using the old one i wa told by the bos that we were supposed to rotate the soup we use but eek what do i know totally terrified of getting told off for tomorrow and potentially even wasting more food then got a call just now from the owner s daughter she wa really nice and diplomatic about it but regardless i feel like shit making so many goddamn mistake today i m having exam currently and my mom being sick ha gave me a mountain of anxiety that s affecting my work severely how do you recharge stop making mistake after feeling like shit after the first one following mistake putting dirty measuring cup with the clean one giving a regular customer a smaller serving size he used his own container and i wasn t used to it putting sauce on the side of the salad instead of putting it in a separate small container communication error misreading an order and making an extra order instead god how do i recharge and go in work tomorrow morning with a fresh mind thank you for your patience for reading till this far xx
our bar close at pm that s admittedly kind of early but we re not a large hotel so there s not nearly enough traffic on most night to warrant it being open later we don t sell beer or wine in our market so after pm the property is completely dry keep in mind we re in the south so alcohol law are very strict around here i don t know if local law dictate our license only let s u sell up to pm but it s a good bet that it doe so i m not messing around with it a woman came up one time around and said her group missed last call because they were all chatting on the other side of the bar not paying attention she asked if i could come pour her a vodka tonic i told her i m not licensed to pour drink and that the bar wa closed anyway of course she just say something along the line of no no that s ok i can tell you what to do i told her that doesn t matter and that i m not legally allowed to pour drink i also reiterated that our liquor license is very strict on when we can sell alcohol she just wasn t getting it and kept persisting getting more and more agitated a i kept shutting her down then she just stormed away after the th time of me saying no yes i actually counted how many time i had to say no all her coworkers gave me the stinkface on their way back up to the room then last night minute after the bar closed a different guy come up to the desk visibly furious he say the lady at the bar just told me they re closed and that i can not have a drink i am a snowflake tier elite member and demand to be accommodated i recite the usual i m sorry the bar closed and were only legally allowed to sell up to pm he responds with something like i do not give a shit about any of that now are you going to come pour me a drink or tell me to fuck off i didn t know what to say because i wa just blown away with how childish he wa being so i just stared back at him he eventually got the message and just left cursing the whole way down the hallway people need to grow up you re not a yr old sophomore in college alcohol is not that important i ll never understand casual dependency on alcohol a lot of people have it s not even that they have a problem with it there s just a societal pressure to have a drink with coworkers after a day in the office come on it s pm on a tuesday night you have to work tomorrow go to sleep karen

so this story is throwing it way back a few year ago when i worked at my first hotel at the time i wa doing a little bit of everything housekeeping front desk laundry you name it i wa their gal just like most hotel we got a lot of business from our local company in the area and got some business guy from the bigger national company it just so happens that we had this guy from an electric company staying with u each week during the week and he went home on the weekend this went on for quite awhile with him staying with u anyways he never wanted his room serviced my gm at the time had experienced a lot in the past so after three day with a dnd sign up she would do a wellness check just to be on the safe side of thing well to our surprise everything is fine but there are a lot of various toy in his room our gm s reaction to this wa probably the most priceless part of the story but it s rather inappropriate lol needle to say the housekeeper never worried about cleaning his room again however once the word passed around the small property i had the luxury of checking him in the following week and it wa very awkward because i knew and we speculated that we had never saw him bring anyone in with him throughout his stay with u needle to say i applaud him for making the most of his business trip but sometimes thing are better left unknown
yes princess surprisingly enough you re not the only people in town to want to eat at pm on a friday night ah and now you re gonna flounce out after even demanding to speak to the owner didn t magically make a table appear so unusual for someone with such reasonable expectation i m just so heartbroken that being said i primarily work weekend and we are always on a wait on those night so i m pretty used to the first part of this little drama so despite all their bullshit i remain a professional and promptly still alert them when a very nice table open for this group a whole five minute earlier than their accurately quoted wait because i don t just lie to customer about long wait for fun i assume they re going to petulantly cancel but whatever i ll have tried nope it is here that this party earns a solid place on my top ten most asshole party list they answer back and say they re on the way please hold the table for them when we follow up after a very generous twenty minute they instantly reply almost there of course they never fucking show back up at all hope you got your petty as pleasure out of making other people wait for an additional half hour for no reason like it s not the underpaid hostess you re making suffer bitch it s other customer may karma kick you squarely in the ball
i work a a house person at an upscale hotel this mean i take care of laundry do turn down if i work the night shift and clean up the public hotel space including the public restroom now most people know woman s bathroom have the little trash can in each stall for throwing away sanitary item like pad this is gross enough because a lot of lady don t wrap up their bloody item and just toss them in open faced there s always weird item shoved into those little box that would have probably been better to dispose of in the larger trash can i have found dirty underwear vapes soiled adult diaper puke you name it i ve found it the other day i wa cleaning the bathroom for the night and emptying all the little bin i get to the large stall and there is nothing in the pin except for what i can only guess to be a catheter bag i m talking a bag that s at least floz filled with pee just sitting in there the hotel i work at also ha a single person bathroom for family or people who need more privacy it seems like that maybe would be the better option when changing out your pee bag
so i have a mace gun and it look like a real gun safety and all like bruh i dare somebody to come at me it is always on me attached to my back but i never had to use it but thhheeennnnn it wa winter time i wa minding my own business like usual drinking coffee and reading a book when a really weird dude came in he asked to sit in the lobby and wait for his friend i said sure i figured his car broke down and wa waiting for a ride i thought he wouldn t be here long well he sat in the far back corner of my hotel lobby staring at me ok well i ignored him i wa enjoying my book his friend came in she had a reservation she gave me the confirmation number i found the reservation however her credit card declined she said that is impossible and asked me to run it again i did still declined i changed the expiration date still nothing well my hotel ha to have card that authorizes for the full amount percent of incidental in case they destroy the room it show there is money on the card we will take cash but the card still ha to authorize until they check out she tried to pay with cash her card did not authorize and i told her to call her bank and let them know that it is you and that is probably a flag on the account happens a lot with hotel she didn t listen to me and started telling me to take the cash i told her i cannot do that the card is declining the creepy dude went to the men s restroom during this she told me to delete the reservation and she want me to print out ten copy of the cancellation number to make sure she doesn t get charged i told her i can write down the cancellation number and make her copy but i cannot print them out because the software we use won t let me she started screaming at me and everything she got very aggressive she wa getting violent she wa jumping at me and reaching for me i started slowly walking away to go to the back room she started screaming at me more and then jumped over the counter at me and i reached behind my back took out the mace gun and pointed it directly at her i yelled at her to get out i am not saying the cuss word i screamed just know they were screamed i yelled at her to leave she got quiet stared at me and starting walking towards me i took the safety off and quietly told her i will shoot you dude she finally stopped and turned to leave but stopped in her track i started counting down from and she finally left i instantly ran and locked myself in the employee restroom called and stayed there till they got to the hotel i told them there wa a weird dude in the bathroom still that wa associated with her i called my gm and manager they re friend so they re typically together and they started watching the camera to make sure he stayed in the bathroom till the police came when the police came i slowly came out and told them what happened two went to the restroom and found him walking up and down the hall talking to himself they asked what he wa up to and he started cussing them out and walking away from them they pinned him to a wall and cuffed him they arrested him and a they were walking through the lobby the guy wa talking to them saying i m being arrested right now what do you guy think i should do they weren t very nice about it either he wa on something another cop came in and searched the restroom and found he did smoke something in the bathroom but the creepy dude kept the evidence on him until the cop searched him the woman though wa being questioned outside refused to leave the property and claimed i took a gun out on her understandable though look like a gun the cop that wa talking to her took my mace gun and brought it to her to show her it wasn t a gun he then took picture for the court in case she tried to say i pointed a gun at her the cop left after i gave my statement and a report my bos told me to go to the break room and eat some ice cream to help calm me down sugar make me feel calm when i am stressed one thing i learned from that night though i got some fast reflex
i ve got a new story to tell so i arrive at work a little before midnight count the float settle in etc i then realize that i need to take a shit a i m doing so i can hear someone trying to open the locked door to the front office it a small building more of a two bedroom house with a front desk instead of a porch despite realizing it locked this person try again and again who know maybe it ll magically open the sixth time i hurry up and get out there and see a middle aged lady wearing a grey nightgown and no shoe while it warmed up in my province it still below c and at night once inside the office she asks me if i enjoy the sound of people having sex and i can tell she s annoyed she also smell like a goddamn brewery i say no and then she launch into an rant about how she pay to be here they don t she think they re on welfare and she shouldn t have to pay tax to hear fuckin and that we ve had to warn this room once already bos never said anything during the shift change about a problem room and that she s been here for day actually and she shouldn t have to deal with this noise i say that i ll try to figure out which room it is and tell them to keep it down but if it not above a certain threshold there s not really much i or the cop can do so i go outside press my ear to the two door above her and while i can hear the tv and some people chatting in one room nothing in the other i don t hear wild monkey sex so i tell her that sorry there s nothing i can legally do if i can t hear it then it an acceptable noise level people are allowed to fuck in their room funnily enough she never asked for a room change and we re pretty open if there were problem already it seems like that would have been my bos s first go to she doe not take this well to the point where her scream in the parking lot are resulting in noise complaint from other room she bang hard on my locked door for a solid five minute and then start throwing the snowball at my manager s suite above the fd to try and wake him up and he s just worked a hr shift i ma let him sleep this doesn t work so she return to her room i call the cop they get here pretty much immediately they go talk to her and she start screaming at them when they come back they basically tell me that yeah she s completely unreasonable if you need u to evict her call u back it seems like she might have at least realized that she doesn t have any leverage here and ha so far stayed quiet but i am of course going to be fired because she spends a week to stay here and i rolled my eye once oof
used to work at an extended stay next to some big factory during the busy season for each company they would bring in worker from all over the country to come work these folk were mostly decent people but some of em were good old boy from the deep south who treated the time away from home a a free pas on their marriage oh i should also mention we are located in a very poor area on the outskirt of a major city so price are high to deter local from staying long enough to need to be evicted per local law the company are aware of this and pay a very generous per diem to cover rent first one a man come in asking if there are any room available i wa busy processing some payment so i didn t really look up until later we were currently booked except one unit but i had seen him on the camera drive a circle around the property park sit in his car for minute and then re park in a way that blocked three car from leaving sketchy so i vetted him before answering any of his question i asked him basic question like where he wa coming from local red flag i look up he is quite disheveled i ask him how long a long a i can red flag number i ask him where he work here and there red flag number three at this point he just start rambling because he know i know he s got no money and he s just trying to find a place to crash for a long a he can i am coming up with way in my head to tell him to get out when he start waving his hand around and i see in his hand he ha a green jet lighter and a meth pipe at this point i am scared and i know he ha le than to his name so i just tell him we have one spot and that it a night paid by the week up front he freak out for a bit asks for a job but then just accepts defeat and walk out sitting in his car for another few minute looking for the next place to go bother one of my favorite most of these guy were ruthless and didn t give a shit about customer service besides giving them what they needed no need for fake niceness in fact being nice usually made them try and walk all over you i came from a customer service background so it took me a few month to figure out being nice wasn t always the best way to calm down these guy anyways one day a guy we ll call jeff come in who is known for being a complete as while complaining about everything jeff come in gun blazing because someone put a note on his truck telling him he couldn t park in the street he said you need to find out who put that note on my truck and tell them to stay the f away from my truck because i am not parking in that spot i tell him that everyone got a notice today because the street wa blocked and the garbage truck couldn t make it to the dumpster everyone else ha abided by the notice and parked nicely in their spot even though they all also have nice big truck he say well i ve got a big truck make n model and it don t fit in your shitty little spot at this point i am done even trying to be nice so in a slightly condescending voice i say may i ask why do you need such a big truck fuming silence do you have a boat shake his head no do you have an rv no do you live on a farm lowering his head in shame no oh man so you have this big truck and you drive all the way across the country with it that must cost a fortune why don t you get a honda civic or a prius or something dude completely destroyed by this point he s stuttering totally flabbergasted someone would call him out like that i take a look at his account and notice that he hasn t paid in two week we were old school until i got hired and figured out our system can in fact take credit card so most customer still paid with cash or check he hand me a wad of cash and i ask him if he want me to find him a spot in our auxiliary lot or if he thought he could fit his truck in the spot he say i don t know i don t think it will fit i told him i could guide him in or show him how it done not that i wanted to try but at this point i wa just milking it he got his roommate to help him park and he never parked in the street again also from that point on he wa always very respectful when he came to the office i seriously think he needed that special treatment in order to see how big of a dick he wa being let me know if you want more

this is my first post and i thought i would tell about a real incident that happened to me a couple of week ago i wa able to write it down after i got home from work have taken some deep breath and had a soft drink at my elbow i wa at work i man the front line at a fast food establishment we can call it arewethereyet an elderly gentleman come in not moving easily and on oxygen i want to help him a best i can so i greet him with my best personal relation smile and ask what he would like to order he informs me that he ha a coupon for a twofer special but he left it in his car did he have to go back and get it i sadly and politely told him that we didn t have any coupon out right now the one that he wa thinking of had all expired a few week before and so were removed from the register a a side note we don t put in any price at all on the register we just hit the button for the item and it ha a price already on it when we have coupon or sale there s a separate button with the sale price on it once the sale is over the button is gone and so is the price anyway he irately told me that he did have the coupon and it wa good i tried to be polite and said maybe it wa a coupon from another area there are those from the same chain for different area and we do honor them but we have to see them to know what to ring up and then we keep the coupon to show what the open discount wa for he interrupted me a i tried to explain telling me that he wa from this area and he wa going to go to his car to get that coupon and shove it up my a that did it any wish to assist him just flew out of the window towing my temper close behind it at that point i just told him that he needed to leave right now that wa it i had had it when i saw that he wa coming back in i listened to the screaming in my mind that i needed to make sure i kept this job and didn t get in trouble so i let my manager deal with him i had told her while he left what he had said and how he d said it threateningly so she went to the front to meet with him i just decided that i would walk off to a different area of the restaurant while he wa there needle to say the coupon that he flashed in her face wa expired she pointed that out to him well you were right he said over bos s shoulder to me a i wa getting almost out of his sight no apology just a shrug of oh well he asked how much the regular price of the item were but didn t like the non coupon price so he left without ordering i wasn t sorry at all to see him go but these people had ruined my mood for several day
look like my na gonna be easy cause i m sold out can t sell no room without any freaking key literally scrambling to see if maybe there s some on the housekeeper cart i found good thing since i got reset coming in i m so over this it wouldn t be so bad if this wasn t the second time this ha happened since i ve been here my only other option is to go cry to one of the other hotel on the strip and pray they re merciful gonna have people checking in with key card from a different fking hotel and that s if i can get someone to give me some which probably ain t likely is it am yet i wanna go home edit omg crisis somewhat adverted just went into my maintenance shop and found a stack of but still this is ridiculous
have you guy ever noticed that when you have a hiccup with a guest during check in it is very likely that thing will continue to spiral out of control from there i mean that s not what we want we want to nip it in the bud and let the guest have a nice rest of their stay but no lady fate like to sh t on people in three it seems this past sunday wa literal ragnarok at my hotel valentine s weekend combined with multiple hockey team wa not a fun time for any department we had check out on sunday morning we are a room property and thing just went to hell from there not enough housekeeper breakfast area way over occupancy even though we opened up our meeting room to accommodate the rush the usual slew of late check out request etc well when i show up to pick up the piece on sunday night a the resident sun thur vampire my fd supervisor looked like she had been through the ringer apparently our exec housekeeper had been out of town this weekend so his supervisor wa working and she dropped like everything including all four of our studio queue very important client who is with u for the week and had reserved a studio because they have more room and a wet bar said client checked in with my supervisor all wa well before she came back down and calmly stated that somehow she had been given the wrong room type supervisor check log see that morning shift had changed her room type to a standard double queen and dropped the studio supervisor is panicking because she know who this woman is and all of the studio are dirty housekeeping is gone for the day but ala there is a handicap studio that wa available important client agreed that it would be fine take her new key and go up she call from the room le than five minute later the housekeeper had forgotten to put in the towel and soap for the bathroom and the woman wa understandably pissed at this point my supervisor apologizes and offer to bring up the item client decline and say she will be moved to a clean completed room supervisor pre inspects a smaller but still nice king studio and move the woman into it finally it s over spoiler alert it wasn t in an effort to nip this chaos storm in the bud my supervisor made a new dummy reservation to hold the handicapped studio for the important client the following day so that it would not be reserved by someone else she put a very concise note in our message system that all we have to do is change the room number and type in the existing reservation and move her the following day delete the dummy reservation and call it done well no my second shift is uh not an efficient kind of guy and that s being kind he blow past the note doesn t see it i assume and check her in to the new reservation which placed two authorization on her company card the old room wa even still checked in when i arrived my o ha a void authorization button thank god and i hammered it so hard when i saw what happened probably still going to hear about it in the morning but at this point someone want this poor lady shafted by the hotel cest la vie amp x b edit to everyone who is going to say that creating a dummy reservation seems like a weird way to hold a room i m sure our supervisor doesn t have access to our o that let s u block room or take them out of inventory so that s how we do it could this have been avoided oh yah totally
just happened i m still confused if this lady want a red carpet and giant neon arrow because our parking lot is not hard to find i work front desk at a museum day a week and i have never heard someone complain about our parking being hard to find we are right next to an airport with it s own giant parking lot but most people are smart enough to figure out the entrance to the lot with our giant sign beside it must be our lot right nah apparently this woman couldn t decide if it wa staff parking only or if it wa airport parking i don t know i wa just so astounded by her stupidity and mentioning we need a large green parking sign that i just shut my mouth and took her admission amp x b edit just asked me if we have a machine to pay for parking nope our parking is free accidental dumbass tax
edit so after reading your guy advice and getting more information from the hotel i have decided to file for wrongful dismissal thank you all for your advice and kind word so hey not sure this belongs here but it is a crazy tale from the front desk alright so to make a long story short my gm is interesting everyone i work with agrees try to buy your loyalty with expensive gift card food gift to make you do her dirty work aka write report outlining everything bad about your supervisor or coworker doe for example or make you clean her office or do her paperwork when it s clearly not in your job description so one day i said no to writing up a journal about my supervisor because hey i m not like that and all hell broke loose one morning a client tried to check in at am checkout are at and we were full house when it came to standard bed room i explained that to him and offered him a full price upgrade because i had always been told not to manually change price but he wouldn t budge i then offered to call him a soon a the room wa ready a well a ask for it to be done a quick a possible but he wanted it right this instant and said he wa gonna go to another hotel there wa nothing i could really say so i told him i wa sorry to see him go and that if he changed his mind i would be keeping his reservation active until pm check in time and then cancel it for free gm wa standing behind me for the whole conversation but did not say a word after he left she came out of her office and told me about how unacceptable my behaviour wa and la dee da well alright then i think and get on with my day at pm minute before my shift end i get called into her office and handed the paper that state that i wa fired without prior notice now i wa unionized so this shouldn t happen but she said that me turning the client away wa akin to stealing from the company so she had every right to fire me without prior notice my jaw dropped to the floor funny thing wa they already had a replacement trained and lined up to take my position the day after not to fall into crazy conspiracy theory here but i m starting to wonder if that wa even a real client to begin with so hey moral of the story is it s not just the guest that are insane thanks for the good story around here people it wa a fun ride but this event just marked the end of my tourism career if you guy are ever in a situation where you feel manipulated by your boss or where they ask you for impossible stuff dont be naive like me and take it a appreciation run
so our card reader ha been down for a few day now at our family owned restaurant some kind of network problem that the company is working on but not getting resolved very quickly currently we are only able to accept cash we have a sign posted on the front door and we do our best to mention it to people when they come in but we aren t perfect and sometimes forget this shouldn t be a big deal because we do have a sign posted at eye level in big letter but this lady came in i didn t seat her so i m not sure if she wa actually told about the cash only situation but i know she had to have seen the sign when the check come she try to pay with a card and we inform her again that we can only accept cash currently she get very angry about this and say she wa never told i understand that it s very annoying and inconvenient and it is entirely possible that she wa not verbally told about the problem but we have a very visible sign up on the front door we apologize for the miscommunication but do point out the sign and that s when she hit u with the you can t assume i read the sign you post again i understand that this is a big issue and very inconvenient but regardless i don t think it s unreasonable to expect people to read a sign plenty of other customer have and they either go get cash or don t come into the restaurant
what someone just called to ask me that i had no answer i ve never once turned one of those tv s on off all i could tell them wa it had one for sure and they had to find it they just huffed and slammed the phone down then condescendingly said on their way through the lobby that i should know more about my hotel legend ha it that karen ha yet to turn her tv on to this very day
hi guy so im and have been working part time for this restaurant for almost month now usually i would work day per week usually for about hour per day however recently my manager ha been scheduling me for only day a week and slashing my hour completely in half im worried have i been underperforming i havent been making serious mistake nor have i been late to work im not sure if it just me but my coworker who is filipino is always working day a week and hour per day a well no change my assumption might be that because my manager is filipino a well so im not sure if she s being biased towards my coworker because she like her more so she schedule her more hour im also confused a to why they wouldnt want to schedule me for more hour im a cheaper employee to schedule considering the fact that my other coworkers earn a little more than me because they have prior experience however this doesnt mean that i dont perform a well because of my lack of experience i make sure to do my job well every single day because i really enjoy doing it or it might also be due to the recent wuhan coronavirus so they re cutting employee hour just me unfortunately im okay with not earning the money from my hour but im not okay knowing that my schedule ha been slashed without a proper notice or reason could anyone comfort me or maybe tell me the possible reason why

hi guy it absolutely blow my mind that i m still dealing with idiot who smoke in a non smoking room hotel and expect to get away with it at my last property we accepted cash at check in this included a cash security deposit to cover any damage the room were accessible from the outside so if someone wanted to smoke they could easily open their door and step out we also had smoking room available believe it or not one morning a guest came to the desk ready to check out of a non smoking room a half naked woman presumably a stripper or escort of some kind requested the cash security deposit i excuse myself and proceed to inspect the room for any sign of damage missing item it s definitely smokey a half full water bottle with some black liquid floating in the bottom is on the dresser the half naked guest is now joined by her male companion at the front desk i can t give you your security deposit back someone smoked in the room rage ensues dispute after dispute excuse we just got back from the club wa my personal favorite the guy is a terrible liar he s not convincing and is fighting a grin while denying the smoking i explain that they ll have to speak with the manager regarding the deposit i present his business card the guy then proceeds to violently rake all of the item on the front desk onto the floor they storm out together but not before making a scene they call me a racist about time and tip our flower planter by the entrance spilling dirt everywhere poor innocent flower it s interesting that even though i ve upgraded to a much nicer hotel i m still dealing with shocked angry guest who deny smoking in their room it s so fucking obvious when someone ha smoked in a non smoking space even to me and i m a smoker i never smoke indoors because i don t want all my shit to smell i think a lazy dumbass fee should be applied in addition to the cleaning fee smoking in a smoke free space is inconsiderate and arrogant get off your as and walk outside
hello again from the night auditor in the middle of the wood tonight s story is a doozy it s time for the bison hunt where i am the one time of the year that native american hunter in my area are able to get wild bison legally and that s caused some interesting guest to come through mostly drunk people making walk in reservation at random time of day usually after the bar in town close or people coming to the desk every morning for a week to extend what wa originally a one night walk in i can usually deal with these guest herd them to their room and keep them out of the pool after hour but tonight i had an odd one this family of walked in during second shift and paid for their one night stay with cash nd shift didn t mention them to me a odd or anything but about half an hour into my shift i get a call that the tv in the room isn t working i walk across the property to try and figure out if i can fix it and the second i walk in i know these guy are gonna suck there are or firearm around the room they all smell like booze and they re clearly here for the hunt the son s never really acknowledge that i m there chatting in the corner while i talk with the father while trying to figure out what s wrong with the tv i try for about minute but am unable to figure out just what is wrong with it i let the father know that i can see if another room is available on the ground floor to move them to but if i can t i ll take something off the stay thinking like of course there s nothing else on the ground floor and my hotel doesn t have elevator one of his son need a mobility aid and is obviously unable to use stair i ask him what he s thinking is appropriate compensation for the tv issue and he flat out say i m not authorized to give anything above the total stay and i let him know that it s fine luckily and i give him the cash back a he s about to leave he turn back and tell me that by the way his son is ex military a veteran even and explains to me what happened to cause his needing a mobility aid ok still not authorized to give you further compensation without manager approval he go on to tell me that his son think that someone tried to break into their room to steal their firearm a there are dent in the door most of the door around here have dent in the door since this place wa built in the s and i don t think the door have been replaced since the day it opened so i m not surprised that there are dent in the door he let me know that his son is really worried that someone saw them bring their firearm in and want to steal them i try to assure the father that it s a small town the last person who got arrested wa month ago for a duo we don t really have property crime he seems to accept that but keep reminding me his son is a disabled veteran and worried about their gun at this point i feel strongly that he s trying to intimidate me into giving him further compensation but i blow it off stand my ground and let him know that i will bring up the concern with my manager and i will find out if we have security camera in that section of that building i know there aren t with this he seems to realize that i m not going to budge tonight and return to his room tl dr a guest try to turn a tv issue into a potential burglary concern and try to get more money back from me try to guilt and possibly intimidate me by continually bringing up that his son is a veteran and the group ha firearm am i overreacting or am i right to feel that this guest wa trying to intimidate me i m planning on mentioning it to my manager when he come in to relieve me in the morning but is it even worth worrying him about
a above that is just a moronic mindset when you use that number a your contact when making travel plan my hotel doe not have a hour front desk so when reception close and the door lock at pm other arrangement have to be made we ask everyone for an eta and any reservation without an eta automatically get an email sent to them day before arrival requesting one and advising that alternate check in arrangement need to be made if they aren t arriving during office hour this particular guest listed eta of which is our check in time by he hasn t arrived and i phoned the mobile number he s supplied on booking no answer i leave a voicemail in the next three hour i phone time and leave two more voicemail no answer no call back it s closing time his booking is prepaid so i process a incidental guarantee preauth to his booking credit card and put a key in a keysafe and email him the key collection info and let the gm know just in case he get an after hour call if the guest doesn t check his email gm phone the guest from home number withheld about this guy finally answer he tell gm he doesn t answer call from number he doesn t recognise and let the manager know he s not coming and want to cancel for a refund idiot is told there won t be a refund manager tell me to leave key out in the safe box just in case he later decides to turn up had this clown actually answered the phone when i tried earlier i would have known he wasn t coming and wouldn t have processed the preauth which will now be pending on his account for a week had he answered when i first called then i could have had the opportunity to try to resell the room in which case i could have refunded him the accommodation charge from booking but he didn t answer the phone so lost the room rate in what can be considered an idiot tax lady and gentleman and anyone in between please reconsider if you have the i don t answer call from number i don t recognise policy especially if you use that number a a contact for company you have business with it could save you money and hassle edit to add from the comment below it look like the u ha some pretty underwhelming telemarketing law i m not in the u and this guy should add his number to our government s do not call register if telemarketers are his worry
i work a a cashier waiter at a privately owned fast food place that ha aspiration of being an a la carte restaurant the owner really doesn t understand where most of the sale come from i e drunk just wanting to stuff their face since i only work during busy night mostly fri sat and sat sun i see a fair share of drunken stupidity but last fri sat wa something special what follows are the highlight i m handling the cash register and the table while my friend colleague handle the food this is how we usually divide duty since she doesn t want to deal with the customer and i don t want to deal with oven and fryer generally speaking it s a quiet night but then a bit before a m shit start flying at the fan and our card reader go on the frizz no transaction will go through great while that s out of commission i have to ask every customer if they re able pay with cash or not most are fine with the request and either produce cash or pop out to the nearest atm then in stumble drunk who apart from just being generally incoherent want to order a dish we don t serve a variety platter that a local bar serf i tell him we don t have that dish local bar ha it we can make part of the variety dish but we can t recreate it i ask him if he want the portion of the dish that we can make and he appears to want it when i further explain that he ll have to pay with cash because the card reader isn t working he dig up the portion we could do would ve been around it s a big platter i tell him that he need more to which he essentially toss the at my colleague and storm off colleague try to call him back to take his money but he either doesn t hear or care one of our regular see this and is ready to vouch for u that we tried to give the back ah well the go in our tip jar note in my country tip are not required expected next come a regular belligerent dolt half of the time bd is fine but other time he s picking fight with other people in line when i inform bd and his friend that they ll have to pay with cash and that we can t start making their order before they re paid bd cuss colleague and i out claiming he brings so much money into this place like buddy even if you were one of our nice regular we still wouldn t make your order before you paid you re usually just too drunk to realize that fact bd and co go to the atm and eventually pay while bd continues to whine their combined order wa around so yeah no way were we going to risk a no show by making the order before hand then there s a middle aged couple who clearly didn t read the menu properly but that s not a surprise frankly the set up of our menu is confusing when it s finally a m and we re ready to close colleague tell me that a customer is sleeping in one of the table we try to wake her up but she barely reacting so i call emergency service so that they can either send the cop or the emts over while waiting for the ambulance i have to monitor her breathing so i can t get cleanup started on time at this point colleague is still finishing the last order to go while the emts show up and help her out another customer drunk is passed out drunk leaning against a side table both colleague and i order him to leave but no dice guy s not budging though he is reacting colleague is lucky enough to flag down a cop car driving by so eventually drunk get escorted out once all the order are done and all the customer are out colleague and i proceed to groan and be baffled at the last few hour we had it took u till to clean the place up since the horde of distraction kept u away from prepping the cleanup like we usually would oh and both drunk and belligerent dolt showed up the next night and didn t say a word of the previous night s event colleague and i came to the conclusion that either they were too drunk to remember or too embarrassed to bring their issue back up yeah not the most dramatic of story but i really wanted to vent moral of the story always have a bit of cash on hand

i noticed this while reading another post on this subreddit background i ve been a waiter for about year now and although i m rather extroverted i m also relatively awkward when meeting new people so basically all the time at work to help fight the inevitable awkwardness i use the same dialogue for all my table and switch it up every so often to keep it fresh is this a common thing
so we recently rolled out toast a new to u compy po system it s fine we had aloha which is great but the owner is super cheap and didn t like the monthly fee associated with it a they decided to roll it out on u february th with no training and the manager daughter wa sick so no help there valentine s wa stupid b the owner is also super distrustful so no one ha manager code and of course we re making ton of mistake because wtf and trying to track her down to fix something which she always kinda question she s actually been a little better suck c some old folk have literally thought i m fucking around on my phone while taking their order on the handheld which is about the size of a brick i have to say hi folk this is our new system so bear with me while i ring your order in so they get it through their head that no i m not playing fucking candy crush while they order their chicken fried steak d the one bright spot i ve found that taking payment on the handhelds where they sign and choose other on the pad ha helped raise my tip percentage quite a bit my section is the family side of the restaurant so large family and old people who generally don t tip well and apparently their math skill suck so i ve definitely seen a jump there anyway that s my story edit i m curious how you all that use the hand helds handle presenting it for payment i m old school and don t want to linger while they tip i try to never impose my presence when people are tipping but we only have two hand helds so i can t leave it for long so far my method ha been present a paper receipt in a check presenter and when i see a card run it at the table briefly explain how they use it and walk away until they re done i mean i guess that s the way just curious how you guy do
i would like to preface this by apologizing for how mean this sound while simultaneously trying to explain why i have lost all will to care about this person to give minimum detail he ha a disability that he will use to manipulate those around him into pity more on this later for the past year and even before i wa at this property a man i will simply call cr cheap room ha been coming to our property tonight i finally had enough and even asked for a ban on him because it ha become a nuisance to everyone working front desk a well a the people he involved in trying to get his room to start with we used to throw him a bone and give him a room for a night our average rate is anything from on a weekday rate to on a weekend during the summer even our employee discount will only get u down to about this went on for about or month until summer started when we had to start refusing him such a low rate we would instead give him a discounted rate of on weekend most of this time he could not pay or would have some excuse to pay at a later date if this wa set up by people that have known and trusted him i could see that working this is a place of business however so we require payment from everyone on the day they check out unless it is paid in cash which we require up front on top of him only using cash and being given chance to pay after his night wa over we also waived the incidental our hotel collect on all cash payment in the last month however we have had a rash of people abusing the system and have made it so we are not allowed to make any exception cue where the problem start getting out of hand cr will come in one night and say he ha a friend who will pay before asking what the total amount will be he ha to write all this down due to having a hearing and speech disability i will always write down the total room cost then add incidental deposit for cash payment he usually won t return with the money when this happens other time cr will have an interpreter call and she he will say something along the line of i wa told i could stay there for again he know this isn t true and the entirety of the front desk staff have told him a much what he is doing here is using a go between to try and get u to say yes because talking to him through another person he is holding hostage a his interpreter is supposed to guilt u into a cheaper price i know this is his tactic because his so called friend with the money will sometimes call u and explain how they will pay for his room because we said we could let him stay for cheaper we have found out that cr ha been conning innocent people into paying for his room at multiple hotel we have taken to asking if they just met him over the phone and then explaining the situation to the person this ha cut down on the amount of people that will call u on his behalf save for the interpreter now all of this aside the thing that irritates me the most is that he will come in up to time a week on my shift and say and write that he ha between and just need a place to rest for always strangely hour no shower no nothing just a place to rest this is not how a business work and i finally told him that tonight a usual when he is told no he come up with an excuse a to why he need to rest in the lobby or the restroom this time his excuse wa because his doctor told him he need to rest his leg or he could die other excuse involve being tired burger king kicked him out he promise to be quiet etc most of these are small and valid excuse except that over the course of a year he will have a new one each time there come a point when it is being used by him so he can sleep inside instead of outside a more recent tactic of cr ha been to acknowledge not being able to stay then go to use our restroom for minute after the first time i started coming by after and listening he is on his tablet relaxing and goofing off whether he is texting or playing a game i don t know it doesn t take much to realize that he isn t using the restroom after minute on top of all this i do know he ha been trespassed off of multiple property by police a well a being banned from a good of the surrounding area i am not the only one who ha dealt with cr nor do i suspect i will be the last anyways this ha turned more into a rant than anything but i figure someone else might have a similar story involving someone homeless or disabled that con others using their disability on a side note i will give him credit for playing with the card he wa dealt i feel he could have done it in a kinder way but at least he isn t letting it get him down
in july i started serving at the restaurant i ve been greeter at for the past four year i ve seen drama go down in the back but never have i really been involved in it until this past thursday i ve debated sharing the experience but now that i look back on it it s fucking great i wa a greeter that night i do this occasionally if they really need someone a party of ten come in for a birthday party and they have a cake the size of a small rectangle table i asked them where they got it and they told me after that we got the manager to put it in our cooler until they were ready to cut it pretty normal so far the closing manager made a joke about how everyone need to watch me because i might steal a piece this manager make joke all the time he s a great guy so this wasn t the problem it wa one of the server taking care of the party after they had eaten almost all of the cake i went to clean a table next to them and they asked if i wanted the last piece i made sure they were okay with giving it to me and they said yes so i got to take a pretty big sized piece of cake home with me i m packing it up and one of the server came up to me scoffed and said ugh the greeter getting a piece of their cake but not the server that took care of them that s ridiculous i even offer to cut it in half for her to be nice but she just walked away so then i went home a little tense but that s all fast forward to saturday and i m at my serving shift my gm approach me and asks if i wouldn t leave a party alone for their cake of course i say no because well yeah that s not what happened that s what i thought she tell me before walking away at this point i m almost in tear because i m so angry why would the party call and report me about something that isn t true later that day i find out that the server who wa all pissy about me getting cake wa the one to report me the guest didn t even call or say anything to anybody the thursday closing manager wa there on saturday so he told me what happened when i left the server kept on raving about how i wa harassing those guest and that i m selfish and shit like that she then reported me to our gm just her the other server didn t say anything in the word of that manager she wa just jealous because you were offered a piece and she wasn t we worked together a few day ago after this incident blew over she wa nicer to me than normal probably because she knew she wa in the wrong i still work there for now but at least i can trust my management team to believe me when someone accuses me of something outside of my character i m eating that piece of cake with pride tl dr server report me for stealing cake from guest manager take up for me cake is good

for once i bring a story not about a guest but about a coworker well a collection of story really so this coworker who we ll call susan is an older but not exactly old lady and she s the kind of person who ain t gonna make it a secret how she feel about someone at least not to everyone else she ll be perfectly cordial to your face this mean she complains about management over even the most menial thing all the time to anyone who will listen one weekend we sold out completely susan wa asked to make housekeeping board because our head housekeeper hhk wa going to be late she made them including giving hhk her own board of ish room our agm ended up telling her not to worry too much about her board and to focus on her head housekeeper duty of checking every room for the next week susan bitched and bitched about how hhk didn t clean her room s she wa here until five how could she not get them done me i heard it wa because agm told her not to worry about it s well that wa stupid on agm s part there wa also a situation that wa admittedly a little eyeroll inducing but not nearly a bad a she made it out to be we had a high tier member guest who had been given a comp upgrade to a king suite come to the desk tl dr of his request he wa here for a month for work and his wife and kid were coming up on the weekend to see him he wanted a room with a bathtub in our hotel that would have to be a double for the kid to use nbd we get him switched and he head out the annoying part he came right back and said actually i didn t think about it at the time but the suite ha that wall that make it like there s separate room i think the extra privacy will help me sleep while the kid are here sorry can i move back i asked if he d moved anything into the new room yet and he say no he d just gone in to check it out great we don t even have to mark the room dirty but i m off the clock at this point so i go get susan susan proceeds to roll her eye in the most dramatic fashion possible before going to the desk to help the guy our computer system ha u type in the reason for a room move her reason dumbass in all cap i thought maybe she wa typing it out of frustration and would delete it and put something legit but nope she just hit enter and proceeds a normal my jaw dropped i immediately walked away and texted my manager apparently while i wa gone she couldn t figure out how to give the guy his previous extended stay rate in his king suite so instead of referring him to management she just said sorry you re stuck with that new room he ended up checking out twenty four day early tl dr coworker is a bitch called a guest a dumbass and tried to tell him he wa sol instead of accommodating an easy if stupid request lost the hotel thousand of dollar also ha a tendency to shit talk management which isn t sitting well with anyone management is trying to get rid of her but she ha a lot of tenure here so it s proving difficult oof
i have worked at this hotel for about month the comfort able hotel i started out in housekeeping and the owner quickly moved me to breakfast and then to front desk i have worked both morning and evening shift on the same schedule and it s very common for me to work a shift go home and then come back hour later to work a you can imagine this doe not leave much time to sleep once o clock out drive home get changed and finally wind down so all of the other staff know to give me a little extra space when i first get there because the turn and burn shift leave me slightly le chipper until i ve been up a couple hour anyway today wa one of those turn and burn night i had been at work about minute when i got a call from a certain booking site they were calling on behalf of a guest who wa a no show three night ago wanting to see if we could refund the stay usually we are willing to work with our travel partner so i ask why the rep then tell me that the guest decided not to stay there because we are not pet friendly remember i m borderline sleep deprived at this point i have two problem with this claim but i kindly tell the rep that i have no authority to make these decision i m just the front desk girl no fancy title on my name tag and that i will speak with the manager when he come in the rep kindly said thank you and that he would be emailing me the request and and can continue communicating that way sound great now my two issue with this refund request you waited until three day after your stay to begin the process let s say you booked a hotel then found out they aren t pet friendly and you book another hotel room wouldn t you immediately start the process of getting the first reservation canceled why wait until after the stay wa to be completed the website say right on it that we are not pet friendly therefore you want me to process a refund because you are too stupid to read the page not today buddy so my manager come in about by then i had received the email i presented him with the email and the webpage showing that this wasn t a surprise rule that she couldn t have known about he agreed with me and denied the refund i m not gonna lie i took a lot of pleasure typing up that refusal email sorry if this wa too long boring it s my first post
so this just happened three airline crew member jump on our hotel s shuttle by mistake the lady approach and i ask how i may help she start announcing a name to me i don t understand her and ask for a repeat which she then start to repeat repetitively and louder each time i stop her and tell her that her telling me that over and over isn t helping is there a name i can look up she start to do that offended laugh thing you know the one then turn to the other two and back to me and say no one s ever asked for our name before we usually just sign a form and it s done do you not have the form just then the male of the trio pipe up and say this is the hotel on that street isn t it um no this is the hotel on this street that hotel is in another part of town about minute from here a chorus of ooooohs fill the air and then the inevitable question of well can your shuttle take u there wa asked and it wa answered with a satisfying no well how will we get there he pondered aloud and apparently at me you ll have to call their hotel and have them to pick you up from here i guess that wa just too far fetched of a notion to him because my answer wa met with a this is ridiculous response and he wa right it wa ridiculous it s ridiculous that you would just jump on random hotel shuttle and not make sure it s the correct one going to the correct address guess what our shuttle driver know the address so they would have been able to tell you yes or nah bruh our shuttle do not run hour and you just happened to have had jumped on the last one that evening i didn t like the vibe the whole undertone that this wa somehow my fault you understand the whole this is ridiculous wa uncalled for what s ridiculous your behavior and tantrum because that really is the only thing that is ridiculous at this precise moment that and the lady saying the name of the company who booked them on a loop increasing the volume each go around that s what wa ridiculous to me when i look back on the situation after that i left them to their own device i let them sit inside because why exacerbate an already tense moment with telling them to wait outside but i didn t offer them any courtesy or ask them how contacting the hotel went because i heard the guy made sure i heard i walked to the back office to watched them from the security monitor when the guy and one of the other lady got up and walked outside the screecher wa still sitting and i decided to walk out and ask if everything went okay with the other hotel she tell me it did and that they are just tired but hopefully all will work out i told her good night and out she walked the entitlement we re tired so that s why were were dick to you when you think about airline attendant worker and hotel employee are essentially in the same business hospitality their place of work just happens to be several thousand mile above ground this doesn t make them any better than me standing behind a desk so if anyone from a flight crew is reading this get that mile high stick out of your as and act with some civility the next time your company put you up in a hotel take responsibility just a you would want your guest on your flight to take responsibility for their action amp x b not several thousand mile but foot they fly all over and rack up thousand of air mile i combined a dual thought thanks for pointing out my mistype
i serve at a fairly popular hour restaurant in a small town one of the only place open hour so it get fairly busy around pm after everything else close i worked the night shift usually there are at least server and one cook sometimes server and cook on my shift saturday night is a very popular night at work because everyone is drinking and coming out to eat and we re one of the three place open i wa scheduled yesterday saturday with another girl who is unreliable when i saw the schedule i actually groaned because i knew she wouldn t come in but i figured they would call someone else in since it s our busiest night i wa wrong i ve only been there a couple of month the cook they had working wa great though when she found out the other girl had no call no showed she wa livid when they weren t sending another server to help me she wa more livid a the shift started she pulled me aside and told me to just focus on what s in front of me and if there are time she ha a moment of rest in the kitchen she will come out and try to help me a much a she can it wa hellacious people came in one right after another i did a much a i could to get table cleared off in time a it always seems to be the case though they never wanted to sit at a table i d already cleaned they scope out dirty one and then sat impatiently waiting for me to clear them off i kept thinking please don t let anyone else come in until i ve got every table cleaned but i wouldn t get my request until am at everyone wa cleared out table were cleared cook wa handing me a pile of cash she grabbed when helping me clear of table everything wa okay for a second i stepped outside to smoke after all table were set up for the breakfast rush we anticipated would hit in about minute to an hour cook really helped my self esteem i thought i wa sinking all night but when i came back in she told me i handled it better than any other server she d seen in similar position i don t know if she wa just being nice because i wa having a hard night but it helped luckily we didn t have a morning rush like normal just a steady trickle of one of two people at a time mostly regular so we were able to get our side work mostly done by the time first shift rolled in i managed to roll out only minute late with a decent amount of tip in my pocket i lived but if they ever schedule me with that server again especially on a saturday night i might lose my mind

hello friend on mobile so sorry for formatting this might not be the most exciting story but i think it s a fun one i work at a luxury hotel in southern california that see a lot of large group i am the group reservation coordinator and i just happen to stumble upon a problem guest the back story about a year ago we had a large group take up about of the hotel at this time i wa at the front desk and they were not an easy group lot of random request and entitled people the group came and went and in my mind it wa over however they had one attendee who wa also responsible for paying the hotel at the end of their program they owed the hotel about k our accounting team did everything they could to get them to pay they worked out a payment plan but eventually they stopped responding to out email and call the remaining balance wa about k the hotel pretty much wrote it off and d the group fast forward to this past monday i get an email from an admin of someone attending a conference from a separate group at the hotel next month this program contracted their room to be non refundable once their attendee made the reservation so we have gotten a few people who have had to cancel and are allowing other people to take over the reservation the admin say that they want to provide a new credit card for a reservation so that a new attendee can take over a reservation now we have to send a cc authorization for this over email the admin is reluctant and say he would rather just do it over the phone i let him know we have to use the authorization form and i don t hear from him for about a week i finally get an email that say he filled out the authorization and asks for confirmation i call the accounting team to make sure it s ok and the lady ha a long pause she asks me how this person made reservation i let her know it wa a name change and they were changing the payment method she informs me of how he ghosted u and say she ha to talk to the accounting director we just got a new gm and turn out this guest also did not pay his last property for k that s not a typo so to wrap this up out do is trying to get payment from this guy or we are going to inform the group that this particular guest is not welcome on property

on mobile sorry if this suck to read this happened yesterday sunday afternoon so typical post church crowd shenanigan this one table seemed very nice except for the dad off the bat he wa demanding to know specific price and ingredient that he would have found just looking at the menu anyway they get their food go great i check on them like twice cause the dad seemed to dislike when i wa the table at the end i give them their bill and that s when it go downhill the dad show me the bottom of his cup is chipped and begin to go on and on about how he just had stitch put on his finger and it could have cut him and injured him and how his oldest son who wa very quiet and nice wa autistic and could have hurt himself with the bottom of the dad s cup ok bear in mind our cup are a plastic material not glass and yes it wa chipped but wouldn t injure you unless you intentionally pressed it against your skin i just sighed and brought over the gm who offered him some free appetizer coupon wasn t good enough for him apparently so my pushover manager took off an additional the guy finally paid and left leaving me on the table bill wa like honestly the thing that upset me the most is him using his disabled son a a way to get free food i hate sunday
so i am working the and sometimes we charge the credit card for non refundable booking on the day of arrival if we didn t notice the booking wa an advanced purchase when it wa made anyway some lady called saying the wife of the person who wa supposed to stay died and they wanna cancel the reservation and get a refund i calmly explain our policy fully expecting them to insist on getting a refund but they just say ok fair enough and put the phone down if they had insisted and explained what happened i might have agreed to a free cancellation but i wa just surprised when they put the phone down now i feel very bad and like they must think i m heartless and they will go online and leave a bad review saying we didn t cancel their room even if the person died the thing is i have heard every reason under the sun a to why someone want a refund on a non refundable rate and my go to response is always to say that our policy is what it is am i an asshole
on mobile so i apologize for any formatting issue first post on here a well but damn i need to vent i work at a nice restaurant that specializes in fresh food and great cocktail when i wa hired they made a great deal about how their dress code wa relaxed and all about how they want their employee to be able to have their individuality sound great right it wa one of the highlight of this job to me especially since the past few i ve had have had strict dress code fast forward a few month and management spring on u that we ll be wearing apron right no big deal to me i don t mind being protected from random food and accept that paying for an apron is unavoidable however they neglected to tell u that we would also be severely altering dress code i have bought nice clothes only for the purpose of using them to go to work and now most if not all are not allowed i don t think it s right to hire someone with the promise of one thing and then turn around and do the exact opposite i understand that business change and that you just have to roll with it but i m not financially in a place where i can just go out and buy a whole new wardrobe especially since i already have for this job not to mention in the decade they ve been open nothing like this ha happened it just feel like i ve been blindsided and there is not shit i can do about it i wa finally starting to enjoy this job a well so it suck that this all happened guess it s time to suck it up buttercup and either roll with the punch or figure something else out thanks for reading my rant

i suggested a guest who wa traveling w x and trailer to park closer to where we have our trucker and uhaul s park and i got looked at a if i suggested they sleep in their truck bed by the way the wife glared at me and began to negotiate after i said that and then when the husband got word he completely undermined everything i wa saying and insisted since it pretty empty in the lot it wa pm check in started an hour ago and since we aren t sold out that they are fine to park where they want and i literally just said um ok because if i didn t it would have escalated into something i didn t have the energy for plus i needed to help other guest who were just if not more entitled a guest luckily we were only at about of a full house so it wa fine but i have never been so undermined in my life the entitlement is real and these folk are usually very pleasant so it just screw with my very passive mind that a soon a they cant have their way they want to cause a commotion
hi all context i am a waitress in a hotel in australia we are paid hourly and tipping is not customary we rely very heavily on employer to do the right thing legally and according to our workplace regulation we must have a break hour into our shift any time worked past this hour deadline without a break add an increase onto our hourly rate manager will always adjust our time sheet to have our break hour into the shift even if we didn t go on break at that time or didn t have a break at all i know it is not always realistic to have your break within this deadline however they are really taking advantage of u because it happens often and we are never compensated i have probably never received an accurate payslip it isn t a huge amount of money but it s still upsetting that they really don t care about u only their target and kpis i have reason to believe that the general manager of the hotel is aware a well a all subordinate who run the various food outlet in the hotel can i go against them i want to make a stand but don t know how and if i even should interesting note an executive at my workplace wa a floor manager at a certain australian fine dining chain that currently are being investigated for wage theft of million dollar million usd if prosecuted it will be one of the largest incident of wage theft ever in this country he talk about his time at this restaurant with great fondness hmmmm
so a man come in with a reservation from a third party site since it s after audit he ha to wait a i reinstate the reservation then the ball get rolling the total is more than he booked for he say that he had it cheaper i explain that the site doesn t include the tax and incidental charge then he say that he ha the room paid for no no you do not considering there is that billing still on the screen but i play along and explain that he still need to pay the incidental a well a have a card on file to use he grumble and wait a i get the payment set up and the card go through i didn t do it the exact way i wa supposed to the usual route wa being dodgy so i had to nav around it which is a pain when both party are tired and not willing to put up with bullshit but the card is on file a should be the balance is paid and he think he s going to get a receipt no no you won t that s against policy and i won t have to deal with it tomorrow night i don t know if he wa trying to outsmart me but there s only one instance where that would be true and this wasn t it i d have known if he had paid for the room beforehand that pc doesn t lie so while tps do pay for room and tax they hadn t paid at that time so perhaps it wa a late charge don t know why it wa over an hour before the guest had checked in and if they didn t pay by that time not a whole lot i can do take it up with the company not me lol
i ve been hanging out here for a while but this is my first post for context i m a waitress in the dining room of an independent living retirement facility i ve worked there for three and a half year now which mean that i m the server with the most experience this will be relevant amp x b tldr at the bottom amp x b player me little old me m former manager he wa my manager at the time that this took place o other server g the aforementioned gluten free gremlin gm the gremlin s mother c chef amp x b so at this retirement community we do tour for people who are inquiring about moving into the facility the people touring are often accompanied by their child a a part of this tour they are invited to have lunch in our dining room because i have the most experience at this place i end up taking most of the tour in order to make sure they get the best service because we want these people to move into the facility amp x b so the marketing director brings in the tour in the middle of lunch service it wa a pretty slow day so i wa in a really good mood and i wa almost finished with the two other table that had been in my section i also generally enjoyed serving the tour because usually they were lovely more polite than most of the actual resident that wa for sure amp x b not these people amp x b we get them sat down with menu and i bring them water i do the standard hi my name s me and i ll be your server today can i get you two anything else to drink today etc amp x b and right off the bat i can tell that g is going to be a problem she looked me dead in the eye and said where is your gluten free menu amp x b me i m sorry i don t believe we have one i can certainly go speak to our chef though to determine which item are gluten free note i ve worked in restaurant for a while and had had a long term boyfriend with celiac s so i wa pretty familiar with what gluten free meant amp x b g in the snarkiest way you can imagine well that sound like more of a hassle than it s worth why don t you have a gluten free menu amp x b me heartrate rising because i could smell the karen on this woman to my knowledge we haven t had more than one or two gluten free resident in the past few year i don t think that my manager have ever felt that a gluten free menu wa necessary given that fact amp x b g now speaking a though i m about year old well now i don t think that s quite true especially in today s day and age everyone s got something amp x b side note calling me a liar is the easiest way to get on my bad side i know this dining room like the back of my hand i know each and every resident that eats in my dining room and i know if they have any restriction because dining restriction show up in our po i m also not stupid amp x b other side note perhaps in today s day and age everyone doe have something however recall that the age group that i serve in my dining room is like anywhere from to year old in that generation very few people have got something amp x b me trying to keep calm because these are guest like i said earlier i can certainly go check with the chef for you to figure out what your mom can eat amp x b and at that point that s all i could do i don t know the in and out of every recipe on the menu i don t work in the kitchen so while i could have taken a pretty good guess it wouldn t be perfect amp x b g with the most patronizing smile acid in her voice okay clearly you re not understanding what gluten free mean it depends on the way that the food is cooked and so we can t just go through the menu item by item in order to determine what is or isn t gluten free so why don t you do your job and tell me what on this menu my mother can eat amp x b i have never bitten my tongue that hard in my life i swear i saw red i could feel myself growing closer and closer to tear and i knew that i needed to get away from them amp x b me forcing a smile well i ll go talk to the chef and see what we can do for you okay amp x b i walked away from that table a quickly a i could a soon a i got back to the kitchen i went and found m i told him that i needed someone else to take that table and that i wa no longer going to be serving them because i would not deal with someone who talked to me like that amp x b one of the other server o heard me half cry half speaking and offered to take the table she spoke to the chef then went out in the dining room and allegedly the following interaction took place i wa in the break room trying to calm down amp x b o hi my name is o and there are a couple of thing we can arrange that are gluten free amp x b g oh finally someone who know what they re talking about hopefully you re more competent than that other girl amp x b o i apologize if you felt that way about your other server however we don t have a lot of experience serving gluten free guest a we haven t had that many in the past amp x b g progressively more furious and condescending you know what i take back what i said clearly you and your coworkers have no idea what gluten free mean or how many people it affect there are so many people who can t have gluten i can t imagine that you ve never had one here and like i explained to that other girl we can t just look at the menu and decide what s gluten free it ha to be prepared in a special way amp x b o didn t say anything else before she walked away m wa the next victim of the table and g pulled him aside to chew him out about how awful his server are amp x b side note when i say pulled him aside i mean she pulled him away from the table into the middle of the dining room within earshot of every server and the remaining resident in the dining room amp x b g spent about minute informing m about how awful service had been how terribly she and her mother had been treated and how incompetent me and o were she didn t understand this generation referring to o and i and by extension almost every other server in the place could be so lazy and useless amp x b now something to know is that m wa fiercely protective of his team we were for all intent and purpose a very tight knit family and he wa everyone s work dad furthermore he had the worst temper of anyone that i ve ever met maybe i ll make another post about him sometime amp x b m stormed back into the kitchen with literal steam coming out of his ear also cry at this point c volunteered to take the table funnily enough g wa perfectly pleasant to c because she knew he d be the one making her food amp x b when c came back to the kitchen he informed u that gm had several other dietary restriction that we hadn t been informed about she couldn t eat pork or fish or beef she couldn t eat green vegetable no gluten no seasoning this resulted in the blandest looking dish i had ever seen if i recall correctly it wa a plainer than plain chicken breast with a side of carrot or something amp x b furthermore i later came to find out that g had made snide comment to c about how useless and incompetent the staff were if there wa one person who wa more protective of u server than m it wa c he had been in the industry for decade and had owned several restaurant and understood the importance of having a positive relationship between boh and foh he also had a temper amp x b g continued to chew out the dining room staff for the rest of her tour i only know this because our dining room manager m s bos pulled me aside to ask what happened because the marketing director had gotten an earful from g and marketing had gone to the dining room manager about it amp x b thankfully gm did not move into the facility and nothing else every came of this fiasco it wa however the most emotionally trying shift of my life i had taken a lot of shit from the resident they were old and entitled and didn t understand that we had multiple people to serve at once but the way that this woman spoke to me broke me inside amp x b i know this isn t nearly a bad a what many people in this sub have experienced but it wa something i felt fit here pretty nicely thought i might share amp x b cheer amp x b tldr gluten free gremlin kick up a fuss about u not having a gluten free menu make two server and a manager cry
