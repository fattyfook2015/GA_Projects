1,,TalesFromYourServer,"I've been serving for a few years, work at a sports bar/bowling alley hybrid now and for some things it's easier to just let the customer have their way. For situations like with our drinks ($4), or in this case, our $10 cover charge for UFC.

So this night, I finally get my first table, a couple hours after the fights have started. They already have drinks and some food, so I ask if they were bowling or in the arcade before they were sat (no cover charge in those areas because UFC isn't shown there). Nope, they were playing pool. No sweat.

So I ask if the server they had already charged them, and one girl claims they were never even told. So I explain it's $10, and that's when she makes the mistake of telling me she's not paying it *because* she wasn't told.

Again, to reiterate, normally I'd just let it slide, just ""forget"" to charge them, but if someone wants to tell me how things are gonna go, they can fuck right off.

Me: ""I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I have to charge you.""
Her: ""I'm not paying it.""
Me: ""If you're not paying then I can't let you sit here.""
Her: ""Well I don't even want to watch the fight.""
M: ""We have other tables outside the restaurant that don't have cover charge if you'd like.""
H: ""Well why do you guys put it on every TV if there are people who don't want to watch it?""

6,,TalesFromYourServer,"Alright there’s a TL;DR at the bottom, i’m on mobile, be warned if you don’t like swearing, yadda yadda here’s what happened.

There’s a rather old guy (I’ll call him Dave) that comes into (about once a week) the small local restaurant I host at. He is usually polite for a few minutes before he starts to break out dirty jokes with the servers, bussers, and of course me and the other hosts. He can become really vulgar sometimes but we all just smile and nod and be as polite as possible because he is a “regular paying customer” and “just some old man that doesn’t know better.”

This guy loves to distract us all and talk to us for AGES while we are working. Wether he is showing us tik toks/facebook memes on his phone or just telling us vulgar jokes, he loves to chat and it can be incredibly hard to get away from this guy politely once he decides he wants to talk to you.

Now maybe the guy is just lonely, and his excessive talking is not a problem when we are slow or the person he is speaking to is an adult, but there are times when this guy REALLY tests my patience. I may be an asshole for my feelings towards the guy since he’s just some lonely old dude, but I digress. 

I was annoyed when he made disgusting jokes along the lines of “eating out women” to a 16 year old busser, but it was brushed off as the busser does look older than she really is and he is just trying to talk right? We were slow at the time anyways so it didn’t matter. 

But that same night, whitest he had decided to eat chips and drink soda in front of the TV and a sports game for an hour and a half later, we really got busy. People started filling in fast and pretty soon there was a short wait time for tables. 

Of course, when I am the busiest I would be that night, he decides to leave. Which is fine, he just has to wait in line. 

Keep in mind the space at the front of the restaurant is small and cramped with people in line to pay and people waiting to be seated.

Dave makes it to the front of the line and starts to just *GO OFF*. He is telling me dad jokes left and right and won’t give me his bill so I can ring up his order and charge him. The people behind him are starting to groan, and I am doing my best to smile and politely get his shit taken care of. 

I finally get ahold of his bill after what seems like ages and ring up his order, but instead of giving me his card he says he has to show me a “few facebook memes!” instead. I politely say “Sir I apologize but I will have to see it next week as theres a line.” 

It is as if I never said anything at all. He shows me a facebook picture making some dark humor joke about disabled people/vegetables and proceeds to try and break it down for me. My patience is literally almost gone at this point and everyone in line is getting pissed off. He has been holding up the line for about 5-8 minutes now, which when we are busy is a _LONG TIME_.

I tell him I have seen enough and that he either needs to pay now or I will be seeking assistance from my manager due to a hold up in the line. Dave has the gall to say “Oh I didn’t even notice haha my bad!” And finally gives me his damn card. 

I swipe it as fast as I can and try have him sign even faster, but instead of signing he decides to ask me “Is it appropriate to sign this as Donald Duck? I really identify as a duck now just like all these stupid millennials. Did you know that they made up a bunch more genders? Some of them even think they are both! If they can have both parts then surely I can be a duck-“ 

I cut him off. I snatch away his unsigned receipt. I have had enough. 

In my rudest tone of voice I loudly tell him 
“That will be all sir we can do without your signature. Now please, see yourself out or I will have you escorted out for your behavior. This behavior is not appropriate, you are preventing other customers from paying and causing a scene. 

This is the very limit of my professionalism and I am honestly shocked/proud of myself for not fucking screaming at this old pervy homophobic trash can in front of everyone. If he had said one more word I would’ve lost my shit. 

Dave looked shocked and his face turned red and he walked out of the building. I haven’t seen him back at the restaurant since, I think he was embarrassed enough not to come back. 

Also, he hardly ever tips the waitress/waiter. Please, if you are like Dave, stay far _*far*_ away from me in hell where you belong. 

TL;DR: 
Old guy Dave comes into place I work at, never tips, n’ makes inappropriate jokes to the staff. One day after making disgusting jokes and holding up a huge line for 10 minutes with a stupid facebook thing and homophobic comments about millennials and gender. I yell at the guy and he left embarrassed/hasn’t come back.

10,,TalesFromYourServer,"Went to a saki/sushi place last night late, it was out in the suburbs. I'd never been there before but, as a vegetarian, you can usually get a vegetable roll without much trouble. Plus warm saki on a cold night seemed nice. 

It was after nine, probably 9:30 p.m., but the open sign was lit up. 

I had my phone and headphones at the ready. I normally eat alone and I enjoy podcasts but the waitress, Kim, introduced herself and asked me my name and then proceeded to hover around me to a degree that seemed overly familiar. After I ordered warm saki and a roll and she brought me, without me asking, two packets of green tea--no hot water. She told me how delicious the green tea is (the packets are literally marked with the most generic green tea logo you'd imagine) and she asked me to tip her in cash so her manager couldn't take a cut. 

I told her I don't carry cash. 

She then told me how I could use cold green tea packets for my eyes (I don't know the details) on my eyes to relax. Again, she hovered and asked when I'd be back. 

To note, she seemed older. As am I. 

I'm 42 and while not weirdly disfigured or misshapen also just a regular guy, in no way notable or overly attractive. I generally go without note from the opposite gender and I""m fine with that--I have a GF and whatnot so I'm not seeking anyone's attention. 

Anyway, TLDR she left her schedule and her name on my receipt and I""m curious if that plus her request for cash, plus the fact that she'd repeat my name at every interaction is a sign of anything untoward? Is this some kind of weird prostitution thing? It was by far the most unusual interaction I've had in the US (and having traveled to Asia I'm used to the weirdly forward nature of sex workers there and this KIND OF reminded me of that). 

The whole experience was very off putting to the point where I'll certainly never go back and while I never write reviews, I kinda want to write one because it was ... odd to say the least.

((Post here: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/euj234/dude_you_aint_the_only_person_in_the_store/)""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/euj234/dude_you_aint_the_only_person_in_the_store/)&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He entered looked at me and demanded &amp;quot;Where is my food?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll check on it. Is it for here or to go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He snapped &amp;quot;Here!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go and check and it was just about done. I went out and informed him. He paid and sat down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was done I brought it to him and he looks at me and says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I told you I was 2 minutes away. Why wasn&amp;#39;t it ready yet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled and said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, sir. We were in the middle of our lunch rush at that time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rolled his eyes and said &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s empty now&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look around at our 2 biggest tables filled with customers and 3 little ones filled. Yeah...empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologized again and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
